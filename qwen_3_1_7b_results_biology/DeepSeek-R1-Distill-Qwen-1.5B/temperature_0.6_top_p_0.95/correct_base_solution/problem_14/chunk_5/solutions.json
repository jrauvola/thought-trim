The resulting colonies are split into two groups: half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Then, four plques are found on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember something about the Hill coefficient being related to recombination rates. The Hill coefficient measures how effective selection is against the mutants. If there's complete recombination, the Hill coefficient should be close to 1. When there's no recombination, it might be lower or even negative if one mutation completely masks the other. \n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. The first group was 1:10^7, which means each colony has 1/10 million cells. Plated on strain B's lawn, so any plque here would have been from strain B unless the mutation affects the phage. Similarly, the second group was 1:10^5, so each colony has 1/100,000 cells, and it's plated on strain K's lawn. \n\nWait, the problem states that the other half is plated on strain K, meaning the same strain as the original. So the first group comes from strain B, and the second from K. But what's important is whether the mutation leads to lethality in either strain. \n\nSince only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, the lysogenic variant must cause a problem when it replicates inside B's cells. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K, so maybe it's because it doesn't replicate well there. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage has a different replication mechanism.\n\nThe key point is that when you mix two mutantphages, the outcome depends on whether their effects are additive or masking each other. If the two mutations recombine, then each will act differently in the same host, leading to more variability. \n\nThe Hill coefficient H is calculated as the number of plques per unit dilution curve at the maximum slope. When H approaches 1, it suggests full complementation (no recombination), whereas values less than 1 indicate incomplete recombination. However, sometimes it's used inversely; higher H means less recombination. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me recall: H=1 is 100% recombination, and higher H indicates fewer recombinations. So if H is around 0.4, for example, that would mean 25% recombination.\n\nBut wait, the problem gives specific numbers: 4 on K and 40 on B. Let me see how these relate. The dilutions are 1:10^7 and 1:10^5. The number of plques in the first group is 4, which is much lower than expected if the mutation was lethal in both strains. If the mutation were lethal in both, you'd expect more plques in both groups, but since only B is affected, the first group should have fewer plques than the second.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because the first group is from strain B and the second from K. So if the mutation in strain B is lethal, you'd expect fewer plques in the B group. Since the B group had 4 plques and the K group had 40, that suggests that the mutation is less harmful in B than in K? Or vice versa?\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the concept of lethality and susceptibility. If the mutation in strain B makes the phage lethal, then in the B group, the phage shouldn't survive, so you wouldn't get many plques. In the K group, where the mutation isn't lethal, you might get some plques. That's why the B group had fewer plques than the K group.\n\nNow, regarding recombination: if the two mutations are linked, then each would produce a different offspring phenotype, affecting the growth rate of the bacteria. This would lead to varying survival rates among the bacteria, which can be detected through plque counts. \n\nThe Hill coefficient could help determine how much recombination occurs. If the mutations are tightly linked, the Hill coefficient might approach 1, indicating high recombination. If they're unlinked, the Hill coefficient would be lower, say around 0.5 or so.\n\nGiven the data, we can calculate the number of recombinant plques relative to the total possible. The formula for the proportion of recombinant plques is (number of recombinant plques)/(total plques + recombinant plques). \n\nHere, the B group had 4 plques, and the K group had 40. Assuming that the total number of plques is 4 + 40 = 44. The number of recombinant plques would depend on how many plques are due to recombination. However, without knowing the exact number of recombinants, it's tricky. \n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the Hill coefficient, H, which is given by:\n\nH = (number of plques at the lowest slope) / (total plques)\n\nIf H > 1, it implies recombination, and H </think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So if the total colonies on B are 40 and on K are 40, how does that relate? Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial infection leads to some percentage of cells being lysed by each mutation type, and when mixed, the probability of both events happening determines the outcome. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and vice versa for K, but their presence together might lead to double effects or no effect at all depending on whether there's any recombination between the mutations.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations occurred in the same phage or different phages. If they're in the same phage, the mutations would be inherited together, leading to a higher chance of causing issues. However, since each mutation affects only one type of phage, the recombination would determine whether both phages are present in the same host.\n\nLooking back at the experiment: half the colony is plated on strain B (so affected by lysogenic phage), and half on strain K (affected by the other mutation). The number of plasmid copies (plasmas) in each half is determined by dilution. The first half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning each cell has 1e-7 of the phage DNA. After replication, it doubles, so each daughter cell gets 2e-7 phage DNA. Diluting further with 1:10^7 more would give 4e-8 per cell, which is less than 1e-7, so most cells will be free. But wait, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself.\n\nIf both mutations are present in the same phage, the chance that the phage uses either mutation depends on the number of possible combinations. Since each mutation is independent, the probability that both occur is the product of their individual probabilities. But without knowing the exact frequencies, this approach seems tricky.\n\nHowever, the key point is that when both mutants are present, the offspring colonies will be positive only if both mutations occurred in the same phage. Otherwise, only one mutation would cause an issue. \n\nIn the experiment, when half of the colony is plated on strain B, only those plates where the lysogenic phage caused lysis would show a positive result. Similarly, the other half plated on strain K would show positive only if the phage was lysogenic for K. But since these are different strains, the likelihood of both mutations occurring in the same phage is low. \n\nBut according to the results, four were found on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the majority of colonies were positive on B, implying that the lysogenic phage was the dominant factor, likely from strain B. This implies that the lysogenic phage is very common among strain B phages, suggesting that the mutation is strong enough to dominate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating it. The question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination typically refers to the exchange of genetic material during meiosis, but in phages, recombination would mean that the two mutations occurred in different phages. If both mutations happened in the same phage, then the recombination rate would be high, and the offspring would inherit both mutations. Conversely, if they occurred in different phages, the offspring would have neither.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage only affects strain B, and the other mutation affects strain K, the likelihood of both mutations being present in the same phage is low. Therefore, the recombination rate would be low, meaning little chance that both mutations happen in the same phage. \n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (p + q - pq)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of one mutation, and q is the frequency of the other. Assuming equal frequencies (since no data is given about their occurrence rates), let's say p = q = x. Then:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (x + x - x^2) = 1 - 2x + x^2\n\nWe know that the observed recombinant plasmids (both mutations) are few, as the majority are positive on strain B. Let's assume that the recombination frequency is low, say 1% (option A). Plugging into the equation:\n\n1 - 2x + x^2 \u2248 0.01\n\nAssuming x is small, x^2 is negligible, so approximately:\n\n1 - 2x \u2248 0.01 \u2192 2x \u2248 0.99 \u2192 x \u2248 0.495\n\nSo the frequency is about 49.5%, meaning each mutation occurs about 50% of the time independently. But this contradicts our expectation that recombination would reduce the frequency significantly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Alternatively, using the formula for recombination frequency F:\n\nF = 1 - (f1 + f2 - f1*f2)\n\nWhere f1 and f2 are the frequencies of each mutation. If F is low, like 0.01, then:\n\n0.01 = 1 - (f1 + f2 - f1*f2)\n\nRearranging:\n\nf1 + f2 - f1*f2 = 0.99\n\nAssuming f1 = f2 = x,\n\n2x - x^2 = 0.99\n\nWhich gives a quadratic equation:\n\nx^2 - 2x + 0.99 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula:\n\nx = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 3.96)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(0.04)] / 2 = [2 \u00b1 0.2]/2\n\nPositive solution: (2.2)/2=1.1 >1, which isn't possible. Negative solution: (1.8)/2=0.9\n\nThus, x\u22480.9, meaning each mutation occurs 90% of the time, which contradicts our earlier assumption that recombination reduces the frequency.\n\nThis suggests that my approach may be flawed.

    "rollout": " But when the same phages infect strain K, which isn't affected, that suggests there's some recombination or mixing of these mutations.\n\nThe experiment involves a double cross where both types of phages are used on a population of E. coli strain B. After incubation, the bacteria are split into two groups: half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. The results show four plaques on strain K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If the phages cause issues when mixed with strain B, why would the K strain have more successes? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the plating works. Dilution affects the probability of the mutation being present, right? So diluting 1:10^7 means each plate has fewer phages, increasing the chance that a phage actually carries the mutation. Similarly, 1:10^5 makes each plate even less likely to have a phage with the mutation.\n\nSo, when the phages are plated on strain B (the first group), the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of a successful infection. However, since only strain K was tested on the second group, maybe the outcome depends on whether the phage carries the mutation from either source. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"amount of recombination.\" Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic regions within the phage. If there's no recombination, all mutations would come from the same source (either all from B or all from K). If recombination occurs, parts of the mutation might be from B and others from K, affecting the overall success rate.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems like a significant difference favoring strain K. This suggests that the mutation is more prevalent in strain K than in B. Since strain B didn't have any effect, perhaps the mutation comes from K. But if there's recombination, the mutations could have come from both sources.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes without recombination. If all mutations were from B, then when plating on strain B, most would die due to lysogeny. On strain K, since the phages don't interact well, none would die, leading to a high number of successful infections. Conversely, if all mutations were from K, when plated on B, few would survive, but on K, all would succeed.\n\nIn our case, the first group (strain B) had mostly failures (40), meaning the phages didn't carry the mutation. The second group (strain K) had a small number of successes (4), indicating that some mutations came from K, especially if there was recombination. But since strain B didn't respond, maybe the majority came from K.\n\nNow, considering the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is the percentage of cases where two mutations are present in the same phage. In this context, we're dealing with two types of mutations (lytic and lysogenic). Each mutation contributes to the overall fitness of the phage.\n\nIf recombination occurred, some phages would have a mix of both mutations. When these phages infect E. coli, their combined effects determine whether the phage survives. However, since strain B didn't respond, it suggests that the lysogenic phages (which are good for E. coli) are more common in the population. Alternatively, if recombination happened, the phages carrying both mutations might have a different fitness compared to those with only one mutation.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected frequencies. If there's complete recombination, all mutations would come from the same source, which contradicts the observed results. If there's partial recombination, some mutations would arise from each source, influencing the outcome.\n\nGiven the results, strain K showed 4 successes out of 40, whereas strain B had 40 failures.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the same phages infect strain K, which isn't affected, that suggests there's some recombination or mixing of these mutations.\n\nThe experiment involves a double cross where both types of phages are used on a population of E. coli strain B. After incubation, the bacteria are split into two groups: half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. The results show four plaques on strain K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, that seems a bit counterintuitive. If the phages cause issues when mixed with strain B, why would the K strain have more successes? Maybe I'm misunderstanding how the plating works. Dilution affects the probability of the mutation being present, right? So diluting 1:10^7 means each plate has fewer phages, increasing the chance that a phage actually carries the mutation. Similarly, 1:10^5 makes each plate even less likely to have a phage with the mutation.\n\nSo, when the phages are plated on strain B (the first group), the presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of a successful infection. However, since only strain K was tested on the second group, maybe the outcome depends on whether the phage carries the mutation from either source. \n\nBut wait, the problem mentions \"amount of recombination.\" Recombination refers to the mixing of different genetic regions within the phage. If there's no recombination, all mutations would come from the same source (either all from B or all from K). If recombination occurs, parts of the mutation might be from B and others from K, affecting the overall success rate.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems like a significant difference favoring strain K. This suggests that the mutation is more prevalent in strain K than in B. Since strain B didn't have any effect, perhaps the mutation comes from K. But if there's recombination, the mutations could have come from both sources.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes without recombination. If all mutations were from B, then when plating on strain B, most would die due to lysogeny. On strain K, since the phages don't interact well, none would die, leading to a high number of successful infections. Conversely, if all mutations were from K, when plated on B, few would survive, but on K, all would succeed.\n\nIn our case, the first group (strain B) had mostly failures (40), meaning the phages didn't carry the mutation. The second group (strain K) had a small number of successes (4), indicating that some mutations came from K, especially if there was recombination. But since strain B didn't respond, maybe the majority came from K.\n\nNow, considering the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is the percentage of cases where two mutations are present in the same phage. In this context, we're dealing with two types of mutations (lytic and lysogenic). Each mutation contributes to the overall fitness of the phage.\n\nIf recombination occurred, some phages would have a mix of both mutations. When these phages infect E. coli, their combined effects determine whether the phage survives. However, since strain B didn't respond, it suggests that the lysogenic phages (which are good for E. coli) are more common in the population. Alternatively, if recombination happened, the phages carrying both mutations might have a different fitness compared to those with only one mutation.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected frequencies. If there's complete recombination, all mutations would come from the same source, which contradicts the observed results. If there's partial recombination, some mutations would arise from each source, influencing the outcome.\n\nGiven the results, strain K showed 4 successes out of 40, whereas strain B had 40 failures. The ratio here is roughly 1:10, suggesting that the mutation is rare in strain K. If recombination happened, the mutation could be partially inherited from K, reducing its frequency in the phage population. Without recombination, the mutation would be more prevalent in strain K.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequency of the mutation in the offspring would depend on the parents' contributions. If recombination occurs, the allele frequencies might average out. But without detailed calculations, it's hard to pinpoint the exact percentage.

So, the lysogenic mutation isn't present in K, while the lytic mutation is there.\n\nThe experiment involves a plate where E. coli strain B is infected by both types. The colonies that die form a half, then they're diluted 1:10^7 and plated on another lawn of strain B. The other half from strain K is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there are four pluses on K's lawn and 40 on B's. \n\nFrom what I remember, when two mutations occur at the same site and are non-recombinant, you get a certain ratio of recombinants. If they're linked, the number of recombinants depends on their physical distance. Here, since the lysogenic mutation doesn't affect strain K, and the lytic does, it suggests no interference. But wait, the presence of lysogenic should be influenced by the presence of the lytic if they are linked.\n\nWait, no. Since the lysogenic doesn't work in strain K, it means the lytic might interfere with its replication. So the presence of the lysogenic indicates that the lytic has displaced it or vice versa. That would mean they're linked because each affects the other.\n\nNow, the data shows that on strain B's lawn, four pluses appeared. On strain K's, four plus plates were also observed. Wait, that seems confusing. Let me think again. \n\nIn the first half, when they were plated on strain B, the lysogenic mutation didn't cause death because strain B isn't affected. But the lytic mutation did, so those colonies died. Then these are diluted and plated on strain B again. Similarly, the other half is from strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, so any plasmid copies would replicate normally, and perhaps some plasmids could be lost due to the lytic mutation?\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the concepts. Let me recall: In E. coli, when a phage causes lysogenic infection (lytic), it loses the plasmid DNA copy. If it causes lysogenic infection, it retains the plasmid copy because lysogenic requires the phage to lose the plasmid. But in this case, the lysogenic phage isn't affecting strain K, meaning it doesn't cause death there. However, the lysogenic phage is causing death in strain B.\n\nSo the result is that in the first population (strain B), the lysogenic mutation was present, leading to lysis. In the second population (strain K), the lysogenic mutation wasn't present, so neither lysogenic nor lytic would cause problems. Therefore, the lysogenic mutation is present only in the first sample, not the second.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. If the two mutations are non-recombinant, the resulting recombinants won't appear as much because they wouldn't be formed. Conversely, if they're linked, the recombinants will show up depending on their distance.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, we have both mutations at the same site. The lysogenic mutation (which should disrupt replication) and the lytic mutation (which removes the plasmid) are likely interfering with each other. If they are non-recombinant, only one type of mutation would survive, but here both types are present in different samples. Hmm, I might be getting confused here.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The key is that in the first sample (strain B), the lysogenic mutation caused death, so the lytic mutation must still be present because otherwise, the lysogenic couldn't replicate without being disrupted. Wait, actually, in strain B, the lysogenic phage causes death, so the lytic phage is still present because it can infect despite losing the plasmid. Or do I mix that up?\n\nNo, actually, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate without the plasmid DNA. So if a lysogenic phage is in a bacterium that already has a plasmid (like strain B), it can't replicate without losing the plasmid. Therefore, the lysogenic phage would cause lysis even if the host has a plasmid. Wait, no\u2014lytic phages require a plasmid to replicate. If a lysogenic phage is present in a host that already has a plasmid, it can't replicate; hence, the lysogenic phage dies. But if the host lacks a plasmid, the lysogenic phage can replicate and cause lysis.\n\nWait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me clarify:\n\n- Lysogenic phage: Requires plasmid to replicate.\n- Lysis phage: Can replicate without plasmid.\n\nSo in strain B, the lysogenic phage can replicate only if the host has a plasmid. If the host lacks a plasmid, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, so any lysogenic phage present would cause lysis. But the problem says that in strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad\u2014that is, it causes death. So that implies that the lysogenic phage must not be present in the absence of a plasmid. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is present, the host must have a plasmid for it to replicate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is present but the host lacks a plasmid, leading to its inability to replicate. But the problem states that in strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes death. Maybe the lysogenic phage is somehow present but can't replicate without a plasmid, so the host must have a plasmid in this context. I'm getting stuck here.\n\nLet me focus on the data. In the first sample (strain B), the lysogenic phage causes death, indicating it can replicate. The other sample (strain K) has neither mutation, so no death. Now, the test uses a double stochastic dilution method: half are dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B; the other half on strain K with a lower dilation factor.\n\nAfter incubation, four pluses were found on strain K's lawn, and 40 on strain B's. Pluses indicate successful replication, so the bacteria survived. Strain K was plated on its own lawn, and four pluses were found. Strain B was plated on strain B's lawn, and 40 pluses were found.\n\nWait, this is a bit tricky. Let me think about the expected ratios. If the two mutations are non-recombinant, the number of recombinants would depend on their proximity. But in this case, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K, suggesting that the lytic phage may be displacing the lysogenic one or vice versa.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the proportion of recombinants would be proportional to the map distance. But if they are non-recombinant, the number of recombinants would be zero, but that's not our case here.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the probability of recombination. The formula for the probability of recombination is R = (1 - (1/2)(p + q)), where p and q are the frequencies of the mutated alleles. But in this case, it's a bit different because we're dealing with double stochastic dilution.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the number of recombinant plasmids would correspond to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. So if the frequency of each mutation is low, the chance of them being together (recombination) is roughly equal to the product of their individual frequencies.\n\nBut let's apply the numbers given. In the first half, when plated on strain B, four pluses appeared. Assuming that the frequency of lysogenic mutations is high enough, but since strain B is resistant to lysogeny, the lysogenic mutation is absent there. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic mutation is present because the lysogenic phage is causing death. So in strain B, the lysogenic mutation is present, but the lytic mutation is also present because the lysogenic phage can replicate without the plasmid. So both mutations are present.\n\nWhen they are dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, four pluses appeared. When the other half was plated on strain K's lawn, four pluses appeared as well. Wait, that seems odd because strain K shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. How come the same number of pluses appeared on strain K's lawn?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: the total number of cells after dilution is 1:10^7, which is 1e7. When plated on strain B, four pluses were found. When plated on strain K, four pluses were found. But strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, so why are the same number of pluses appearing?\n\nAh! Because the original phage populations had both mutations. When they were diluted, the chance of random coincidence (recombination) increased. But in this case, both mutations occurred in the same sample, so the probability of recombination would lead to more plasmids being present than just either mutation alone.\n\nWait, but according to the data, four pluses were found on strain B's lawn and four on strain K's. That suggests that the number of plasmids present is similar in both cases. So perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a higher survival rate, but the exact calculation would involve the recombination frequency.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, the formula is F = 1 - e^{-2R}, where R is the recombination fraction. But I'm not sure about the exact steps here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids surviving is related to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If each mutation occurs at a frequency of p and q, the probability of both occurring (recombination) is pq. But if the mutations are independent, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to pq.\n\nGiven that four pluses appeared on both strains, and assuming the initial number of plasmids is N, the expected number of plasmids after dilution would be N * (pq) / (p + q), but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for double stochastic dilution. The expected number of plasmids in the first sample (strain B) is proportional to (pq) * (1/(2 * 10^7)). The same applies to the second sample.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Let's take a step back. The experiment showed that when the lysogenic mutation is present (as seen in strain B), the other mutation (lytic) is also present, leading to some plasmids. When the lysogenic mutation is missing (strain K), the lysic phage doesn't replicate, but the lytic phage does, so the plasmid count remains the same.\n\nThe number of plasmids after dilution would reflect the presence of both mutations. The fact that the same number of plasmids appear on both strains suggests that the presence of both mutations is contributing equally to the survival rate, implying a certain level of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids in the first sample is higher than in the second because the presence of the lysogenic mutation increases the likelihood of plasmid loss due to the lytic phage. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage doesn't cause death in strain B, so it must be replicating, but it doesn't necessarily cause death because the host has a plasmid. Wait, no\u2014if a lysogenic phage is in a host without a plasmid, it can't replicate, so any lysogenic phage would cause lysis. But in strain B, the lysogenic phage causes death, so the host must have a plasmid. Therefore, the lysogenic phage can replicate because the host has a plasmid. Thus, the lysogenic phage is present and can replicate, causing lysis.\n\nTherefore, in the first sample, both mutations are present (lysogenic in B, lysogenic in K?), wait no\u2014it's only the lysogenic in B causing death. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage is present in both samples because the phage itself is causing lysis in strain B.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled. Let me summarize:\n\n- Both types of mutantphages are present in the population.\n- In strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes death (lytic doesn't).\n- In strain K, neither mutation exists.\n- After dilution and plating, four pluses on strain B's lawn and four on strain K's.\n\nThis suggests that in the first sample, both mutations exist, but in the second, only the lysogenic is missing. But wait, the lysogenic phage is present in both, so that's conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that in the first sample, the lysogenic mutation is present, allowing the phage to cause lysis. In the second sample, the lysogenic mutation is missing, so the phage can't replicate, hence no death. But the lytic phage is present regardless, causing lysis in both samples.\n\nHowever, the observed results are that in the first sample, four pluses were found, and in the second, four plus plates were also found. This suggests that the same number of plasmids survived in both samples, implying that the presence of both mutations led to a certain survival rate, and without the lysogenic mutation, the same survival rate occurred.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would determine the relationship between the two mutations. If the two mutations are linked, the number of recombinant plasmids would be less than if they were independent. If they're non-recombinant, the number would be higher.\n\nBut how does this translate into the actual calculation? I think the best approach is to consider the probability of recombination. The formula for recombination frequency (R) is approximately the square root of the product of the allele frequencies (p and q) if they are independent. But in this case, we're looking for the recombination frequency between two specific mutations.\n\nWait, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K, the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the first sample suggests that the lytic phage is displacing it, implying linkage. So the recombination frequency would be significant.\n\nThe number of plasmids surviving can help us estimate the recombination frequency. Each time a plasmid is present, it contributes to the overall plasmid load. The presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of having multiple plasmids, thus increasing the chance of recombination.\n\nIn the first sample, four pluses were found on strain B's lawn, and four on strain K's. Since strain K didn't have the lysogenic mutation, the plasmids present must all be from the original phage population. In strain B, however, the lysogenic phage added additional plasmids. So the increase in plasmids in the first sample compared to the second sample gives an indication of recombination.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the original population has n plasmids. When diluted, the number of plasmids becomes n * (1e7). When plated on strain B, four plasmids survived, and when plated on strain K, four plus plates were found. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because strain K's lawn would have fewer plasmids unless the original population also included plasmids.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. The original population includes both types of mutantphages. When plated on strain B, both mutations are present, leading to some plasmids. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, leading to less plasmids. But in reality, the original population has both mutations, so when plated on strain B, some plasmids remain, including both types. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, so the number of plasmids depends on the original population.\n\nWait, no. The original population includes both types of mutantphages. So when plated on strain B, both mutations are present, leading to some plasmids. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, so the plasmids from the original population remain, plus any new ones introduced by the lytic phage.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a simpler approach. The number of plasmids in the first sample is higher than in the second because the lysogenic phage adds more plasmids. The difference in the number of plasmids corresponds to the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula relating plasmid counts and recombination frequency is:\n\nP = 1 - e^{-2R}\n\nWhere P is the probability of recombination, and R is the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the difference in plasmid counts between the two samples relates to the recombination frequency, we can set up the equation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the original population has N plasmids. In the first sample (strain B), after dilution, there are N * (1e7) plasmids. Some of these plasmids have both mutations (recombined), some have only the lysogenic (non-recombined), and others have only the lytic.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample (strain K), the plasmids are mostly intact except for the ones that have been replicated by the lytic phage. The lytic phage can replicate without the plasmid, so the plasmids that were not displaced by the lysogenic phage remain, and the ones that were displaced become unreplicated.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the presence of both mutations in the first sample suggests that the lysogenic phage is displacing the lysogenic mutation, which implies a high degree of recombination. The number of plasmids in the first sample relative to the second would give an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nSince the same number of plasmids appeared on both samples, it suggests that the presence of both mutations increased the number of plasmids in such a way that the same number survived when plated on either strain. This implies that the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest recombination frequencies are options G (0.5%) and H (5%). Lower frequencies are options A through D.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows a noticeable increase in plasmid numbers in the first sample, which suggests a high recombination frequency, the most plausible answer would be either G or H.\n\nBetween 0.05% and 0.5%, 0.5% is closer to a high value, so option G (0.5%) is likely the answer.\n\nWait, but I thought the formula involved the natural logarithm. Let me check the approximation: R \u2248 (1/2) ln(1/P). If P is the probability of recombination, then ln(1/P) is twice the recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose the probability of recombination R is 0.05%, then ln(1/0.0005) \u2248 ln(2000)",

The formula for the probability of recombination is R = (1 - (1/2)(p + q)), where p and q are the frequencies of the mutated alleles. But in this case, it's a bit different because we're dealing with double stochastic dilution.\n\nAnother way to think about it is that the number of recombinant plasmids would correspond to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. So if the frequency of each mutation is low, the chance of them being together (recombination) is roughly equal to the product of their individual frequencies.\n\nBut let's apply the numbers given. In the first half, when plated on strain B, four pluses appeared. Assuming that the frequency of lysogenic mutations is high enough, but since strain B is resistant to lysogeny, the lysogenic mutation is absent there. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic mutation is present because the lysogenic phage is causing death. So in strain B, the lysogenic mutation is present, but the lytic mutation is also present because the lysogenic phage can replicate without the plasmid. So both mutations are present.\n\nWhen they are dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, four pluses appeared. When the other half was plated on strain K's lawn, four pluses appeared as well. Wait, that seems odd because strain K shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. How come the same number of pluses appeared on strain K's lawn?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Let me clarify: the total number of cells after dilution is 1:10^7, which is 1e7. When plated on strain B, four pluses were found. When plated on strain K, four pluses were found. But strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, so why are the same number of pluses appearing?\n\nAh! Because the original phage populations had both mutations. When they were diluted, the chance of random coincidence (recombination) increased. But in this case, both mutations occurred in the same sample, so the probability of recombination would lead to more plasmids being present than just either mutation alone.\n\nWait, but according to the data, four pluses were found on strain B's lawn and four on strain K's. That suggests that the number of plasmids present is similar in both cases. So perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a higher survival rate, but the exact calculation would involve the recombination frequency.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, the formula is F = 1 - e^{-2R}, where R is the recombination fraction. But I'm not sure about the exact steps here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids surviving is related to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If each mutation occurs at a frequency of p and q, the probability of both occurring (recombination) is pq. But if the mutations are independent, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to pq.\n\nGiven that four pluses appeared on both strains, and assuming the initial number of plasmids is N, the expected number of plasmids after dilution would be N * (pq) / (p + q), but I'm not entirely confident.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for double stochastic dilution. The expected number of plasmids in the first sample (strain B) is proportional to (pq) * (1/(2 * 10^7)). The same applies to the second sample.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Let's take a step back. The experiment showed that when the lysogenic mutation is present (as seen in strain B), the other mutation (lytic) is also present, leading to some plasmids. When the lysogenic mutation is missing (strain K), the lysic phage doesn't replicate, but the lytic phage does, so the plasmid count remains the same.\n\nThe number of plasmids after dilution would reflect the presence of both mutations. The fact that the same number of plasmids appear on both strains suggests that the presence of both mutations is contributing equally to the survival rate, implying a certain level of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids in the first sample is higher than in the second because the presence of the lysogenic mutation increases the likelihood of plasmid loss due to the lytic phage. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage doesn't cause death in strain B, so it must be replicating, but it doesn't necessarily cause death because the host has a plasmid. Wait, no\u2014if a lysogenic phage is in a host without a plasmid, it can't replicate, so any lysogenic phage would cause lysis. But in strain B, the lysogenic phage causes death, so the host must have a plasmid. Therefore, the lysogenic phage can replicate because the host has a plasmid. Thus, the lysogenic phage is present and can replicate, causing lysis.\n\nTherefore, in the first sample, both mutations are present (lysogenic in B, lysogenic in K?), wait no\u2014it's only the lysogenic in B causing death. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage is present in both samples because the phage itself is causing lysis in strain B.\n\nWait, now I'm getting tangled. Let me summarize:\n\n- Both types of mutantphages are present in the population.\n- In strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes death (lytic doesn't).\n- In strain K, neither mutation exists.\n- After dilution and plating, four pluses on strain B's lawn and four on strain K's.\n\nThis suggests that in the first sample, both mutations exist, but in the second, only the lysogenic is missing. But wait, the lysogenic phage is present in both, so that's conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that in the first sample, the lysogenic mutation is present, allowing the phage to cause lysis. In the second sample, the lysogenic mutation is missing, so the phage can't replicate, hence no death. But the lytic phage is present regardless, causing lysis in both samples.\n\nHowever, the observed results are that in the first sample, four pluses were found, and in the second, four plus plates were also found. This suggests that the same number of plasmids survived in both samples, implying that the presence of both mutations led to a certain survival rate, and without the lysogenic mutation, the same survival rate occurred.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would determine the relationship between the two mutations. If the two mutations are linked, the number of recombinant plasmids would be less than if they were independent. If they're non-recombinant, the number would be higher.\n\nBut how does this translate into the actual calculation? I think the best approach is to consider the probability of recombination. The formula for recombination frequency (R) is approximately the square root of the product of the allele frequencies (p and q) if they are independent. But in this case, we're looking for the recombination frequency between two specific mutations.\n\nWait, but since the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain K, the presence of the lysogenic mutation in the first sample suggests that the lytic phage is displacing it, implying linkage. So the recombination frequency would be significant.\n\nThe number of plasmids surviving can help us estimate the recombination frequency. Each time a plasmid is present, it contributes to the overall plasmid load. The presence of both mutations increases the likelihood of having multiple plasmids, thus increasing the chance of recombination.\n\nIn the first sample, four pluses were found on strain B's lawn, and four on strain K's. Since strain K didn't have the lysogenic mutation, the plasmids present must all be from the original phage population. In strain B, however, the lysogenic phage added additional plasmids. So the increase in plasmids in the first sample compared to the second sample gives an indication of recombination.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose the original population has n plasmids. When diluted, the number of plasmids becomes n * (1e7). When plated on strain B, four plasmids survived, and when plated on strain K, four plus plates were found. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because strain K's lawn would have fewer plasmids unless the original population also included plasmids.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the process. The original population includes both types of mutantphages. When plated on strain B, both mutations are present, leading to some plasmids. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, leading to less plasmids. But in reality, the original population has both mutations, so when plated on strain B, some plasmids remain, including both types. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, so the number of plasmids depends on the original population.\n\nWait, no. The original population includes both types of mutantphages. So when plated on strain B, both mutations are present, leading to some plasmids. When plated on strain K, only the lytic phage is present, so the plasmids from the original population remain, plus any new ones introduced by the lytic phage.\n\nHmm, this is getting too complicated. Let me try to find a simpler approach. The number of plasmids in the first sample is higher than in the second because the lysogenic phage adds more plasmids. The difference in the number of plasmids corresponds to the recombination frequency.\n\nThe formula relating plasmid counts and recombination frequency is:\n\nP = 1 - e^{-2R}\n\nWhere P is the probability of recombination, and R is the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the difference in plasmid counts between the two samples relates to the recombination frequency, we can set up the equation.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the original population has N plasmids. In the first sample (strain B), after dilution, there are N * (1e7) plasmids. Some of these plasmids have both mutations (recombined), some have only the lysogenic (non-recombined), and others have only the lytic.\n\nSimilarly, in the second sample (strain K), the plasmids are mostly intact except for the ones that have been replicated by the lytic phage. The lytic phage can replicate without the plasmid, so the plasmids that were not displaced by the lysogenic phage remain, and the ones that were displaced become unreplicated.\n\nBut this is getting too detailed. Perhaps a better approach is to realize that the presence of both mutations in the first sample suggests that the lysogenic phage is displacing the lysogenic mutation, which implies a high degree of recombination. The number of plasmids in the first sample relative to the second would give an idea of the recombination frequency.\n\nSince the same number of plasmids appeared on both samples, it suggests that the presence of both mutations increased the number of plasmids in such a way that the same number survived when plated on either strain. This implies that the recombination frequency is high.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest recombination frequencies are options G (0.5%) and H (5%). Lower frequencies are options A through D.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows a noticeable increase in plasmid numbers in the first sample, which suggests a high recombination frequency, the most plausible answer would be either G or H.\n\nBetween 0.05% and 0.5%, 0.5% is closer to a high value, so option G (0.5%) is likely the answer.\n\nWait, but I thought the formula involved the natural logarithm. Let me check the approximation: R \u2248 (1/2) ln(1/P). If P is the probability of recombination, then ln(1/P) is twice the recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose the probability of recombination R is 0.05%, then ln(1/0.0005) \u2248 ln(2000)",

Then, the bacteria are treated with an exponential plate divided into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 (which means each bacterium has a chance to replicate 10^7 times), and the other is diluted 1:10^5. These are plated onto different bacterial backgrounds: one against E. coli strain B and another against strain K.\n\nFrom the results, we have four pluses on K and 40 on B. I think this relates to the likelihood of recombination since if the mutations are linked, their occurrence would be dependent. Recombination frequency tells us the percentage of cases where the two mutations occur independently.\n\nIn a typical case without recombination, the probability of a plasmid carrying both mutations being detected would depend on the dilution factors. Here, for B, it's 1:10^7, which is a lot more likely than 1:10^5 for K. This suggests that the mutations are tightly linked because the same plasmids are being used across both plates.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) when dealing with multiple mutations is given by RF = (p + q - pq)^2 / (pq(1-p)(1-q)), but I'm not sure if that applies here directly. Alternatively, in the context of independent assortment, the expected number of recombinant offspring can be calculated using the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring at each replication event.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. Since the phages are present at different concentrations (dilutions), the number of plasmids should reflect the concentration. For E. coli strain B, the higher dilution (1:10^7) might indicate fewer plasmids, implying less recombination compared to a lower dilution (1:10^5).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the observed data. If the mutations are linked, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on the frequencies of the two mutations. However, in this scenario, both mutations are causing issues, so maybe it's about how often both mutations occur on the same plasmid.\n\nAlternatively, considering the plate results: four pluses on K and 40 on B. Maybe the ratio of plasmid presence between the two plates reflects the linkage. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall that when dealing with multiple mutations, the expected number of recombinants can be estimated as (number of plasmids at B plate \u00d7 number at K plate) \u00d7 (probability of recombination once).\n\nWait, no. Perhaps the correct way is to use the formula RF = (1 - (N_B + N_K)) / (Total possible), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the numbers are high (40 vs 4), it suggests that the mutations are closely linked, meaning low recombination frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options, some are percentages like 0.02% or 0.05%. Wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination, which I think refers to the percentage of cases where both mutations occur. So if the RF is low, say 0.05%, that would mean a very low chance of recombination.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the mutations are tightly linked, the expected number of recombinants would be minimal. The formula for the expected number is p * q * (dilution factor), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants could be (N_B * N_K) * RF, where RF is the recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, assuming each represents a potential recombination point, the total possible recombinations would be 40 * 4 = 160. But if RF is low, say 0.05%, then 160 * 0.0005 = 0.08, but that seems too low. Alternatively, if RF is 0.02%, then 160 * 0.0002 = 0.032, still low.\n\nBut wait, the actual number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. So the expected number of recombinants would be 40 * 4 * RF. From the results, maybe the number of plasmids indicates how many times each mutation occurred. If 40 plasmids were formed from B and 4 from K, the expected number of recombinants would be 40*4*RF. But since the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B, perhaps these correspond to the number of plasmids. Wait, but the initial description says four pluses on K and 40 on B. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids corresponds to the frequency of each mutation. So, if you have 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, and the RF is x%, then the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (40 + 4) * x/100. But from the results, we have specific counts, so maybe that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the higher dilution (1:10^7) leads to fewer plasmids, indicating less recombination, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) leads to more plasmids, suggesting more recombination. Given that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B, perhaps K has fewer plasmids, so the recombination frequency is low.\n\nIf I assume that the number of plasmids indicates the degree of recombination, then a significant difference in plasmid count between the two plates suggests a low RF. The difference here is 40 vs 4, which is a factor of 10. In terms of RF, if each additional plasmid increases the possibility of recombination, then the ratio of plasmids could be related to the RF.\n\nSo if there are 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the probability of recombination is inversely proportional to the number of plasmids? Or perhaps the log of the ratio gives the RF. Taking logs, ln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3. Exponentiating, e^(2.3) \u2248 9.95. That seems too high, probably not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the fact that when mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinants depends on the square of the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids determines the likelihood of recombination. Each plasmid represents a separate origin of replication, so if a plasmid carries both mutations, it will cause recombination. Therefore, the number of such plasmids would relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nSince the phages are present at different concentrations (dilutions), the plasmids must carry them. So, on the B plate, there are 40 plasmids, each representing a potential recombination site. On the K plate, 4 plasmids. If the recombination occurs in 40% of the plasmids, then 40 * 0.4 = 16 recombinants on B, and 4 * 0.4 = 1.6 on K. But from the results, 40 on B and 4 on K, which doesn't align with this.\n\nWait, but the exact number of plasmids might not matter; instead, the fact that the higher dilution (B) has more plasmids implies that more recombination happened there, but our results show fewer plasmids leading to fewer recombinants. That's confusing.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the higher dilution (B) allows more plasmids, so more opportunities for recombination. But according to the results, fewer plasmids led to fewer recombinants, which contradicts my earlier assumption. So perhaps I got it backwards.\n\nWait, actually, higher dilution means fewer plasmids per bacterium, which would imply fewer chances for recombination events. So if the result shows fewer plasmids on B (40 vs 4), that suggests fewer recombinations on B, which matches the observation of fewer plasmids leading to fewer plasmid-free colonies. But according to the problem statement, the K plate had fewer plasmids, leading to more recombinants?\n\nWait, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. So on K, there are fewer plasmids (4) leading to fewer recombinants, but on B, more plasmids (40) leading to more recombinants. But the results show the opposite: four on B, which would suggest fewer plasmids, leading to fewer recombinants, but the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the problem is structured differently. The initial part says that T_4 phages with mutations in rII cause lytic fission in E. coli B but not K. Then, in the experiment, two types of mutantphages are present simultaneously. The results are that half is dilated 1:10^7 (more plasmids) and the other half is 1:10^5 (fewer plasmids). Plated on B and K, respectively.\n\nWait, the result is that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B. So K has fewer plasmids, implying fewer recombinants, and B has more plasmids, implying more recombinants. But according to the problem, the B plate was plated on strain B, which shouldn't have any recombination because the lysogenic phage doesn't do anything there. So why did B get more plasmids leading to more recombinants? That's contradictory.\n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the role of the phage types. The lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse the cell) is on the B plate, which shouldn't cause recombination. But the experiment showed four plasmids on B, which suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't lyse, hence no recombination. Similarly, the K plate has fewer plasmids, implying more recombination.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) should carry plasmids that don't cause recombination, whereas the lytic phage (that does lyse) might carry more plasmids with recombination sites. So, in the B plate, the lysogenic phage (no recombination) carries more plasmids (since it's a lower dilution), resulting in more plasmids and thus more recombinants. But wait, the problem says four plasmids on B and 40 on K. So the B plate has fewer plasmids, leading to fewer recombinants, but the problem states four on B. Hmm, this is getting tangled.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\n- Both mutantphages (lytic and lysogenic) are present.\n- On the B plate, the lysogenic phage (no recombination) is present, so it carries fewer plasmids (due to lower dilution).\n- On the K plate, the lysogenic phage (does recombination) is present, so it carries more plasmids.\n- Results: B plate has 4 plasmids \u2192 fewer recombinants, K plate has 40 plasmids \u2192 more recombinants.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination, so the B plate should have fewer plasmids, explaining why it has four. And the lysogenic phage on K causes recombination, so K plate has more plasmids, resulting in 40 recombinants.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plasmids on the K plate compared to B. Since K has 40 plasmids and B has 4, the ratio is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is approximately 1% (since 10:1 corresponds to a 1% chance of recombination per plasmid).\n\nWait, but the options include D as 0.05% and F as 0.3%. So 1% isn't among them. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: 40 plasmids on K, 4 on B. The ratio is 10:1, which would translate to a recombination frequency of 1/(1+10)\u22480.091, which is about 9.1%. That's even higher, but none of the options match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the proportion of plasmids that carry the mutation. If the lysogenic phage requires a recombination site, its plasmids carry it. The lysic phage doesn't. So, if the lysogenic phage is on the B plate, it's a lower dilution (higher chance of fewer plasmids), hence fewer recombinants. Conversely, the lysogenic phage on the K plate is a higher dilution (lower chance of fewer plasmids), hence more recombinants.\n\nThe number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. So the ratio is 40:4=10:1. To find the recombination frequency, we can model it as follows: suppose the total number of plasmids is 44 (40 on B, 4 on K). The expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (total plasmids) * RF. But since we know the number of recombinants on each plate, maybe it's better to think in terms of the individual ratios.\n\nOn B, 40 plasmids, and only 4 are recombinants. So the recombination frequency on B would be 4/40=0.1 or 10%.\n\nOn K, 4 plasmids, 40 recombinants. Wait, that can't be right because K has only 4 plasmids, so you can't have 40 recombinants. That suggests that all 4 plasmids on K caused recombination, but the problem says 40. That's impossible unless I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers represent the number of colonies, not the plasmids. If 40 colonies appeared on B, that could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't cause recombination (as it shouldn't), so fewer plasmids. Similarly, 40 colonies on K mean that the lysogenic phage caused recombination, implying more plasmids. But I thought the problem stated that four were found on K, not 40. Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Yes, so four on K and 40 on B. That means on K, despite having fewer plasmids, all of them caused recombination, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the higher dilution (B) has more plasmids, leading to more recombinants, but in reality, the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination, so it shouldn't have any plasmids that carry the mutation. Hence, B has fewer plasmids, so fewer recombinants, but the problem says four.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try another angle. The number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. The recombination frequency would be the ratio of plasmids that carry both mutations. If the lysogenic phage on B doesn't carry the mutation (since it's a no-recombination phage), then the plasmids on B don't carry the mutation. On K, the lysogenic phage does carry the mutation, so the plasmids on K do carry it. Thus, the number of recombinant plasmids would be equal to the number of plasmids on K, which is 4.\n\nBut the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. Wait, that doesn't add up. It must mean that on B, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, so fewer plasmids, hence fewer recombinants. But the problem says four on B, which would imply that all plasmids on B caused recombination, which isn't possible. So perhaps the phage types are different in their susceptibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination because it doesn't lyse the cell, whereas the lysogenic phage on K does cause recombination because it does lyse the cell. So on the B plate, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, so it carries fewer plasmids. On the K plate, the lysogenic phage does cause recombination, so it carries more plasmids. \n\nThus, the number of plasmids on B is 40, and on K is 4. The ratio is 40:4=10:1. Assuming that the number of recombinant plasmids is proportional to the number of plasmids on each plate, then the recombination frequency would be the ratio of plasmids on K to the total plasmids (but that doesn't seem right). Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage on K causes recombination, the number of plasmids on K is proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is x%, then the number of plasmids on K would be proportional to x. Since K has 4 plasmids and B has 40, the ratio is 4:40=1:10. Taking the logarithm (base 10), log(10)=1, which would correspond to a recombination frequency of 100%, but that's unlikely. Alternatively, taking natural log, ln(10)=2.3, so RF=e^2.3\u224810, which also doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that the recombination frequency is the ratio of plasmids on K to the sum of plasmids on both plates. So plasmids on K (4) divided by total plasmids (44) equals 4/44\u22489.09%, which rounds to 9.1%. Again, not matching the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on K is 4 and on B is 40, the ratio is 1:10. Taking the reciprocal (1/10), which is 0.1, corresponding to 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nWait, looking back at the options",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. Strain K isn't affected because it's the lytic phage that does the damage there.\n\nThe experiment involves a double mutation\u2014so both types of phages are present together. Then, the bacteria are treated with an exponential plate divided into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 (which means each bacterium has a chance to replicate 10^7 times), and the other is diluted 1:10^5. These are plated onto different bacterial backgrounds: one against E. coli strain B and another against strain K.\n\nFrom the results, we have four pluses on K and 40 on B. I think this relates to the likelihood of recombination since if the mutations are linked, their occurrence would be dependent. Recombination frequency tells us the percentage of cases where the two mutations occur independently.\n\nIn a typical case without recombination, the probability of a plasmid carrying both mutations being detected would depend on the dilution factors. Here, for B, it's 1:10^7, which is a lot more likely than 1:10^5 for K. This suggests that the mutations are tightly linked because the same plasmids are being used across both plates.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) when dealing with multiple mutations is given by RF = (p + q - pq)^2 / (pq(1-p)(1-q)), but I'm not sure if that applies here directly. Alternatively, in the context of independent assortment, the expected number of recombinant offspring can be calculated using the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring at each replication event.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. Since the phages are present at different concentrations (dilutions), the number of plasmids should reflect the concentration. For E. coli strain B, the higher dilution (1:10^7) might indicate fewer plasmids, implying less recombination compared to a lower dilution (1:10^5).\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants based on the observed data. If the mutations are linked, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on the frequencies of the two mutations. However, in this scenario, both mutations are causing issues, so maybe it's about how often both mutations occur on the same plasmid.\n\nAlternatively, considering the plate results: four pluses on K and 40 on B. Maybe the ratio of plasmid presence between the two plates reflects the linkage. But I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall that when dealing with multiple mutations, the expected number of recombinants can be estimated as (number of plasmids at B plate \u00d7 number at K plate) \u00d7 (probability of recombination once).\n\nWait, no. Perhaps the correct way is to use the formula RF = (1 - (N_B + N_K)) / (Total possible), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, since the numbers are high (40 vs 4), it suggests that the mutations are closely linked, meaning low recombination frequency.\n\nLooking back at the options, some are percentages like 0.02% or 0.05%. Wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination, which I think refers to the percentage of cases where both mutations occur. So if the RF is low, say 0.05%, that would mean a very low chance of recombination.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the mutations are tightly linked, the expected number of recombinants would be minimal. The formula for the expected number is p * q * (dilution factor), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, the expected number of recombinants could be (N_B * N_K) * RF, where RF is the recombination fraction.\n\nGiven that there are 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, assuming each represents a potential recombination point, the total possible recombinations would be 40 * 4 = 160. But if RF is low, say 0.05%, then 160 * 0.0005 = 0.08, but that seems too low. Alternatively, if RF is 0.02%, then 160 * 0.0002 = 0.032, still low.\n\nBut wait, the actual number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. So the expected number of recombinants would be 40 * 4 * RF. From the results, maybe the number of plasmids indicates how many times each mutation occurred. If 40 plasmids were formed from B and 4 from K, the expected number of recombinants would be 40*4*RF. But since the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B, perhaps these correspond to the number of plasmids. Wait, but the initial description says four pluses on K and 40 on B. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids corresponds to the frequency of each mutation. So, if you have 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, and the RF is x%, then the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (40 + 4) * x/100. But from the results, we have specific counts, so maybe that's not accurate.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the higher dilution (1:10^7) leads to fewer plasmids, indicating less recombination, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) leads to more plasmids, suggesting more recombination. Given that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B, perhaps K has fewer plasmids, so the recombination frequency is low.\n\nIf I assume that the number of plasmids indicates the degree of recombination, then a significant difference in plasmid count between the two plates suggests a low RF. The difference here is 40 vs 4, which is a factor of 10. In terms of RF, if each additional plasmid increases the possibility of recombination, then the ratio of plasmids could be related to the RF.\n\nSo if there are 40 plasmids on B and 4 on K, the ratio is 10:1. That suggests that the probability of recombination is inversely proportional to the number of plasmids? Or perhaps the log of the ratio gives the RF. Taking logs, ln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3. Exponentiating, e^(2.3) \u2248 9.95. That seems too high, probably not the right approach.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the fact that when mutations are tightly linked, the number of recombinants depends on the square of the recombination frequency. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids determines the likelihood of recombination. Each plasmid represents a separate origin of replication, so if a plasmid carries both mutations, it will cause recombination. Therefore, the number of such plasmids would relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nSince the phages are present at different concentrations (dilutions), the plasmids must carry them. So, on the B plate, there are 40 plasmids, each representing a potential recombination site. On the K plate, 4 plasmids. If the recombination occurs in 40% of the plasmids, then 40 * 0.4 = 16 recombinants on B, and 4 * 0.4 = 1.6 on K. But from the results, 40 on B and 4 on K, which doesn't align with this.\n\nWait, but the exact number of plasmids might not matter; instead, the fact that the higher dilution (B) has more plasmids implies that more recombination happened there, but our results show fewer plasmids leading to fewer recombinants. That's confusing.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the higher dilution (B) allows more plasmids, so more opportunities for recombination. But according to the results, fewer plasmids led to fewer recombinants, which contradicts my earlier assumption. So perhaps I got it backwards.\n\nWait, actually, higher dilution means fewer plasmids per bacterium, which would imply fewer chances for recombination events. So if the result shows fewer plasmids on B (40 vs 4), that suggests fewer recombinations on B, which matches the observation of fewer plasmids leading to fewer plasmid-free colonies. But according to the problem statement, the K plate had fewer plasmids, leading to more recombinants?\n\nWait, the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. So on K, there are fewer plasmids (4) leading to fewer recombinants, but on B, more plasmids (40) leading to more recombinants. But the results show the opposite: four on B, which would suggest fewer plasmids, leading to fewer recombinants, but the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. Hmm, this is conflicting.\n\nPerhaps the problem is structured differently. The initial part says that T_4 phages with mutations in rII cause lytic fission in E. coli B but not K. Then, in the experiment, two types of mutantphages are present simultaneously. The results are that half is dilated 1:10^7 (more plasmids) and the other half is 1:10^5 (fewer plasmids). Plated on B and K, respectively.\n\nWait, the result is that four plasmids were found on K and 40 on B. So K has fewer plasmids, implying fewer recombinants, and B has more plasmids, implying more recombinants. But according to the problem, the B plate was plated on strain B, which shouldn't have any recombination because the lysogenic phage doesn't do anything there. So why did B get more plasmids leading to more recombinants? That's contradictory.\n\nAh, perhaps I misunderstood the role of the phage types. The lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse the cell) is on the B plate, which shouldn't cause recombination. But the experiment showed four plasmids on B, which suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't lyse, hence no recombination. Similarly, the K plate has fewer plasmids, implying more recombination.\n\nWait, that makes sense. Because the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) should carry plasmids that don't cause recombination, whereas the lytic phage (that does lyse) might carry more plasmids with recombination sites. So, in the B plate, the lysogenic phage (no recombination) carries more plasmids (since it's a lower dilution), resulting in more plasmids and thus more recombinants. But wait, the problem says four plasmids on B and 40 on K. So the B plate has fewer plasmids, leading to fewer recombinants, but the problem states four on B. Hmm, this is getting tangled.\n\nLet me try to structure this:\n\n- Both mutantphages (lytic and lysogenic) are present.\n- On the B plate, the lysogenic phage (no recombination) is present, so it carries fewer plasmids (due to lower dilution).\n- On the K plate, the lysogenic phage (does recombination) is present, so it carries more plasmids.\n- Results: B plate has 4 plasmids \u2192 fewer recombinants, K plate has 40 plasmids \u2192 more recombinants.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination, so the B plate should have fewer plasmids, explaining why it has four. And the lysogenic phage on K causes recombination, so K plate has more plasmids, resulting in 40 recombinants.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plasmids on the K plate compared to B. Since K has 40 plasmids and B has 4, the ratio is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is approximately 1% (since 10:1 corresponds to a 1% chance of recombination per plasmid).\n\nWait, but the options include D as 0.05% and F as 0.3%. So 1% isn't among them. Maybe I made a mistake. Let's see: 40 plasmids on K, 4 on B. The ratio is 10:1, which would translate to a recombination frequency of 1/(1+10)\u22480.091, which is about 9.1%. That's even higher, but none of the options match that either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the proportion of plasmids that carry the mutation. If the lysogenic phage requires a recombination site, its plasmids carry it. The lysic phage doesn't. So, if the lysogenic phage is on the B plate, it's a lower dilution (higher chance of fewer plasmids), hence fewer recombinants. Conversely, the lysogenic phage on the K plate is a higher dilution (lower chance of fewer plasmids), hence more recombinants.\n\nThe number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. So the ratio is 40:4=10:1. To find the recombination frequency, we can model it as follows: suppose the total number of plasmids is 44 (40 on B, 4 on K). The expected number of recombinant plasmids would be (total plasmids) * RF. But since we know the number of recombinants on each plate, maybe it's better to think in terms of the individual ratios.\n\nOn B, 40 plasmids, and only 4 are recombinants. So the recombination frequency on B would be 4/40=0.1 or 10%.\n\nOn K, 4 plasmids, 40 recombinants. Wait, that can't be right because K has only 4 plasmids, so you can't have 40 recombinants. That suggests that all 4 plasmids on K caused recombination, but the problem says 40. That's impossible unless I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the numbers represent the number of colonies, not the plasmids. If 40 colonies appeared on B, that could mean that the lysogenic phage didn't cause recombination (as it shouldn't), so fewer plasmids. Similarly, 40 colonies on K mean that the lysogenic phage caused recombination, implying more plasmids. But I thought the problem stated that four were found on K, not 40. Maybe I misread.\n\nLooking back: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" Yes, so four on K and 40 on B. That means on K, despite having fewer plasmids, all of them caused recombination, which doesn't make sense. Therefore, perhaps the higher dilution (B) has more plasmids, leading to more recombinants, but in reality, the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination, so it shouldn't have any plasmids that carry the mutation. Hence, B has fewer plasmids, so fewer recombinants, but the problem says four.\n\nThis is confusing. Let's try another angle. The number of plasmids on each plate is 40 on B and 4 on K. The recombination frequency would be the ratio of plasmids that carry both mutations. If the lysogenic phage on B doesn't carry the mutation (since it's a no-recombination phage), then the plasmids on B don't carry the mutation. On K, the lysogenic phage does carry the mutation, so the plasmids on K do carry it. Thus, the number of recombinant plasmids would be equal to the number of plasmids on K, which is 4.\n\nBut the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B. Wait, that doesn't add up. It must mean that on B, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, so fewer plasmids, hence fewer recombinants. But the problem says four on B, which would imply that all plasmids on B caused recombination, which isn't possible. So perhaps the phage types are different in their susceptibility.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination because it doesn't lyse the cell, whereas the lysogenic phage on K does cause recombination because it does lyse the cell. So on the B plate, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause recombination, so it carries fewer plasmids. On the K plate, the lysogenic phage does cause recombination, so it carries more plasmids. \n\nThus, the number of plasmids on B is 40, and on K is 4. The ratio is 40:4=10:1.

So plasmids on K (4) divided by total plasmids (44) equals 4/44\u22489.09%, which rounds to 9.1%. Again, not matching the options provided.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids on K is 4 and on B is 40, the ratio is 1:10. Taking the reciprocal (1/10), which is 0.1, corresponding to 10%. But 10% isn't an option either.\n\nWait, looking back at the options",

In the first case, there are four pluses on strain B's lawn, and in the second, four on strain K. \n\nWait, what do pluses mean here? They probably indicate successful infection, right? So if four pluses are found on strain B's lawn, each positive means four bacteria were successfully lysed. Similarly, four on strain K would be another four infections. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations in the phage's gene interact. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage won't affect the lysogenic lysogen anymore. But if they recombine, the lysogenic phage could now cause lysing. \n\nSo when both mutants are present, some might have recombined. If the recombination rate is high, more plasmids will show the effect. Let's think about the dilutions. The first dilution is 1:10^7, which is very low. That suggests that only a small fraction of the phage copies would cause an infection. The second dilution is 1:10^5, which is higher than the first, meaning more phages are present, increasing the chance of more infections.\n\nThe number of pluses depends on the probability of recombination. If the recombination rate is R (as a decimal), then the expected number of recombinants is R times the total number of phages. \n\nIn the first experiment, only four pluses on strain B's lawn. Assuming each bacterium has four plasmids, maybe the expectation is 4 * 4 = 16. But since the dilution is 1:10^7, the actual number is lower. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to fewer plasmids causing the lysogeny issue. The number of plasmids with the recombined mutation determines the outcome. If the recombination rate is high enough, more plasmids will show the effect, reducing the number of plasmids available.\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, four pluses are found on strain B's lawn, which presumably shows the lysogenic effect, while in the second dilution, four on strain K suggest the lysogenic phage isn't working against strain K's lysogen. Wait, no\u2014the second dilution is on strain K's lawn, which is the lysogenically affected strain. So the four pluses would mean the lysogenic phage (from strain B's population) was successful at killing strain K's lysogen.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage from strain B's population should kill strain K's lysogen. So why did the second dilution show four pluses on strain K's lawn? Maybe I got it wrong. Strain K is the lysogenically affected strain, so the lysogenic phage from strain B's population should lyse it. Therefore, the second dilution should have zero pluses on strain K's lawn if the lysogenic phage didn't work against them. But instead, it's showing four pluses, meaning the lysogenic phage actually killed them.\n\nThis seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants allows some phages to recombine, leading to some being active despite the presence of the lysogenic phage.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The expected number of successful recombination events determines the number of successful infections. For example, if the recombination rate is R, the number of successful infections would be proportional to R multiplied by the number of phages.\n\nLooking at the data: In the first dilution (1:10^7), four pluses on strain B's lawn. Since strain B is the lysogenic strain, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to lyse them unless there's recombination. So if some phages are recombining, they might still lyse strain B's lysogen. \n\nWait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it becomes a different phage. So in the first dilution, where only strain B is present, the lysogenic phage may recombine with its own copy or with others. But if the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse strain B's lysogen. However, if it recombines, it becomes a new phage that might lyse either strain B's lysogen or the strain K's lysogen.\n\nBut in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, but only four pluses on strain B's lawn. This suggests that the lysogenic phage was able to lyse strain B's lysogen. But in the second dilution, using strain K's lawn, four pluses indicate the lysogenic phage worked against strain K's lysogen.\n\nHmm, maybe the recombination affects the lysogenicity. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage can become non-lysogenic (lytic) again, which would lead to lytic fission and cell death upon replication.\n\nIf recombination happens, then the lysogenic phage can still lyse strain B's lysogen, but not strain K's. Or vice versa. But according to the results, in the first dilution, four pluses are on strain B's lawn, implying that the lysogenic phage caused strain B's lysogen to die. In the second dilution, four pluses on strain K's lawn, suggesting the lysogenic phage caused strain K's lysogen to die.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage must be capable of recombining with the host's lysogen. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could lyse both lysogens. But according to the data, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse strain K's lysogen in the second dilution, implying that recombination didn't occur. Because if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage could have recombined with strain K's lysogen and become non-lysogenic, allowing it to lyse strain K's lysogen.\n\nSo the absence of pluses on strain K's lawn indicates that recombination did not happen. Therefore, the recombination rate R must be low.\n\nNow, let's model this. The expected number of plasmids with recombined mutations that lyse both lysogens is proportional to R. The number of plasmids is determined by the dilution. Each dilution reduces the concentration of phages, making the probability of recombination lower.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the expected number of plasmids with recombination that lyse strain B is 4 * R. Since strain B's population is low, this might be close to 4R. But we observed four pluses, so perhaps 4R \u2248 4 \u2192 R\u22481.\n\nBut wait, the data says four pluses on strain B, which implies that the lysogenic phage caused their death. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could also lyse strain K's lysogen, but in reality, it didn't. So recombination must be rare.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the formula for expected recombination success. The number of successful recombination events (S) is approximately N * R, where N is the total number of phages. The probability of a phage having a recombined mutation is S/N. The expected number of plasmids with recombined mutations that lyse the target strain is proportional to R.\n\nIn the first dilution, the expected number of such plasmids is R * N_target / D, where N_target is the number of target plasmids per bacterium, and D is the dilution factor.\n\nAssuming each bacterium has 4 plasmids, and N_target is 4 (since each bacterium has 4 plasmids), then:\n\nExpected plasmids with recombination: R * 4 / D.\n\nFor the first dilution, D=1e7, so expected plasmids: (R*4)/1e7.\n\nWe observed four pluses, so set up equation: (R*4)/1e7 = 4 \u2192 R=1e7/1=1e7, which is impossible because R can't exceed 1.\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids with recombination is R * (total plasmids) * (probability of replication).\n\nEach bacterium has 4 plasmids, so total plasmids per bacterium is 4. The probability that a phage replicates without losing its plasmid is... Well, under dilution, the probability decreases as D increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the expected number of recombination events that lead to successful infection.\n\nThe expected number of successful recombination events is R * (number of possible recombination sites). In our case, each bacterium has 4 plasmids, so there are 4 possible recombination sites. Thus, total possible recombination sites is 4 * N_target.\n\nThe probability that a phage recombines at any site is R. Therefore, the expected number of successful recombination events is R * (4 * N_target).\n\nEach successful recombination event contributes to the probability of lysogeny. The expected number of plasmids with the recombined mutation that lyse the target strain is (R * 4 * N_target) / D.\n\nIn the first dilution, D=1e7, N_target=4, so expected plasmids with recombination: (R*4*4)/1e7 = (16R)/1e7.\n\nWe observed four pluses, so set (16R)/1e7 = 4 \u2192 R= (4 * 1e7)/16 = 2.5e6, which is way too high. Clearly, this approach isn't correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the probability of recombination occurring within the same plasmid. If recombination happens, the phage becomes non-lysogenic, so it can lyse any host. But in the first dilution, only strain B is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse B's lysogen if it recombines. In the second dilution, strain K is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse K's lysogen if it recombines.\n\nBut in reality, the lysogenic phage cannot recombine with itself; it must recombine with the host's lysogen. So if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage becomes non-lysogenic and can lyse either host's lysogen.\n\nHowever, in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, and only four pluses on strain B's lawn. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could lyse strain B's lysogen, leading to the observed plasmids. But in the second dilution, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse strain K's lysogen, implying that recombination didn't occur. Therefore, R must be low.\n\nTo find R, we can use the fact that the number of plasmids with recombination that lyse strain K is zero in the second dilution. Since recombination didn't happen, R=0. But that contradicts the initial observation.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage cannot recombine with itself. It must recombine with the host's lysogen. So in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B's lysogen if it recombines. In the second dilution, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain K's lysogen if it recombines. But in the second dilution, it didn't, so R must be zero. That can't be right because the lysogenic phage must have some ability to recombine.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The key is that recombination reduces the likelihood of lysogeny. If R is high, the lysogenic phage can lyse both lysogens. If R is low, it can only lyse one.\n\nIn the first dilution, only four pluses on strain B's lawn, indicating that the lysogenic phage caused B's lysogen to die. This suggests that recombination didn't occur, because if it had, the lysogenic phage could lyse B's lysogen regardless.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not necessarily true. If the lysogenic phage recombines with B's own plasmid, it becomes non-lysogenic and can lyse B's lysogen. If it recombines with its own host's lysogen, it remains lysogenic and can lyse the host's lysogen.\n\nBut in the first dilution, only B is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse B's lysogen if it recombines with B's plasmid. However, in the second dilution, B isn't present, so the lysogenic phage can't lyse B's lysogen anymore, but it can lyse K's lysogen if it recombines with K's plasmid.\n\nBut according to the results, in the first dilution, four pluses on B's lawn, and in the second dilution, four pluses on K's lawn. This suggests that recombination didn't occur, because if it did, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens.\n\nWait, that makes sense. If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens, leading to more plasmids being lost in both dilutions. But in reality, in the first dilution, it only lost four plasmids on B's lawn, and in the second dilution, it only lost four on K's lawn. This suggests that recombination didn't happen because otherwise, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens, and the numbers would have increased beyond four.\n\nTherefore, R must be low. To find R, we can calculate the ratio of plasmids with recombination that led to lysogeny.\n\nIn the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, and four plasmids were lost on B's lawn. Each bacterium has four plasmids, so the number of plasmids lost is 4. The expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (total plasmids) * (probability of replication).\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium is 4, and the probability of replication without losing a plasmid is decreasing as D increases. Under dilution, the probability of replication without loss is e^(-D), but perhaps we can approximate it as D.\n\nThus, expected plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (4) * D.\n\nIn the first dilution, D=1e7, and plasmids lost=4, so:\n\nR * 4 * 1e7 = 4 \u2192 R = 4 / (4e7) = 1e-7.\n\nThat's a very low recombination rate, but none of the options match exactly. However, looking at the answer choices, option F is 0.3%, which is roughly 3e-5. Our calculation gave R\u22481e-7, which is much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is slightly different. The expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (N_target) * D, where N_target is the number of plasmids per bacterium, and D is the dilution factor. Here, N_target=4, D=1e7.\n\nSet R * 4 * 1e7 = 4 \u2192 R=1e-7. Still the same result.\n\nBut the answer choices don't include 1e-7. The closest is F, which is 0.3%. Perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the formula assumes that all plasmids are equally likely to lose a copy during replication. So the probability of losing a plasmid during replication is p=1 - e^{-D}. For D=1e7, e^{-1e7} is practically zero, so p\u22481. That doesn't make sense because the probability shouldn't be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Poisson approximation for the number of plasmids lost due to recombination. The expected number of plasmids lost is \u03bb = R * (N_target) * D.\n\nHere, N_target=4, D=1e7, so \u03bb=R*4e7.\n\nFrom the first dilution, the expected plasmids lost is \u03bb=4 (plasmids lost on B's lawn). So:\n\nR * 4e7 = 4 \u2192 R=4/(4e7)=1e-7.\n\nSame result again. None of the answer options match this. The closest is F, 0.3%.\n\nMaybe the assumption that all plasmids are lost is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids with recombination is considered, rather than the number lost.\n\nWait, if the lysogenic phage recombines, it becomes non-lysogenic. The probability of recombination is R, so the number of successful recombination events is R * (number of possible sites) * (number of plasmids per bacterium).\n\nNumber of possible sites is 4 (each bacterium has 4 plasmids). Number of plasmids per bacterium is 4. So total possible recombination events is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nThe probability that a phage recombines at least once is approximately 1 - e^{-R}, assuming multiple sites. But for small R, e^{-R} \u2248 1 - R, so P= R.\n\nWait, no, the probability of at least one recombination is approximately R, since each site has independent probabilities.\n\nSo the expected number of successful recombination events is R * 16.\n\nEach successful recombination event leads to a plasmid that can lyse either lysogen. The probability that a plasmid is associated with K is 1/4 (since each bacterium has 4 plasmids, and K is one of them). Similarly, the probability that a plasmid is associated with B is 1/4. But since the lysogenic phage can't recombine with itself, it must recombine with the host's lysogen.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify. The expected number of plasmids with recombination that can lyse K is (R * 16) * (1/4) = 4R. Similarly, the expected number of plasmids with recombination that can lyse B is also 4R.\n\nIn the first dilution, we observed four plasmids on B's lawn. If recombination happened, those plasmids would lyse B's lysogen. But since we only saw four, perhaps the expected number is 4R = 4 \u2192 R=1. Impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the expected number of plasmids with",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they're both present, the cells divide into two equal halves\u2014one dilute at 1:10^7 and the other at 1:10^5. \n\nThen these plates are used on different bacterial strains\u2014strain B for the first dilution and strain K for the second. In the first case, there are four pluses on strain B's lawn, and in the second, four on strain K. \n\nWait, what do pluses mean here? They probably indicate successful infection, right? So if four pluses are found on strain B's lawn, each positive means four bacteria were successfully lysed. Similarly, four on strain K would be another four infections. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations in the phage's gene interact. If they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage won't affect the lysogenic lysogen anymore. But if they recombine, the lysogenic phage could now cause lysing. \n\nSo when both mutants are present, some might have recombined. If the recombination rate is high, more plasmids will show the effect. Let's think about the dilutions. The first dilution is 1:10^7, which is very low. That suggests that only a small fraction of the phage copies would cause an infection. The second dilution is 1:10^5, which is higher than the first, meaning more phages are present, increasing the chance of more infections.\n\nThe number of pluses depends on the probability of recombination. If the recombination rate is R (as a decimal), then the expected number of recombinants is R times the total number of phages. \n\nIn the first experiment, only four pluses on strain B's lawn. Assuming each bacterium has four plasmids, maybe the expectation is 4 * 4 = 16. But since the dilution is 1:10^7, the actual number is lower. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the presence of both mutants leads to fewer plasmids causing the lysogeny issue. The number of plasmids with the recombined mutation determines the outcome. If the recombination rate is high enough, more plasmids will show the effect, reducing the number of plasmids available.\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, four pluses are found on strain B's lawn, which presumably shows the lysogenic effect, while in the second dilution, four on strain K suggest the lysogenic phage isn't working against strain K's lysogen. Wait, no\u2014the second dilution is on strain K's lawn, which is the lysogenically affected strain. So the four pluses would mean the lysogenic phage (from strain B's population) was successful at killing strain K's lysogen.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage from strain B's population should kill strain K's lysogen. So why did the second dilution show four pluses on strain K's lawn? Maybe I got it wrong. Strain K is the lysogenically affected strain, so the lysogenic phage from strain B's population should lyse it. Therefore, the second dilution should have zero pluses on strain K's lawn if the lysogenic phage didn't work against them. But instead, it's showing four pluses, meaning the lysogenic phage actually killed them.\n\nThis seems contradictory. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of both mutants allows some phages to recombine, leading to some being active despite the presence of the lysogenic phage.\n\nLet me approach it differently. The expected number of successful recombination events determines the number of successful infections. For example, if the recombination rate is R, the number of successful infections would be proportional to R multiplied by the number of phages.\n\nLooking at the data: In the first dilution (1:10^7), four pluses on strain B's lawn. Since strain B is the lysogenic strain, the lysogenic phage shouldn't be able to lyse them unless there's recombination. So if some phages are recombining, they might still lyse strain B's lysogen. \n\nWait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage can recombine with the lysogen, it becomes a different phage. So in the first dilution, where only strain B is present, the lysogenic phage may recombine with its own copy or with others. But if the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse strain B's lysogen. However, if it recombines, it becomes a new phage that might lyse either strain B's lysogen or the strain K's lysogen.\n\nBut in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, but only four pluses on strain B's lawn. This suggests that the lysogenic phage was able to lyse strain B's lysogen. But in the second dilution, using strain K's lawn, four pluses indicate the lysogenic phage worked against strain K's lysogen.\n\nHmm, maybe the recombination affects the lysogenicity. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage can become non-lysogenic (lytic) again, which would lead to lytic fission and cell death upon replication.\n\nIf recombination happens, then the lysogenic phage can still lyse strain B's lysogen, but not strain K's. Or vice versa. But according to the results, in the first dilution, four pluses are on strain B's lawn, implying that the lysogenic phage caused strain B's lysogen to die. In the second dilution, four pluses on strain K's lawn, suggesting the lysogenic phage caused strain K's lysogen to die.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage must be capable of recombining with the host's lysogen. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could lyse both lysogens. But according to the data, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse strain K's lysogen in the second dilution, implying that recombination didn't occur. Because if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage could have recombined with strain K's lysogen and become non-lysogenic, allowing it to lyse strain K's lysogen.\n\nSo the absence of pluses on strain K's lawn indicates that recombination did not happen. Therefore, the recombination rate R must be low.\n\nNow, let's model this. The expected number of plasmids with recombined mutations that lyse both lysogens is proportional to R. The number of plasmids is determined by the dilution. Each dilution reduces the concentration of phages, making the probability of recombination lower.\n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the expected number of plasmids with recombination that lyse strain B is 4 * R. Since strain B's population is low, this might be close to 4R. But we observed four pluses, so perhaps 4R \u2248 4 \u2192 R\u22481.\n\nBut wait, the data says four pluses on strain B, which implies that the lysogenic phage caused their death. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could also lyse strain K's lysogen, but in reality, it didn't. So recombination must be rare.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the formula for expected recombination success. The number of successful recombination events (S) is approximately N * R, where N is the total number of phages. The probability of a phage having a recombined mutation is S/N. The expected number of plasmids with recombined mutations that lyse the target strain is proportional to R.\n\nIn the first dilution, the expected number of such plasmids is R * N_target / D, where N_target is the number of target plasmids per bacterium, and D is the dilution factor.\n\nAssuming each bacterium has 4 plasmids, and N_target is 4 (since each bacterium has 4 plasmids), then:\n\nExpected plasmids with recombination: R * 4 / D.\n\nFor the first dilution, D=1e7, so expected plasmids: (R*4)/1e7.\n\nWe observed four pluses, so set up equation: (R*4)/1e7 = 4 \u2192 R=1e7/1=1e7, which is impossible because R can't exceed 1.\n\nThat can't be right. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids with recombination is R * (total plasmids) * (probability of replication).\n\nEach bacterium has 4 plasmids, so total plasmids per bacterium is 4. The probability that a phage replicates without losing its plasmid is... Well, under dilution, the probability decreases as D increases.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the expected number of recombination events that lead to successful infection.\n\nThe expected number of successful recombination events is R * (number of possible recombination sites). In our case, each bacterium has 4 plasmids, so there are 4 possible recombination sites. Thus, total possible recombination sites is 4 * N_target.\n\nThe probability that a phage recombines at any site is R. Therefore, the expected number of successful recombination events is R * (4 * N_target).\n\nEach successful recombination event contributes to the probability of lysogeny. The expected number of plasmids with the recombined mutation that lyse the target strain is (R * 4 * N_target) / D.\n\nIn the first dilution, D=1e7, N_target=4, so expected plasmids with recombination: (R*4*4)/1e7 = (16R)/1e7.\n\nWe observed four pluses, so set (16R)/1e7 = 4 \u2192 R= (4 * 1e7)/16 = 2.5e6, which is way too high. Clearly, this approach isn't correct.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the probability of recombination occurring within the same plasmid. If recombination happens, the phage becomes non-lysogenic, so it can lyse any host. But in the first dilution, only strain B is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse B's lysogen if it recombines. In the second dilution, strain K is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse K's lysogen if it recombines.\n\nBut in reality, the lysogenic phage cannot recombine with itself; it must recombine with the host's lysogen. So if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage becomes non-lysogenic and can lyse either host's lysogen.\n\nHowever, in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, and only four pluses on strain B's lawn. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage could lyse strain B's lysogen, leading to the observed plasmids. But in the second dilution, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse strain K's lysogen, implying that recombination didn't occur. Therefore, R must be low.\n\nTo find R, we can use the fact that the number of plasmids with recombination that lyse strain K is zero in the second dilution. Since recombination didn't happen, R=0. But that contradicts the initial observation.\n\nWait, perhaps the lysogenic phage cannot recombine with itself. It must recombine with the host's lysogen. So in the first dilution, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain B's lysogen if it recombines. In the second dilution, the lysogenic phage can lyse strain K's lysogen if it recombines. But in the second dilution, it didn't, so R must be zero. That can't be right because the lysogenic phage must have some ability to recombine.\n\nI'm getting confused. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The key is that recombination reduces the likelihood of lysogeny. If R is high, the lysogenic phage can lyse both lysogens. If R is low, it can only lyse one.\n\nIn the first dilution, only four pluses on strain B's lawn, indicating that the lysogenic phage caused B's lysogen to die. This suggests that recombination didn't occur, because if it had, the lysogenic phage could lyse B's lysogen regardless.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not necessarily true. If the lysogenic phage recombines with B's own plasmid, it becomes non-lysogenic and can lyse B's lysogen. If it recombines with its own host's lysogen, it remains lysogenic and can lyse the host's lysogen.\n\nBut in the first dilution, only B is present, so the lysogenic phage can lyse B's lysogen if it recombines with B's plasmid. However, in the second dilution, B isn't present, so the lysogenic phage can't lyse B's lysogen anymore, but it can lyse K's lysogen if it recombines with K's plasmid.\n\nBut according to the results, in the first dilution, four pluses on B's lawn, and in the second dilution, four pluses on K's lawn. This suggests that recombination didn't occur, because if it did, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens.\n\nWait, that makes sense. If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens, leading to more plasmids being lost in both dilutions. But in reality, in the first dilution, it only lost four plasmids on B's lawn, and in the second dilution, it only lost four on K's lawn. This suggests that recombination didn't happen because otherwise, the lysogenic phage would have been able to lyse both lysogens, and the numbers would have increased beyond four.\n\nTherefore, R must be low. To find R, we can calculate the ratio of plasmids with recombination that led to lysogeny.\n\nIn the first dilution, the lysogenic phage caused division into two, and four plasmids were lost on B's lawn. Each bacterium has four plasmids, so the number of plasmids lost is 4. The expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (total plasmids) * (probability of replication).\n\nTotal plasmids per bacterium is 4, and the probability of replication without losing a plasmid is decreasing as D increases. Under dilution, the probability of replication without loss is e^(-D), but perhaps we can approximate it as D.\n\nThus, expected plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (4) * D.\n\nIn the first dilution, D=1e7, and plasmids lost=4, so:\n\nR * 4 * 1e7 = 4 \u2192 R = 4 / (4e7) = 1e-7.\n\nThat's a very low recombination rate, but none of the options match exactly. However, looking at the answer choices, option F is 0.3%, which is roughly 3e-5. Our calculation gave R\u22481e-7, which is much lower. So perhaps I made a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the formula is slightly different. The expected number of plasmids lost due to recombination is R * (N_target) * D, where N_target is the number of plasmids per bacterium, and D is the dilution factor. Here, N_target=4, D=1e7.\n\nSet R * 4 * 1e7 = 4 \u2192 R=1e-7. Still the same result.\n\nBut the answer choices don't include 1e-7. The closest is F, which is 0.3%. Perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, maybe the formula assumes that all plasmids are equally likely to lose a copy during replication. So the probability of losing a plasmid during replication is p=1 - e^{-D}. For D=1e7, e^{-1e7} is practically zero, so p\u22481. That doesn't make sense because the probability shouldn't be 1.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the Poisson approximation for the number of plasmids lost due to recombination. The expected number of plasmids lost is \u03bb = R * (N_target) * D.\n\nHere, N_target=4, D=1e7, so \u03bb=R*4e7.\n\nFrom the first dilution, the expected plasmids lost is \u03bb=4 (plasmids lost on B's lawn). So:\n\nR * 4e7 = 4 \u2192 R=4/(4e7)=1e-7.\n\nSame result again. None of the answer options match this. The closest is F, 0.3%.\n\nMaybe the assumption that all plasmids are lost is incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids with recombination is considered, rather than the number lost.\n\nWait, if the lysogenic phage recombines, it becomes non-lysogenic. The probability of recombination is R, so the number of successful recombination events is R * (number of possible sites) * (number of plasmids per bacterium).\n\nNumber of possible sites is 4 (each bacterium has 4 plasmids). Number of plasmids per bacterium is 4. So total possible recombination events is 4 * 4 = 16.\n\nThe probability that a phage recombines at least once is approximately 1 - e^{-R}, assuming multiple sites. But for small R, e^{-R} \u2248 1 - R, so P= R.\n\nWait, no, the probability of at least one recombination is approximately R, since each site has independent probabilities.\n\nSo the expected number of successful recombination events is R * 16.\n\nEach successful recombination event leads to a plasmid that can lyse either lysogen. The probability that a plasmid is associated with K is 1/4 (since each bacterium has 4 plasmids, and K is one of them). Similarly, the probability that a plasmid is associated with B is 1/4. But since the lysogenic phage can't recombine with itself, it must recombine with the host's lysogen.\n\nWait, this is getting complicated. Let me try to simplify. The expected number of plasmids with recombination that can lyse K is (R * 16) * (1/4) = 4R. Similarly, the expected number of plasmids with recombination that can lyse B is also 4R.\n\nIn the first dilution, we observed four plasmids on B's lawn. If recombination happened, those plasmids would lyse B's lysogen. But since we only saw four, perhaps the expected number is 4R = 4 \u2192 R=1.

After some time, the colonies are split into two halves: one half is dilute 1:10^7, and the other is dilute 1:10^5. One half is plated onto a lawn of strain B, and the other half is plated onto strain K. Then they count the number of pluses (colonies) in each. On K, there are four pluses, and on B, there are 40 pluses. \n\nWait, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In phages, especially when considering T_4 phages, the recombination rate would determine how often the two mutations occur together. If two mutations recombine, the resulting phage will express its genes differently than if they were independent.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the presence of plasmid DNA indicates whether the mutation was expressed independently or as a combination. Normally, without recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a higher chance of replicating because it might be more stable, leading to fewer plasmids being lost. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage might lose some of its plasmids over time due to incomplete replication, leading to lower numbers of plasmids. So, when you plate it on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation causing lysis, you get fewer plasmids, hence fewer pluses.\n\nSo, the ratio of plasmids after and before should reflect the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, fewer plasmids are present, leading to fewer pluses on strain K. Conversely, if recombination is low, more plasmids are retained, resulting in more pluses on strain K. \n\nLet me think about the expected ratios. Without any recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate more efficiently, retaining more plasmids. Therefore, on strain K, you'd expect more pluses than on strain B. However, in the experiment, strain K has fewer pluses (4 vs. 40 on B), indicating more plasmids on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B has lost more plasmids compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nBut wait, the experiment splits the colony into two halves. One half is plated on strain B (so same as original), and the other is plated on strain K. The count on K shows fewer pluses, meaning the lysogenic phage from strain B is less likely to retain plasmids, while the lysogenic phage from strain K retains more.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination rate = [(Number of plasmids on strain B - Number on strain K)/Initial plasmids] * 100%\n\nAssuming initial plasmids are similar for both strains, let\u2019s denote them as N. Suppose after treatment, strain B has N - x plasmids, and strain K has N + y plasmids. Wait, no, actually, strain B loses plasmids (due to recombination), so the lysogenic phage from B would have fewer plasmids than the original. While strain K retains more plasmids, so its lysogenic phage would have more plasmids.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. The ratio of pluses on K to B is 4/40 = 0.1. This ratio corresponds to the ratio of the average number of plasmids on each half. Since strain K has more plasmids on its half, the overall plasmid loss from strain B's half is significant.\n\nThe expectation under no recombination would be that the lysogenic phage from B would replicate better, so their plasmid load remains higher. But since they lost some, the ratio of plasmids on each half would decrease.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination rate:\n\nRecomb_rate = ( (average plasmids on K) / (average plasmids on B) ) - 1\n\nIf initially, both had N plasmids, then:\n\nAfter treatment, strain B has N - x (due to loss), and strain K has N + y (due to retention).\n\nThe ratio becomes (N + y)/(N - x) \u2248 0.1 (since 4/40=0.1)\n\nWe can assume that the losses are small, so x \u2248 y. Thus, (N + y)/(N - y) \u2248 0.1 \u2192 (1 + y/N)/(1 - y/N) \u2248 0.1 \u2192 approximately (1 + 0.1)(1 - 0.01) \u2248 1.1*0.99\u22481.089, which is close to 1.089. Hmm, maybe my assumption is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the expected plasmid loss. Under normal conditions (no recombination), the lysogenic phage would replicate perfectly, maintaining all plasmids. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose some plasmids over time, leading to a lower average plasmid load.\n\nThe observed ratio of pluses is 4 on K and 40 on B. So, the average plasmid load on K's half is 4/(number of pluses per plate?), but wait, each half is 1:10^7 or 1:10^5. The number of pluses depends on how many times the phage replicated successfully.\n\nActually, the key point is that the difference in the number of pluses reflects the difference in the efficiency of plasmid retention. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage from strain B (which carries the mutation) is less likely to retain plasmids compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nGiven that, the fraction of plasmids lost by the B phage's lysogen is greater than that of the K phage's lysogen. To estimate the recombination rate, we can model the expected number of plasmids after treatment.\n\nAssume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate perfectly, so the number of plasmids on each half would remain the same. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose some plasmids, leading to fewer plasmids on the B half and more on the K half.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the original plasmid load is P. After treatment:\n\n- For the B half: P - r*B\n- For the K half: P + r*K\n\nWhere r is the recombination rate (in terms of plasmid loss).\n\nThe ratio of pluses on K to B is given as 4/40 = 0.1, which implies that the average plasmid load on the K half is 0.1 times that on the B half.\n\nSo,\n\n(P + r*K) / (P - r*B) = 0.1\n\nAssuming that K and B are the same in terms of plasmid retention, say each has a 100% retention rate, then K = B = 1.\n\nThus,\n\n(P + r) / (P - r) = 0.1\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nP + r = 0.1*(P - r)\n\nExpand right side:\n\nP + r = 0.1P - 0.1r\n\nBring like terms together:\n\nP - 0.1P = -0.1r - r\n\n0.9P = -1.1r\n\nHmm, this gives negative r, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made an incorrect assumption. Perhaps K and B aren't 100% efficient, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way is to look at the ratio of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage from B has a lower average plasmid load, then the number of plasmids lost is higher relative to the total.\n\nThe observed plasmid loss would depend on the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, the lysogenic phage from B loses more plasmids, decreasing the average plasmid load, thus increasing the probability of losing plasmids when plated.\n\nSince the B half is plated first, and the count is higher (more pluses), it suggests that the lysogenic phage from B lost more plasmids, whereas the lysogenic phage from K retained more.\n\nGiven the ratio of pluses is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, indicating that the average plasmid load on the B half is 1/10th of the K half.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage from B has lost 9/10 of its potential plasmids, implying a high recombination rate. The exact percentage can be calculated based on the expected plasmid retention.\n\nUnder perfect recombination (no loss), the lysogenic phage from B would replicate and maintain all plasmids, so the ratio would be 1:1. With some loss, the ratio decreases. The observed ratio is 1/10, suggesting that the lysogenic phage from B lost 90% of its plasmids.\n\nThe expected plasmid loss can be modeled using the formula for the expected plasmid concentration after replication and loss. The loss rate r (in units of plasmid loss per generation) relates to the proportion of plasmids lost. Assuming exponential decay, the fraction remaining after time t is e^{-rt}. But since we're dealing with a ratio of two samples, maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, the fraction of plasmids lost can be approximated as ln(remaining plasmids)/ln(2). But I'm not sure. Another approach is to set up the equation:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original number of plasmids as P. After treatment, the lysogenic phage from B has P - L, where L is the loss. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K has P + M, where M is the gain (retention). The ratio is (P + M)/(P - L) = 0.1.\n\nAssuming that the loss and gain rates are proportional to the recombination rate, we can write:\n\nL = r * P\n\nM = r * P\n\nThen,\n\n(P + rP)/(P - rP) = 0.1\n\nFactor out P:\n\n(1 + r)/(1 - r) = 0.1\n\nSolve for r:\n\n1 + r = 0.1*(1 - r)\n\n1 + r = 0.1 - 0.1r\n\nBring terms together:\n\nr + 0.1r = 0.1 - 1\n\n1.1r = -0.9\n\nr = -0.9/1.1 \u2248 -0.818\n\nNegative rate doesn't make sense. So perhaps my assumptions are wrong. Maybe instead, the lysogenic phage from B loses some plasmids, reducing its average load, while the lysogenic phage from K gains some plasmids, increasing its average load.\n\nGiven that, the observed ratio is 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. So, the average plasmid load on K's half is 0.1 times that on B's half.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage from B lost some plasmids, and the lysogenic phage from K gained some, the equation would be:\n\nAverage_plasmids_K = 0.1 * Average_plasmids_B\n\nIf the original average plasmids were P for both, then:\n\n(Average_plasmids_B) = P - L\n\n(Average_plasmids_K) = P + G\n\nAnd,\n\n(P + G)/(P - L) = 0.1\n\nBut also, the loss rate L and gain rate G are related through the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, L is large and G is small.\n\nAssuming that L = k * P and G = m * P, where k and m are fractions representing the loss and gain rates respectively. The recombination rate r could be such that L = r * P and G = r * P, assuming equal loss and gain. But this might not hold exactly.\n\nFrom the ratio:\n\n(P + mP)/(P - kP) = 0.1\n\n(1 + m)/(1 - k) = 0.1\n\nAlso, considering that during replication, the average plasmid loss and gain are related to the recombination rate, perhaps k = m = r, but I'm not entirely certain.\n\nHowever, solving for k and m in terms of r seems complicated without additional information. Instead, let's make an approximation.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from B has lost enough plasmids to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th of K's, then the loss rate must be such that most of its plasmids are lost. \n\nAssuming that the loss rate r is very high, then:\n\n1 + m \u2248 0.1*(1 - k)\n\nBut without knowing either k or m, it's hard to solve directly. Alternatively, we can approximate that if the ratio is 10:1, the loss rate is such that the lysogenic phage from B has lost 90% of its plasmids. \n\nFor example, if a phage loses 90% of its plasmids, the average plasmid load would be 0.1 times the original. This happens when the loss rate r satisfies e^{-r} \u2248 0.1, so r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3. But this assumes exponential decay, which might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, a linear approximation: If the lysogenic phage from B loses x plasmids, and K gains y plasmids, then:\n\nx = y = r * P\n\nAnd,\n\n(P + y)/(P - x) = 0.1\n\nSubstituting x = y = rP,\n\n(P + rP)/(P - rP) = 0.1\n\nWhich leads back to the earlier equation:\n\n(1 + r)/(1 - r) = 0.1 \u2192 r \u2248 -0.818, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of a linear relationship between loss/gain and recombination rate might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is inversely related to the plasmid loss.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the expected number of plasmids lost is proportional to the recombination rate. Given that the ratio of pluses is 10:1, the expected loss would imply a high recombination rate.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest is F.0.3 percent, which is 0.3%, followed by H.5 percent, etc., down to J.05 percent. So, among these, 0.3% seems plausible for a high loss scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal relation: If the ratio is 10:1, the log base 10 of 10 is 1, which might correspond to a 1% recombination rate. But I'm not confident.\n\nWait, another thought: The expected number of plasmids lost would be proportional to the recombination rate. The ratio of pluses is 10:1, so the expected plasmid loss would cause the lysogenic phage from B to lose enough to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th. \n\nIf the loss rate is r, then the expected plasmid loss factor is e^{-r}, but if we approximate, e^{-r} \u2248 1 - r. So, 1 - r \u2248 0.1 \u2192 r \u2248 0.9, which would imply 90% loss. But none of the options go beyond 0.3%.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the ratio of pluses is 10:1, the expected number of plasmids lost would be high, requiring a high recombination rate. Among the options, 0.3% seems too low; maybe 0.05% or 0.1%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, H is 5%, and J is 0.05%.\n\nGiven that the observed ratio is quite significant (10:1), the recombination rate should be relatively high. If the expected plasmid loss is 90%, which isn't listed, but the closest option is F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. However, 0.3% seems low for 90% loss.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the expected number of plasmids lost would lead to a recombination rate where the loss is high. If the recombination rate is around 0.05%, then the expected plasmid loss would be small, but in our case, the plasmid loss is substantial.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the concept of the coefficient of coincidence. The coefficient of coincidence (COI) measures the correlation between the replication of two identical genes. It's used to detect double-stranded RNA interference by identifying multiple coincidences between the replication of two genes. \n\nThe COI is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (Observed frequency of co-occurrence) / (Expected frequency of co-occurrence)\n\nIn this context, the observed frequency would be the plasmid loss on the lysogenic phage from B compared to K. If the COI is high, it suggests strong positive correlation, which could indicate a high level of recombination.\n\nCalculating COI:\n\nCOI = (P_Loss_B) / (P_Loss_K)^2\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the COI can be estimated as:\n\nCOI = (P_Loss_B) / (P_Loss_K * P_Loss_K)\n\nAgain, without specific data, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the options provided, I'll infer that a high recombination rate leads to a significant difference in plasmid load between the two groups. Among the options, 0.3% (F) seems plausible for a moderate recombination rate, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, 0.05% (J) might be closer to the expected value if the plasmid loss is slightly higher.\n\nWait, another angle: The ratio of pluses is 4:40 = 1:10. Using the formula for expected plasmid loss, the expected number of plasmids lost would be such that the lysogenic phage from B has lost enough to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th. If the recombination rate is high, the loss would be significant.\n\nGiven that, the expected recombination rate would correspond to a loss that reduces the plasmid load by a factor of 10. If the expected plasmid loss is high, say 90%, but the closest option is F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. However, 0.3% seems low for 90% loss. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. Strain K isn't affected, so maybe it's using a different strategy or just doesn't have issues here.\n\nThe experiment involves a plate of strain B, which is infected by both types of mutantphages. After some time, the colonies are split into two halves: one half is dilute 1:10^7, and the other is dilute 1:10^5. One half is plated onto a lawn of strain B, and the other half is plated onto strain K. Then they count the number of pluses (colonies) in each. On K, there are four pluses, and on B, there are 40 pluses. \n\nWait, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In phages, especially when considering T_4 phages, the recombination rate would determine how often the two mutations occur together. If two mutations recombine, the resulting phage will express its genes differently than if they were independent.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the presence of plasmid DNA indicates whether the mutation was expressed independently or as a combination. Normally, without recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a higher chance of replicating because it might be more stable, leading to fewer plasmids being lost. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage might lose some of its plasmids over time due to incomplete replication, leading to lower numbers of plasmids. So, when you plate it on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation causing lysis, you get fewer plasmids, hence fewer pluses.\n\nSo, the ratio of plasmids after and before should reflect the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, fewer plasmids are present, leading to fewer pluses on strain K. Conversely, if recombination is low, more plasmids are retained, resulting in more pluses on strain K. \n\nLet me think about the expected ratios. Without any recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate more efficiently, retaining more plasmids. Therefore, on strain K, you'd expect more pluses than on strain B. However, in the experiment, strain K has fewer pluses (4 vs. 40 on B), indicating more plasmids on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B has lost more plasmids compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nBut wait, the experiment splits the colony into two halves. One half is plated on strain B (so same as original), and the other is plated on strain K. The count on K shows fewer pluses, meaning the lysogenic phage from strain B is less likely to retain plasmids, while the lysogenic phage from strain K retains more.\n\nTo calculate the recombination rate, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination rate = [(Number of plasmids on strain B - Number on strain K)/Initial plasmids] * 100%\n\nAssuming initial plasmids are similar for both strains, let\u2019s denote them as N. Suppose after treatment, strain B has N - x plasmids, and strain K has N + y plasmids. Wait, no, actually, strain B loses plasmids (due to recombination), so the lysogenic phage from B would have fewer plasmids than the original. While strain K retains more plasmids, so its lysogenic phage would have more plasmids.\n\nBut I'm getting confused. Let's approach it differently. The ratio of pluses on K to B is 4/40 = 0.1. This ratio corresponds to the ratio of the average number of plasmids on each half. Since strain K has more plasmids on its half, the overall plasmid loss from strain B's half is significant.\n\nThe expectation under no recombination would be that the lysogenic phage from B would replicate better, so their plasmid load remains higher. But since they lost some, the ratio of plasmids on each half would decrease.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination rate:\n\nRecomb_rate = ( (average plasmids on K) / (average plasmids on B) ) - 1\n\nIf initially, both had N plasmids, then:\n\nAfter treatment, strain B has N - x (due to loss), and strain K has N + y (due to retention).\n\nThe ratio becomes (N + y)/(N - x) \u2248 0.1 (since 4/40=0.1)\n\nWe can assume that the losses are small, so x \u2248 y. Thus, (N + y)/(N - y) \u2248 0.1 \u2192 (1 + y/N)/(1 - y/N) \u2248 0.1 \u2192 approximately (1 + 0.1)(1 - 0.01) \u2248 1.1*0.99\u22481.089, which is close to 1.089. Hmm, maybe my assumption is off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the expected plasmid loss. Under normal conditions (no recombination), the lysogenic phage would replicate perfectly, maintaining all plasmids. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose some plasmids over time, leading to a lower average plasmid load.\n\nThe observed ratio of pluses is 4 on K and 40 on B. So, the average plasmid load on K's half is 4/(number of pluses per plate?), but wait, each half is 1:10^7 or 1:10^5. The number of pluses depends on how many times the phage replicated successfully.\n\nActually, the key point is that the difference in the number of pluses reflects the difference in the efficiency of plasmid retention. The experiment shows that the lysogenic phage from strain B (which carries the mutation) is less likely to retain plasmids compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K.\n\nGiven that, the fraction of plasmids lost by the B phage's lysogen is greater than that of the K phage's lysogen. To estimate the recombination rate, we can model the expected number of plasmids after treatment.\n\nAssume that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate perfectly, so the number of plasmids on each half would remain the same. But with recombination, the lysogenic phage may lose some plasmids, leading to fewer plasmids on the B half and more on the K half.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that the original plasmid load is P. After treatment:\n\n- For the B half: P - r*B\n- For the K half: P + r*K\n\nWhere r is the recombination rate (in terms of plasmid loss).\n\nThe ratio of pluses on K to B is given as 4/40 = 0.1, which implies that the average plasmid load on the K half is 0.1 times that on the B half.\n\nSo,\n\n(P + r*K) / (P - r*B) = 0.1\n\nAssuming that K and B are the same in terms of plasmid retention, say each has a 100% retention rate, then K = B = 1.\n\nThus,\n\n(P + r) / (P - r) = 0.1\n\nMultiply both sides by denominator:\n\nP + r = 0.1*(P - r)\n\nExpand right side:\n\nP + r = 0.1P - 0.1r\n\nBring like terms together:\n\nP - 0.1P = -0.1r - r\n\n0.9P = -1.1r\n\nHmm, this gives negative r, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made an incorrect assumption. Perhaps K and B aren't 100% efficient, but that complicates things further.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way is to look at the ratio of plasmids. If the lysogenic phage from B has a lower average plasmid load, then the number of plasmids lost is higher relative to the total.\n\nThe observed plasmid loss would depend on the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, the lysogenic phage from B loses more plasmids, decreasing the average plasmid load, thus increasing the probability of losing plasmids when plated.\n\nSince the B half is plated first, and the count is higher (more pluses), it suggests that the lysogenic phage from B lost more plasmids, whereas the lysogenic phage from K retained more.\n\nGiven the ratio of pluses is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1, indicating that the average plasmid load on the B half is 1/10th of the K half.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage from B has lost 9/10 of its potential plasmids, implying a high recombination rate. The exact percentage can be calculated based on the expected plasmid retention.\n\nUnder perfect recombination (no loss), the lysogenic phage from B would replicate and maintain all plasmids, so the ratio would be 1:1. With some loss, the ratio decreases. The observed ratio is 1/10, suggesting that the lysogenic phage from B lost 90% of its plasmids.\n\nThe expected plasmid loss can be modeled using the formula for the expected plasmid concentration after replication and loss. The loss rate r (in units of plasmid loss per generation) relates to the proportion of plasmids lost. Assuming exponential decay, the fraction remaining after time t is e^{-rt}. But since we're dealing with a ratio of two samples, maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nAlternatively, the fraction of plasmids lost can be approximated as ln(remaining plasmids)/ln(2). But I'm not sure. Another approach is to set up the equation:\n\nLet\u2019s denote the original number of plasmids as P. After treatment, the lysogenic phage from B has P - L, where L is the loss. Similarly, the lysogenic phage from K has P + M, where M is the gain (retention). The ratio is (P + M)/(P - L) = 0.1.\n\nAssuming that the loss and gain rates are proportional to the recombination rate, we can write:\n\nL = r * P\n\nM = r * P\n\nThen,\n\n(P + rP)/(P - rP) = 0.1\n\nFactor out P:\n\n(1 + r)/(1 - r) = 0.1\n\nSolve for r:\n\n1 + r = 0.1*(1 - r)\n\n1 + r = 0.1 - 0.1r\n\nBring terms together:\n\nr + 0.1r = 0.1 - 1\n\n1.1r = -0.9\n\nr = -0.9/1.1 \u2248 -0.818\n\nNegative rate doesn't make sense. So perhaps my assumptions are wrong. Maybe instead, the lysogenic phage from B loses some plasmids, reducing its average load, while the lysogenic phage from K gains some plasmids, increasing its average load.\n\nGiven that, the observed ratio is 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. So, the average plasmid load on K's half is 0.1 times that on B's half.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage from B lost some plasmids, and the lysogenic phage from K gained some, the equation would be:\n\nAverage_plasmids_K = 0.1 * Average_plasmids_B\n\nIf the original average plasmids were P for both, then:\n\n(Average_plasmids_B) = P - L\n\n(Average_plasmids_K) = P + G\n\nAnd,\n\n(P + G)/(P - L) = 0.1\n\nBut also, the loss rate L and gain rate G are related through the recombination rate. If the recombination rate is high, L is large and G is small.\n\nAssuming that L = k * P and G = m * P, where k and m are fractions representing the loss and gain rates respectively. The recombination rate r could be such that L = r * P and G = r * P, assuming equal loss and gain. But this might not hold exactly.\n\nFrom the ratio:\n\n(P + mP)/(P - kP) = 0.1\n\n(1 + m)/(1 - k) = 0.1\n\nAlso, considering that during replication, the average plasmid loss and gain are related to the recombination rate, perhaps k = m = r, but I'm not entirely certain.\n\nHowever, solving for k and m in terms of r seems complicated without additional information. Instead, let's make an approximation.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from B has lost enough plasmids to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th of K's, then the loss rate must be such that most of its plasmids are lost. \n\nAssuming that the loss rate r is very high, then:\n\n1 + m \u2248 0.1*(1 - k)\n\nBut without knowing either k or m, it's hard to solve directly. Alternatively, we can approximate that if the ratio is 10:1, the loss rate is such that the lysogenic phage from B has lost 90% of its plasmids. \n\nFor example, if a phage loses 90% of its plasmids, the average plasmid load would be 0.1 times the original. This happens when the loss rate r satisfies e^{-r} \u2248 0.1, so r \u2248 ln(10) \u2248 2.3. But this assumes exponential decay, which might not apply here.\n\nAlternatively, a linear approximation: If the lysogenic phage from B loses x plasmids, and K gains y plasmids, then:\n\nx = y = r * P\n\nAnd,\n\n(P + y)/(P - x) = 0.1\n\nSubstituting x = y = rP,\n\n(P + rP)/(P - rP) = 0.1\n\nWhich leads back to the earlier equation:\n\n(1 + r)/(1 - r) = 0.1 \u2192 r \u2248 -0.818, which is impossible.\n\nThis suggests that the assumption of a linear relationship between loss/gain and recombination rate might not hold. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is inversely related to the plasmid loss.\n\nAnother approach is to realize that the expected number of plasmids lost is proportional to the recombination rate. Given that the ratio of pluses is 10:1, the expected loss would imply a high recombination rate.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the highest is F.0.3 percent, which is 0.3%, followed by H.5 percent, etc., down to J.05 percent. So, among these, 0.3% seems plausible for a high loss scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps using the reciprocal relation: If the ratio is 10:1, the log base 10 of 10 is 1, which might correspond to a 1% recombination rate.

The ratio of pluses is 10:1, so the expected plasmid loss would cause the lysogenic phage from B to lose enough to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th. \n\nIf the loss rate is r, then the expected plasmid loss factor is e^{-r}, but if we approximate, e^{-r} \u2248 1 - r. So, 1 - r \u2248 0.1 \u2192 r \u2248 0.9, which would imply 90% loss. But none of the options go beyond 0.3%.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the ratio of pluses is 10:1, the expected number of plasmids lost would be high, requiring a high recombination rate. Among the options, 0.3% seems too low; maybe 0.05% or 0.1%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, H is 5%, and J is 0.05%.\n\nGiven that the observed ratio is quite significant (10:1), the recombination rate should be relatively high.

If the COI is high, it suggests strong positive correlation, which could indicate a high level of recombination.\n\nCalculating COI:\n\nCOI = (P_Loss_B) / (P_Loss_K)^2\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the COI can be estimated as:\n\nCOI = (P_Loss_B) / (P_Loss_K * P_Loss_K)\n\nAgain, without specific data, this is speculative.\n\nGiven the time constraints and the options provided, I'll infer that a high recombination rate leads to a significant difference in plasmid load between the two groups. Among the options, 0.3% (F) seems plausible for a moderate recombination rate, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, 0.05% (J) might be closer to the expected value if the plasmid loss is slightly higher.\n\nWait, another angle: The ratio of pluses is 4:40 = 1:10. Using the formula for expected plasmid loss, the expected number of plasmids lost would be such that the lysogenic phage from B has lost enough to reduce the average plasmid load to 1/10th. If the recombination rate is high, the loss would be significant.\n\nGiven that, the expected recombination rate would correspond to a loss that reduces the plasmid load by a factor of 10. If the expected plasmid loss is high, say 90%, but the closest option is F.0.3%, which is 0.3%. However, 0.3% seems low for 90% loss. Therefore, perhaps the correct answer is",

Wait, no, the problem says that both mutant phages cause issues in strain B but not in strain K. Hmm, maybe strain K has some resistance or another mutation that allows the lysogenic phage to survive?\n\nWait, actually, looking back at the problem statement: \"The resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So half of the plate was treated with the lysogenic phage and half with the lytic phage. Then each group was dilated again and plated on their respective bacterial strains. The other half (with the lytic phage) was dilated 1:10^7 before being plated on strain K, while the other half (with lysogenic phage) was dilated 1:10^5 and then plated on strain B.\n\nIn the experiment, on strain B, there were four pluses (lytic phage), and on strain K, there were four pluses as well. Wait, the way it's written, \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. The other half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B.\" So half of the plates (from the lysogenic phage) were plated on strain B, expecting less effect since the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse them, but instead should kill them if they're lysogenic. Similarly, the other half (lytic phage) was plated on strain K, expecting lysogenic phages to lyse it, causing fewer pluses.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage did not cause issues in strain K, so perhaps the lysogenic phage is still active in some way, allowing it to replicate or something. Or maybe the other mutation in strain K somehow interacts with the lysogenic phage in a way that enhances its activity, leading to more plasmid replication despite the lytic event.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of the lysogenic phage in the lysogenically treated plates (strains B) caused the lysogenic phage to replicate more efficiently than expected, resulting in more plasmids. On the other hand, the lytic phage in the K plates (strains K) led to more plasmids replicating because the lysogenic phage can replicate even when the lysogenic state isn't maintained.\n\nSo, the number of plasmids per colony would depend on how much the lysogenic phage replicated. If the lysogenic phage is more effective at replicating in the absence of the lysogenic state, that could indicate positive interference or some kind of cross-antibody phenomenon where the phage can bind better to lysogenic DNA, making it easier for it to replicate.\n\nIn the first case, when the lysogenic phage is plated on strain B, we expect some plasmids because the lysogenic phage should cause lysis, so most colonies should have no or very few plasmids. However, if the lysogenic phage is replicating more due to positive interference, we'd see more plasmids on strain B. In the second case, when the lysogenic phage is plated on strain K, we don't expect any plasmids because the lysogenic phage shouldn't do anything. Instead, the lytic phage is causing more plasmid replication, possibly because the lysogenic phage is now overrepresented in the lysogenically plated plates.\n\nWait, but the problem says that on strain B, four pluses are found, and on strain K, four pluses are also found. That seems contradictory unless there's an error in my reasoning. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the results. Alternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage in the lysogenically treated plates leads to more plasmids being replicated because the lysogenic phage can now take advantage of the presence of the lysogenic DNA, which may lead to higher replication efficiency.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is more likely to replicate when it's present in the lysogenically treated plates, we might observe more plasmids on strain B. Conversely, on strain K, the lysogenic phage is present in the lysogenically treated plates, leading to increased replication, hence more plasmids, but since strain K doesn't have the lysogenic phage issue, why are they getting plasmids anyway? Maybe because the lysogenic phage is overrepresented, it starts to replicate even without the lysogenic state, leading to more plasmids than expected under normal conditions.\n\nWait, let me think differently. The experiment involves two treatments:\n\n1. Lysogenic phage + Dilution 1:1e7 + Strain B\n   - Expected: No plasmids, as lysogenic phage should lyse the bacteria.\n   - Observed: 4 pluses, meaning plasmids are present.\n\n2. Lysogenic phage + Dilution 1:1e5 + Strain K\n   - Expected: No plasmids, same as above.\n   - Observed: 4 pluses, indicating plasmids are present here too.\n\nHmm, but the problem states that the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues in strain K. Wait, no\u2014actually, the problem says that the lysogenic phage caused issues only in strain B, not in strain K. But according to the experiment, both lysogenic phage groups resulted in plasmids on their respective plates. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating more in the presence of the lysogenically treated plates, regardless of whether it should.\n\nThis phenomenon is known as positive interference, where the presence of the phage itself (or other DNA molecules) increases the likelihood of additional DNA replication. In this case, the lysogenic phage in the lysogenically treated plates is interacting with the existing lysogenically plasmid-containing DNA, enhancing its replication ability.\n\nNow, the goal is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the proportion of recombinant offspring that appear in a genetic cross. Here, the two mutations are in the same gene (T_4 phage), so recombination would imply that one mutation occurs before the other during replication.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Proportion of recombinant individuals)\n\nAssuming that the mutations occur in the same region, the expected recombination frequency depends on the number of independent crossover events. However, since the problem is about positive interference rather than crossovers, we might need a different approach.\n\nPositive interference can be quantified using the equation:\n\np = (Number of plasmids observed)/(Total plasmids expected)\n\nBut in this case, both lysogenic phage treatments (on B and K) resulted in plasmids. So, perhaps we can model the occurrence of plasmids based on the interaction between the two mutations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the probability that a plasmid carries both mutations, and q as the probability that a plasmid carries none. The total plasmids in each treatment would be influenced by these probabilities.\n\nIn the lysogenic phage treated on strain B (no lysogenic state):\n\nExpected plasmids = 0 (since lysogenic phage should lyse)\nObserved plasmids = 4\n\nBut due to positive interference, the actual plasmids formed are higher than expected under normal conditions.\n\nSimilarly, in the lysogenic phage treated on strain K (has lysogenic state):\n\nExpected plasmids = 0\nObserved plasmids = 4\n\nAgain, due to positive interference, the plasmids formed are higher than normal.\n\nHowever, if both treatments result in plasmids, it suggests that positive interference is occurring across both conditions, which complicates things. Perhaps the key is to consider the ratio of plasmids in each condition relative to what would be expected under normal circumstances.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the number of plasmids per colony in each condition. Since positive interference increases the likelihood of plasmid replication, the observed plasmids will be higher than expected.\n\nIf the two treatments (lytic vs. lysogenic) produce the same number of plasmids, it implies that the two mutations are tightly linked (recombinant), and the recombination frequency is high. If they are in different regions, the recombination frequency would be low.\n\nGiven that both lysogenic phages produced plasmids, it suggests that the two mutations are close together and that positive interference is significant enough to allow plasmid replication beyond what would normally occur.\n\nThe recombination frequency (RF) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nRF = [n!/(k!(n\u2212k)!)] * (1/2)^{2k}\n\nwhere n is the number of independent intervals between the two mutations, and k is the number of intervals that contain both mutations (recombinants).\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact distribution of mutations within the gene, it's challenging to apply this directly. Another method is to estimate the percentage of recombinant plasmids based on the observed plasmids in each treatment.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the expected number of plasmids without any interference would be zero. However, due to positive interference, some plasmids are formed. If the observed number of plasmids in the lysogenic phage-treated on strain B is 4, and assuming the expected number without interference would be x, then x plus some extra from interference equals 4.\n\nSimilarly, for the lysogenic phage-treated on strain K, we get 4 plasmids, which might be due to positive interference as well.\n\nBut without specific numbers, it's hard to compute RF directly. However, considering the options provided, which are all percentages (like 0.02%, etc.), it's likely that the recombination frequency is high, given the strong positive interference seen in both treatments.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest value is 5% (option G), followed by 2% (B), etc. Given that positive interference can lead to high recombination frequencies, especially if the mutations are tightly linked, the answer is likely to be around 5%.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is H. 5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Half the colonies are dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, what's a plus? In phage experiments, a plus indicates successful infection\u2014meaning the phage successfully integrated into the bacterial chromosome. So, if 40 pluses come up on B, that suggests most of the phages in that group are successfully integrating. Similarly, 4 pluses on K mean fewer successful integrations there.\n\nNow, the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to how much the two genes have been joined together. If there's no recombination, the mutations would be independent; if there's significant recombination, they might have swapped places.\n\nIn the context of phage genetics, the T_4 phage has a single integration site. When a phage integrates, it can either have the mutation from the lysogenic phage or the mutation from the lytic phage. Since these are mutually exclusive (a phage can't have both mutations), the presence of one mutation indicates the absence of the other.\n\nSo, let's think about the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is calculated as the proportion of recombinant offspring. Here, the recombination would occur if the phages have swapped their insertions. However, since the phages are from different lineages (lytic vs. lysogenic), their mutations don't interfere with each other once they integrate into the host genome.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're looking at whether the mutations are present or absent. If the mutations were linked (recombined), then in some strains, you'd see one mutation and others the other. But here, the phages themselves carry one mutation or none, depending on their type.\n\nActually, the key point is that the mutations are independent unless there's recombination. Since the phages are from different types, their mutations shouldn't interfere. Therefore, the presence of one mutation should indicate the absence of the other.\n\nLooking back at the experiment, the number of pluses on B is higher than on K. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage didn't affect B, so more phages successfully integrated into B. On K, fewer phages integrated, meaning less recombination occurred there.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination would imply that a phage from one lineage integrated and another from the other lineage did not, swapping their positions. However, since both types are present, and the mutations are in different phages, the chance of them recombining depends on the size of the phage population.\n\nAssuming the population is large enough, the expected recombination rate would be low. For instance, if the population is 10 million, the probability of recombination is low. Given that the plasmids were diluted and plated, the recombination rate is likely very low.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be minimal. The observed numbers here (4 on B and 40 on K) suggest that there was some recombination, but not enough to make a significant impact.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, the formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring)\n\nHere, total offspring would be 40 + 40 = 80 (assuming equal distribution across both groups). Wait, actually, it's 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. But perhaps the exact calculation isn't necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the majority of plasmids have recombined, but given the small numbers, maybe the recombination rate is low.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer should reflect a low recombination rate. Looking at the choices, option D is 0.05%, which seems plausible. Alternatively, C is 1.5%, which is also possible. Hmm, but without precise calculations, it's hard to choose between those.\n\nHowever, considering that the majority of phages (40 out of 80) integrated successfully on B and fewer (4 out of 44) on K, the recombination frequency is around 4/44 \u2248 9%, which is quite high. This contradicts my earlier thought that recombination would be low.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. Here, the two phages have different mutations, so if they recombine, the resulting phage would have both mutations. However, in reality, phages typically have one dominant mutation. So, if a phage from lysogenic integrates and a phage from lytic integrates, they could end up with different combinations.\n\nBut in the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more successful integration on strain B, implying that the lysogenic phages are causing issues. However, the recombination between the two mutations would determine how often the mutations appear together.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say 50%, then the mutations would appear together in half the cases. But given the data, the number of plasmids with both mutations might be fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is the percentage of plasmids that have both mutations. If the recombination occurs frequently, more plasmids would have both mutations. However, given the data, the majority of plasmids have recombined, leading to fewer plasmids without both mutations.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the recombination rate affects the likelihood of having both mutations. If recombination is frequent, the chances of both mutations appearing on the same phage decrease. Conversely, if recombination is rare, both mutations are more likely to coexist.\n\nGiven that, if the recombination rate is low (e.g., 0.02%), then the majority of plasmids would have both mutations. But the data shows that on K, only 4 plasmids have both mutations, while on B, 40 do. That suggests that recombination occurred slightly more often on B, which might indicate lower recombination overall.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If there's no recombination, the mutations would be independent, and the presence of one would indicate the absence of the other. \n\nSince the lysogenic phages didn't affect strain B, but affected strain K, and the recombination rate is low, the correct answer must reflect a low recombination rate. Among the options, C is 1.5% and D is 0.05%. Given that the experiment showed some recombination (4 on B and 4 on K), but the majority didn't recombine, perhaps the recombination rate is low but not extremely low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B, 2 percent, indicating moderate recombination. But I'm not entirely sure. Without precise calculations, it's challenging, but I'll go with C, 1.5%, assuming it reflects a low but noticeable recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

However, since the phages are from different lineages (lytic vs. lysogenic), their mutations don't interfere with each other once they integrate into the host genome.\n\nBut wait, in this case, we're looking at whether the mutations are present or absent. If the mutations were linked (recombined), then in some strains, you'd see one mutation and others the other. But here, the phages themselves carry one mutation or none, depending on their type.\n\nActually, the key point is that the mutations are independent unless there's recombination. Since the phages are from different types, their mutations shouldn't interfere. Therefore, the presence of one mutation should indicate the absence of the other.\n\nLooking back at the experiment, the number of pluses on B is higher than on K. That makes sense because the lysogenic phage didn't affect B, so more phages successfully integrated into B. On K, fewer phages integrated, meaning less recombination occurred there.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination would imply that a phage from one lineage integrated and another from the other lineage did not, swapping their positions. However, since both types are present, and the mutations are in different phages, the chance of them recombining depends on the size of the phage population.\n\nAssuming the population is large enough, the expected recombination rate would be low. For instance, if the population is 10 million, the probability of recombination is low. Given that the plasmids were diluted and plated, the recombination rate is likely very low.\n\nIf the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be minimal. The observed numbers here (4 on B and 40 on K) suggest that there was some recombination, but not enough to make a significant impact.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, the formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant offspring / Total number of offspring)\n\nHere, total offspring would be 40 + 40 = 80 (assuming equal distribution across both groups). Wait, actually, it's 40 on B and 4 on K, totaling 44. But perhaps the exact calculation isn't necessary here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the majority of plasmids have recombined, but given the small numbers, maybe the recombination rate is low.\n\nGiven the options provided, the correct answer should reflect a low recombination rate. Looking at the choices, option D is 0.05%, which seems plausible. Alternatively, C is 1.5%, which is also possible. Hmm, but without precise calculations, it's hard to choose between those.\n\nHowever, considering that the majority of phages (40 out of 80) integrated successfully on B and fewer (4 out of 44) on K, the recombination frequency is around 4/44 \u2248 9%, which is quite high. This contradicts my earlier thought that recombination would be low.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing things up. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. Here, the two phages have different mutations, so if they recombine, the resulting phage would have both mutations. However, in reality, phages typically have one dominant mutation. So, if a phage from lysogenic integrates and a phage from lytic integrates, they could end up with different combinations.\n\nBut in the experiment, the presence of lysogenic phages leads to more successful integration on strain B, implying that the lysogenic phages are causing issues. However, the recombination between the two mutations would determine how often the mutations appear together.\n\nIf the recombination frequency is high, say 50%, then the mutations would appear together in half the cases. But given the data, the number of plasmids with both mutations might be fewer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is the percentage of plasmids that have both mutations. If the recombination occurs frequently, more plasmids would have both mutations. However, given the data, the majority of plasmids have recombined, leading to fewer plasmids without both mutations.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider that the recombination rate affects the likelihood of having both mutations. If recombination is frequent, the chances of both mutations appearing on the same phage decrease. Conversely, if recombination is rare, both mutations are more likely to coexist.\n\nGiven that, if the recombination rate is low (e.g., 0.02%), then the majority of plasmids would have both mutations. But the data shows that on K, only 4 plasmids have both mutations, while on B, 40 do. That suggests that recombination occurred slightly more often on B, which might indicate lower recombination overall.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If there's no recombination, the mutations would be independent, and the presence of one would indicate the absence of the other. \n\nSince the lysogenic phages didn't affect strain B, but affected strain K, and the recombination rate is low, the correct answer must reflect a low recombination rate. Among the options, C is 1.5% and D is 0.05%. Given that the experiment showed some recombination (4 on B and 4 on K), but the majority didn't recombine, perhaps the recombination rate is low but not extremely low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is B, 2 percent, indicating moderate recombination. But I'm not entirely sure. Without precise calculations, it's challenging, but I'll go with C, 1.5%, assuming it reflects a low but noticeable recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Then, the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, four plaques are found on K and 40 on B. \n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations work together or separately. If they're recombinant, their effects combine; if not, their effects cancel out. Since only lysogenic phage affects strain B, any recombination would mean that lysogenic phages don't affect strain B anymore, which aligns with the first experiment where only half survived. \n\nSo, the key here is to determine how many of the lysogenic phages were actually causing issues for strain B. In the first dilution (1:10^7), about 1/100,000 phages should be lysogenic (assuming equal distribution). If none of them caused failure, then we wouldn't get any survivors beyond the initial 50%. But since there are 40 survivors on strain B, this suggests that some of the lysogenic phages were working. \n\nIn the second dilution (1:10^5), the number of lysogenic phages would be much higher, so more would have been affected. The presence of four plasmid-free colonies (which isn't possible because lysogenic phages carry the mutation) indicates that only a small fraction worked. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused. \n\nActually, when you dilute the phages, the chance of having a lysogenic phage is proportional to its frequency. If the recombination rate is low, fewer phages will have both mutations. So in the first dilution, the expected number surviving would depend on the proportion of phages carrying both mutations. If most were unaffected, the number of survivors would be around half. \n\nBut since 40 out of 100 colonies grew, that's a high rate. That suggests that a lot of the lysogenic phages are carrying the mutation, meaning the recombination is high. To find the exact percentage, I think the formula involves calculating the probability of recombination given the observed outcomes. \n\nLet me denote R as the recombination frequency. Each lysogenic phage carries either mutation A or mutation B, but not both. The recombination occurs when both mutations are present. The chance that a randomly selected lysogenic phage has both mutations is R. The survival rate without recombination would be zero (since lysogenic phages don't lyse cells), while with recombination, it depends on R. \n\nWait, no. Actually, in the first experiment, when the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse the cell. So if a lysogenic phage has both mutations, it still doesn't lyse, right? Because recombination usually refers to independent assortment. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. \n\nAlternatively, think about it this way: For a lysogenic phage to cause failure, it must carry both mutations. If R is the frequency of such phages, then during the first dilution, the number of colonies would be proportional to R. Since 40 out of 100 colonies survived, that implies R is 40%, but wait, that's too high. \n\nWait, let me correct. The number of surviving phages depends on how likely they are to carry both mutations. If R is the frequency of double mutants, then the survival rate would be proportional to R. However, in reality, since the first experiment shows that only half of the cells survived, implying R is low. \n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the expected survivors would be (number of phages with both mutations)/total phages * 50% (because only 50% survived). Similarly, in the second dilution (1:10^5), the survivors would be (R * total phages / 1e7) * 50%. \n\nGiven that in the first dilution, 50% survived, and in the second, 40% survived, we can set up equations:\n\nFirst dilution:\n( R / (1 - R) ) = 0.4\n\nSecond dilution:\n( R / (1 - R) ) = 0.4\n\nWait, no, because in the first dilution, the ratio of phages with both mutations to those without is what determines the survival. So if S is the survival rate, S = R / (1 - R). \n\nFrom the first dilution: S1 = 0.5 = R / (1 - R)\nSolving: R = 0.5/(1 + 0.5) = 1/3 \u2248 33.3%\n\nBut in the second dilution, S2 = 0.4 = R / (1 - R)\nSame equation gives R=1/3\u224833.3%, which contradicts the second data point. Hmm, maybe my approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of surviving phages is proportional to R, because each lysogenic phage with both mutations survives. So if R is the frequency, then the number of surviving phages is proportional to R. \n\nIf the first dilution had 1/10^7 phages, and 0.5 colonies survived, that means R = 0.5. But in the second dilution, with 1/10^5 phages, only 0.4 colonies survived, suggesting R=0.4. This inconsistency implies that the assumption might be wrong.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider the expected number of survivors. If the recombination frequency is R, then the expected number of surviving phages would be R multiplied by the number of phages in each dilution. \n\nIn the first dilution (n1=1e7):\nExpected survivors = n1 * R * 0.5\n\nGiven that 50% survived, so:\n0.5 = 0.5 * R \u2192 R=1\n\nBut that can't be right because R can't exceed 1.\n\nWait, I'm confusing the probabilities. Maybe it's better to use the concept of genetic interference. When two mutations are linked, their frequencies multiply. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The number of colonies after dilution follows a binomial distribution. In the first dilution, 50% survived, so the expected number is 0.5 * n1 * R, where R is the frequency. Setting this equal to 50% of n1*0.5?\n\nNo, that seems off. Let me try again. The survival rate without recombination is zero, so all phages with both mutations survive. Therefore, the number of survivors is proportional to R. \n\nIn the first dilution (n1=1e7), the number of surviving phages is R * n1 * 0.5 (since only half the phages are tested). Given that 50% survived, so R * n1 * 0.5 = 0.5 * n1 * 0.5 \u2192 R = 0.5\n\nSimilarly, in the second dilution (n2=1e5), the number of survivors is R * n2 * 0.5 = 0.4\n\nSubstituting R=0.5 into the second equation: 0.5 * 1e5 * 0.5 = 0.25e5 = 25,000. But the observed survivors were 40. That doesn't match. So my earlier conclusion that R=0.5 is incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I made an error in interpreting the numbers. Let me read the problem again.\n\nProblem states: \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So half of the cells died, meaning 50% survived. Then, half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\n\nAfter incubation, 40 plasmids on K and 4 on B.\n\nSo, in the first case, half of the cells (originally 100%) died, so 50% survived. Then, half of these 50% (25%) are further diluted 1:1e7 and plated on B's lawn. Of these 25%, 40% (10) survived. Similarly, the other half (25%) is diluted 1:1e5 and plated on K's lawn. Of these, 40% (10) survived.\n\nNow, the expectation is that if there was no recombination, the survival rate would be the same across different dilutions because the frequency of mutations would remain constant. But in reality, the survival rates differ, indicating recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nR = (p1 * q1) / (p2 * q2)\n\nWhere p1 and q1 are the allele frequencies in the first dilution, and p2 and q2 in the second.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are linked and recessive, p1 = p2 = R, and q1 = q2 = 1 - R.\n\nThus, R = (R * (1 - R)) / ((R * (1 - R))) ) = 1, which doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, another approach: The survival rate in the first dilution is S1 = R * (1 - R). In the second dilution, S2 = R^2. \n\nFrom the data:\nS1 = 0.5 (50% survived)\nS2 = 0.4 (40% survived)\n\nSo,\nR*(1-R) = 0.5 --> quadratic equation: R^2 - R + 0.5 = 0\n\nDiscriminant D = 1 - 2 = -1 </think>\nThe correct answer is D",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B.\n\nWait, what's a plume? It refers to colonies that form due to successful infection. So if the lysogenic phage (which causes problems) is present in both groups, how do we get different numbers?\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If both mutations are present, some cells might die because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse them. Others would survive. However, since the phages are mutant, their activity could be altered. Maybe some cells have more mutations, affecting their response.\n\nIn the first group, half the phages are lysogenic (causing issues) and the others are wild-type (safe). When plated on strain B, only the lysogenic ones cause death, while the wild-type ones don't. Similarly, the second group has a mix: some with mutation X (lysogenic) and some without (wild-type), but when plated on strain K, which doesn't have mutation X, all phages just replicate normally. \n\nBut wait, the problem says the plate is for E. coli strain B, so when the lysogenic phages are present (from the first group), they should lyse the cells, causing death. In the second group, the phages are either mutant X or wild-type. When these are plated on strain B, only the mutant X phages cause death because they're lysogenic, but when plated on strain K, which lacks mutant X, they just replicate normally. \n\nSo the outcome depends on whether the phage is mutant X or not. Let's look at the counts: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the majority of phages in each group caused death, meaning they must be mutant X. Because if only 4 out of 40 died on B, that means most of the phages in that group were mutant X. On K, none died, meaning all were wild-type or mutant Y (but since the lysogenic phage is mutant X, maybe there's another mutation, but the question is about recombination between X and Y).\n\nWait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So perhaps one mutation is X (lysozyme production) and the other is Y (lytic replication). The recombination frequency would indicate how often the alleles are mixed during gamete formation.\n\nIn the first group, when plated on strain B, only mutant X phages cause death. So the frequency of mutant X in this group determines the number of recombinants. Similarly, in the second group, when plated on strain K, mutant X phages don't cause death, indicating they're wild-type.\n\nIf the total number of plasmids is N, then the expected number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the crossover rate. But in this case, the numbers are 4 and 40. Let me consider that the total number of phages is equal in both groups. So the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that only 1% of the phages are mutant X in the first group and 10% in the second.\n\nRecombination frequency is typically given as the percentage of times the two alleles are mixed. So if 1% of phages are mutant X, the recombination frequency would be around 1%, assuming no interference and random segregation. That matches option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So both mutations are present in the same host.\n\nThe experiment involved splitting a population into two groups: one where half was dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, and the other half dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on strain B.\n\nWait, what's a plume? It refers to colonies that form due to successful infection. So if the lysogenic phage (which causes problems) is present in both groups, how do we get different numbers?\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If both mutations are present, some cells might die because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse them. Others would survive. However, since the phages are mutant, their activity could be altered. Maybe some cells have more mutations, affecting their response.\n\nIn the first group, half the phages are lysogenic (causing issues) and the others are wild-type (safe). When plated on strain B, only the lysogenic ones cause death, while the wild-type ones don't. Similarly, the second group has a mix: some with mutation X (lysogenic) and some without (wild-type), but when plated on strain K, which doesn't have mutation X, all phages just replicate normally. \n\nBut wait, the problem says the plate is for E. coli strain B, so when the lysogenic phages are present (from the first group), they should lyse the cells, causing death. In the second group, the phages are either mutant X or wild-type. When these are plated on strain B, only the mutant X phages cause death because they're lysogenic, but when plated on strain K, which lacks mutant X, they just replicate normally. \n\nSo the outcome depends on whether the phage is mutant X or not. Let's look at the counts: 4 plumes on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the majority of phages in each group caused death, meaning they must be mutant X. Because if only 4 out of 40 died on B, that means most of the phages in that group were mutant X. On K, none died, meaning all were wild-type or mutant Y (but since the lysogenic phage is mutant X, maybe there's another mutation, but the question is about recombination between X and Y).\n\nWait, the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So perhaps one mutation is X (lysozyme production) and the other is Y (lytic replication). The recombination frequency would indicate how often the alleles are mixed during gamete formation.\n\nIn the first group, when plated on strain B, only mutant X phages cause death. So the frequency of mutant X in this group determines the number of recombinants. Similarly, in the second group, when plated on strain K, mutant X phages don't cause death, indicating they're wild-type.\n\nIf the total number of plasmids is N, then the expected number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the crossover rate. But in this case, the numbers are 4 and 40. Let me consider that the total number of phages is equal in both groups. So the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. That suggests that only 1% of the phages are mutant X in the first group and 10% in the second.\n\nRecombination frequency is typically given as the percentage of times the two alleles are mixed. So if 1% of phages are mutant X, the recombination frequency would be around 1%, assuming no interference and random segregation. That matches option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Then these are plated on a lawn of strain B. On this lawn, 40 pluses show up.

Recombination refers to whether both mutations are present in the same phage. If a phage has both mutations, it will cause lysis regardless of the host; if only one mutation, it might or might not cause lysis depending on the host type.\n\nIn the first half (double dilution), half of the colonies were lysed. This suggests that the phage was causing lysis, meaning at least one mutation was present. When these are plated on strain B, most should be lysed, but 40% showed up. That seems low, maybe indicating some background activity or errors in counting.\n\nIn the second half (single dilution), only a small portion (4%) showed up, suggesting that the phage didn't cause lysis much here. Since the phage comes from strain B, it shouldn't have any lysogenic mutation, so why would it cause lysis? Maybe it's the presence of the lysogenic mutation in another phage. Wait, no\u2014the phage is from strain B, so it shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no. The phage comes from strain B, so it shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. Therefore, when plated on strain K, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the phage should not cause lysis. But in the experiment, 4 pluses appeared on strain K. That's confusing. Maybe the phage is actually from strain K?\n\nNo, wait. The phage is from strain B, as per the initial description. So how did it cause lysing on strain K? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nLet me try again. The phage is from strain B, carries mutations in region rII. These mutations cause it to lyse strain B cells but not strain K. When you plate half the colonies (with double dilution) on strain B, 40 pluses appear. When the other half (single dilution) is plated on strain K, 4 pluses appear. \n\nSo the double dilution shows that the phage is causing lysis on strain B. The single dilution shows that the phage isn't causing lysis on strain K. But since the phage is from strain B, it shouldn't have any lysogenic mutation. Unless... unless the phage somehow has a lysogenic mutation when it's being plated on strain K?\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense because the phage itself should come from strain B without lysogenic mutations. Maybe the double dilution includes some background activity or something else is happening.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the double dilution is showing that the phage is causing lysis in some of the cells, while the single dilution isn't showing much because the phage isn't compatible with strain K. But why then does the single dilution show 4 pluses?\n\nThis is a bit tricky. Maybe I should think about what recombination means. Recombination occurs when both mutations are present in the phage. If there's perfect recombination, every phage would cause lysis regardless of the host. If there's partial recombination, only some phages would cause lysis.\n\nGiven that the double dilution shows lysis in some cases (40%), and the single dilution shows lysis in fewer cases (4%), we can infer that some of the phages in the double dilution caused lysis, but none in the single dilution did. That suggests that the phages that caused lysis in the double dilution also don't cause lysis in the single dilution. Which could mean that those phages have the lysogenic mutation in addition to the wild-type, making them resistant to the lysogenic phage. Or perhaps vice versa.\n\nBut since the phage is from strain B, it shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. So maybe the phages that caused lysis in the double dilution are somehow compatible with strain K, but that doesn't seem right because strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation. Alternatively, perhaps the phage is not fully compatible with the host, but that's more about resistance than recombination.\n\nWait, maybe the problem lies in the way the double and single dilutions are set up. In the double dilution, the concentration is such that only half of the cells are lysed. That implies that the phage is causing lysis in some cells. When these are plated on strain K, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, the phage shouldn't cause lysis. However, in reality, the phage might still cause lysis because it's a different phage species. But that contradicts the initial description.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phage is actually from strain K, but the experiment is using double and single dilution plates. No, the phage is from strain B because the mutations are in region rII of the T_4 genome. So the phage must come from strain B.\n\nMaybe the issue is that the phages from strain B are not compatible with strain K, so they don't lyse the cells, but why would that happen? If the phage is from strain B, it should carry mutations that cause lysis in strain B but not K.\n\nWait, perhaps the double dilution shows that some phages are causing lysis, but the single dilution doesn't because the phage is incompatible with strain K. But that would imply that the phage isn't from strain B, which contradicts the given information.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The key point is that the phage is from strain B, carries mutations in rII, which cause it to lyse strain B cells but not K. The experiment involves double and single dilution plates. The double dilution shows that some cells are lysed, implying that some phages are causing lysis. The single dilution shows that even fewer cells are lysed when plated on strain K, which suggests that the phage doesn't cause lysis here. But since the phage is from strain B, it shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation, so why is it causing lysis on strain K?\n\nPerhaps the problem is in the interpretation of the data. Let me consider that the phage from strain B can sometimes cause lysis due to background activity or other factors, but when plated on strain K, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, it doesn't cause lysis. However, according to the data, 4 pluses are found on strain K, meaning 40% of the cells were lysed when plated on strain K. That's unexpected because the phage shouldn't cause lysis on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps the phage is actually from strain K, but that contradicts the given that the mutations are in region rII of T_4. So maybe the phage is from strain B, and the double and single dilutions are showing that the phage is causing lysis in some cells but not others. Specifically, in the double dilution, 40% are lysed, and in the single dilution, 4% are lysed.\n\nIf the phage is from strain B, it shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation, so it shouldn't cause lysis on strain K. But the experiment shows that 4% of the cells on strain K are lysed, which suggests that the phage isn't compatible with strain K. Wait, that makes sense! Because the phage is from strain B, it shouldn't be compatible with strain K, so it won't lyse their cells. But why does the double dilution show lysis?\n\nAh, perhaps the phage is partially compatible with strain K, but that's not relevant here. Alternatively, maybe the double dilution includes some background activity, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phage is actually from strain K, but that contradicts the given that the mutations are in region rII of T_4. So the phage must be from strain B.\n\nIn any case, the key point is to determine the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 phage. Recombination refers to having both mutations present in the phage. The higher the recombination, the less likely a phage will cause lysis, as it has both mutations.\n\nLooking back at the experiment: when the double dilution (which should have high recombination) is plated on strain B, 40% lyses. When the single dilution (which should have lower recombination) is plated on strain K, 4% lyes. So the double dilution has higher recombination, and the single has lower.\n\nThe expected number of plasmids would depend on the recombination rate. If recombination is high, each phage has both mutations and thus causes lysis. If recombination is low, each phage has only one mutation and doesn't cause lysis.\n\nIn the double dilution, 40% lyes, which is close to 0% recombination, meaning most phages cause lysis. In the single dilution, 4% lyes, which is consistent with high recombination, as only a few phages carry both mutations.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency (RF), we can use the formula:\n\nRF = (p * q) / n\n\nWhere p and q are allele frequencies, and n is the total population. But since we're dealing with plasmid numbers, perhaps we can model it differently.\n\nAlternatively, considering the plasmid load and the number of plasmids that cause lysis, we can estimate the RF. High plasmid density leads to high recombination, while low leads to low.\n\nIn our case, the double dilution (high plasmid density) shows that almost all phages cause lysis, suggesting low recombination (since only a few have both mutations). The single dilution (lower plasmid density) shows that only 4% cause lysis, which aligns with high recombination (most phages have both mutations).\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency between the two mutations is high. Looking at the options provided, 0.5 percent is option C. However, the answer choices are percentages, so we need to convert the recombination rate into a percentage.\n\nAssuming that the recombination rate corresponds directly to the plasmid load, a high RF would translate to a high percentage. Given the data, the correct RF is around 0.5%, which is option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So the first observation is that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K.\n\nNext, the bacteria is plated on their own lawn. Half the colonies die, then they're diluted 1:10^7 and plated again against strain B. Another half dies, and then they're diluted 1:10^5 and plated against strain K. In the end, four plates show four pluses on K and forty on B. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. Initially, half the colonies die, meaning each half has a 50% chance of being viable. After dilution, these colonies are plated again at different concentrations. Dilution 1:10^7 means the concentration is 1e-7 M, and 1:10^5 is 1e-5 M.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many times the mutation has occurred in the phages. If both mutations happened, we'd expect some plasmid contamination, leading to more plasmids than just the wild-type. However, since both mutants are present, some plasmids may have both mutations. The number of plasmids per bacterium determines whether they'll lyse or not.\n\nWhen the phages are plated against strain B, only those with lysogenic mutations survive because strain B doesn't lyse. Similarly, for strain K, only those with lysogenic mutations would survive, but wait, actually, in the initial experiment, the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission in strain B but not K. Wait, no\u2014strain K doesn't lyse, so lysogenic phages shouldn't affect it either. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysing, so it should not lyse strain B. But according to the problem statement, the lysogenic phage does lyse strain B but not strain K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing lysogeny but not replication? Or maybe it's causing lysogeny without causing lysis. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage causes replication but not lysis, while the other mutation leads to lysis. Wait, but if the lysogenic phage can replicate, then any mutation would lead to replication issues. Maybe the lysogenic phage can replicate but not cause lysis, and the other mutation allows replication but causes lysis.\n\nBut regardless, the main point is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. Since we have two mutants, one causing lysogeny and the other causing replication, but not necessarily lysis. Wait, but in the experiment, the lysogenic phage caused lysing in strain B but not in K, implying that the lysogenic phage somehow causes lysogeny but doesn't lyse the cell, whereas the other mutation doesn't do anything. Or maybe the lysogenic phage can replicate but not cause lysis, and another mutation prevents replication.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of plasmid loss. If both mutations occurred in the same plasmid, the phage wouldn't replicate much, leading to fewer plasmids. Alternatively, if one mutation occurred and the other didn't, there could be partial plasmid loss.\n\nIn the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage must have lysogeny but not replication. So when it replicates, it can cause lysis. Therefore, the lysogenic phage can replicate and cause lysis.\n\nNow, when these phages are plated against strain B and K:\n\n- Strain B: Only the lysogenic phage affected them, which suggests that the lysogenic phage had lysogeny.\n- Strain K: No effect because the lysogenic phage doesn't affect them.\n\nSo when the lysogenic phage is plated against strain K, it shouldn't lyse them. But in the results, four plates were positive on K and forty on B.\n\nAfter dilution, the number of surviving plasmids depends on the number of plasmids per bacterium. Suppose each bacterium has N copies of the T_4 phage. When plated into a lawn, the probability of a plasmid being lost is proportional to the number of plasmids per cell.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, each phage would lose some plasmids, increasing the likelihood of losing all plasmids. Conversely, if only one mutation occurred, there would be some plasmids remaining, leading to some survival.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K, perhaps it was due to the presence of a single mutation in the lysogenic phage. If both mutations occurred, the lysogenic phage would lose both plasmids upon replication, making it less likely to replicate and lyse.\n\nLooking at the results: in the first plate, half the colonies died, then another half were plated at a lower concentration. The number of plasmids per bacterium is N = total plasmids / N_bacteria.\n\nAssuming N is the same for all, when plated at 1e-7 M, the probability of a plasmid being lost is p = (N - n)/N, where n is the number of plasmids lost. If both mutations occurred, then each plasmid loses two plasmids during replication, so n = 2N, thus p = (N - 2N)/N = -1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother approach: if a single mutation occurs in the lysogenic phage, then the probability of a plasmid being lost is q = (N - m)/N, where m is the number of plasmids lost. For one mutation, m=1, so q=(N-1)/N \u2248 1 - 1/N. For two mutations, m=2, q\u22481 - 2/N.\n\nWhen plating at 1e-7 M, the expected number of plasmids lost per cell is \u03bb = q * V, where V is the volume. Here, V is 1e-7 L.\n\n\u03bb = q * V = (1 - 2/N) * 1e-7.\n\nIf N is large, say 1e6, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 per cell.\n\nIf N is small, like 1e5, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-9.\n\nDepending on the value of N, the number of plasmids lost varies.\n\nBut in the experiment, after dilution, the number of surviving plasmids is proportional to (1 - \u03bb).\n\nNow, considering the initial death rate: half the colonies died initially, suggesting that each colony had a 50% chance of containing a plasmid. Then, after dilution, some plasmids remained, allowing some survivors.\n\nThe number of plasmids per colony after dilution is N_diluted = N_initial / (N_initial + V), assuming dilution happens in the same way as in the experiment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the number of plasmids lost per cell: \u03bb = (number of plasmids lost)/(number of plasmids carried).\n\nIf a single mutation occurs, the probability of losing one plasmid is approximately 1/N, so \u03bb \u2248 1e-6.\n\nPlated at 1e-7 M, the volume is 1e-7 L. So \u03bb = (1/N) * 1e-7.\n\nIf N is 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 1e-13, which is negligible. So most plasmids remain.\n\nIf N is smaller, say 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 1e-12, still very low.\n\nIf N is around 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 1e-13.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of surviving plasmids after dilution is such that some colonies survive. So, for example, if N is 1e6, and \u03bb \u2248 1e-6, then the probability of surviving is e^{-\u03bb} \u2248 1 - \u03bb.\n\nThus, the number of surviving plasmids per cell is roughly 1 - \u03bb.\n\nSimilarly, if N is 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 1e-11, so survival probability \u2248 1 - \u03bb.\n\nNow, returning to the problem: after dilution, the phages are plated twice with different concentrations.\n\nFirst plate: 1:1e7, so V = 1e-7 L.\n\nSecond plate: 1:1e5, so V = 1e-5 L.\n\nThe number of surviving plasmids depends on the number lost during replication.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, then each plasmid loses two plasmids during replication, so the expected number lost per cell is \u03bb = 2*(N_initial / (N_initial + V)) * V.\n\nIf N_initial >> V, then \u03bb \u2248 2*N_initial * V / N_initial = 2V.\n\nWait, but if V is 1e-7 L, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-7.\n\nFor N_initial = 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 * 1e6 = 2e-1, which is 0.2. So survival probability is ~80%.\n\nFor N_initial = 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 * 1e5 = 0.02, so survival probability ~98%.\n\nIn the experiment, after dilution, the number of surviving plasmids is what matters. The number of survivors depends on the number of plasmids lost.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is plated against strain B, it affects only those with one mutation. So, after dilution, some of those plasmids survive enough to allow the phage to replicate and lyse.\n\nBut since strain B doesn't lyse, why did some of the phages die? Wait, no\u2014the initial experiment shows that in the first plate, half the colonies died, then they were plated again at 1e-7 M and another time at 1e-5 M. So perhaps the initial death is due to some plasmids being lost, and then further dilution restores some plasmids, allowing the phage to replicate and lyse.\n\nTherefore, the number of plasmids lost depends on the number of cells and the probability of losing a plasmid.\n\nIf N_initial = 1e6, and V = 1e-7 L, then \u03bb = 2e-7.\n\nSurvival probability is e^{-\u03bb} \u2248 1 - 2e-7 \u2248 0.9999998.\n\nWhich means almost all plasmids survive, so the phage can replicate and lyse.\n\nHowever, if N_initial is smaller, say 1e5, then \u03bb = 2e-9, so survival probability \u2248 0.99999998.\n\nStill almost certain.\n\nBut in the second plate, they're plated at 1e-5 M, which is higher dilution. This means less volume, so more plasmids lost. If N_initial is 1e5, then \u03bb = 2e-7, so survival probability \u2248 0.9998.\n\nIf N_initial is larger, say 1e6, then \u03bb = 2e-7 * 1e6 / 1e6 = 2e-7, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the key is to determine the number of plasmids lost in each case.\n\nFrom the data, after dilution, four plasmids survived in the first plate, and forty in the second.\n\nWait, but the initial number is half the bacteria. So if half the colonies died, meaning each of the remaining half has plasmids. So after dilution, each of the surviving half has a certain number of plasmids.\n\nSuppose after dilution, each surviving colony has X plasmids.\n\nThen, when plated at 1:1e7, the number of plasmids lost is \u03bb = X * V, where V is 1e-7 L.\n\nSimilarly, when plated at 1:1e5, \u03bb' = X * 1e-5 L.\n\nThe number of survivors is e^{-\u03bb}, and similarly for e^{-\u03bb'}.\n\nIn the first plate, four plasmids survived, and in the second, forty.\n\nAssuming each surviving colony had the same number of plasmids, then:\n\nFor first plate: e^{-\u03bb} = 4/total_colony_count.\n\nFor second plate: e^{-\u03bb'} = 40/total_colony_count.\n\nAssuming total_colony_count is the same for both plates, we can compare the exponents.\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-\u03bb = ln(4/N)\n-\u03bb' = ln(40/N)\n\nSubtracting:\n\n-\u03bb' + \u03bb = ln(40) - ln(4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nSince \u03bb = X * 1e-7 and \u03bb' = X * 1e-5,\n\nX * 1e-5 - X * 1e-7 = X * 9e-6 = 2.3026\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = 2.3026 / 9e-6 \u2248 255,844\n\nSo each surviving colony had approximately 255,844 plasmids.\n\nWait, that seems high. Typically, each E. coli has about 1e6 plasmids. So 255k is possible, but unlikely. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps each surviving colony had N plasmids, and the number of survivors is proportional to (1 - \u03bb)^N.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently. Let\u2019s denote N as the number of plasmids per cell. The probability that a single plasmid survives replication is p = 1 - \u03bb, where \u03bb is the fraction lost.\n\nIf N is the number of plasmids, then the probability of having zero plasmids is (1 - \u03bb)^N.\n\nBut in the experiment, some cells have zero plasmids, others have one, etc., depending on the mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids lost per cell is significant. If each phage loses two plasmids upon replication, then N_initial = number of plasmids per cell.\n\nAfter replication, the number of plasmids lost is 2*number of plasmids lost during replication.\n\nThe number of plasmids lost during replication is given by \u03bb = (number of plasmids lost) / (number of plasmids carried). Assuming \u03bb is small, we can approximate the number of plasmids lost as N * \u03bb.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, each plasmid loses two plasmids, so the number lost is 2N * \u03bb.\n\nBut the number lost must be an integer, so we round up.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plasmids lost per cell.\n\nIf the probability of losing a plasmid is p, then the expected number lost is Np.\n\nEach plasmid lost reduces the number of plasmids available for replication.\n\nThe number of plasmids remaining is N * e^{-Np}.\n\nBut in our case, some cells have lost all plasmids, so e^{-Np} = 0.\n\nBut in reality, it's probabilistic. So the number of survivors is N * e^{-Np}.\n\nBut in the experiment, the number of survivors is fixed. So perhaps we can set up equations based on the observed numbers.\n\nLet\u2019s denote S1 as the number of survivors after first dilution, and S2 after second dilution.\n\nWe have:\n\nS1 = N * e^{-Np}\nS2 = N * e^{-Np'}\n\nWhere p = \u03bb1 and p' = \u03bb2.\n\nWe know that S1 = 4 and S2 = 40.\n\nAssuming N is the same for both dilutions, we can take the ratio:\n\nS2/S1 = e^{-(N(p' - p))}\n\nTaking logarithms:\n\nln(S2/S1) = -N(p' - p)\n\nWe need to find N and p'.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's tricky. However, from the options provided, we can estimate the amount of recombination.\n\nRecombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. If the two mutations are linked on the same T4 chromosome, recombination would reduce the likelihood of double recombination events, thereby reducing the overall efficiency of recombination.\n\nIn our case, if both mutations occurred in the same plasmid, the probability of recombination would increase, leading to more efficient recombination events. Conversely, if the mutations are on separate chromosomes, recombination would decrease the efficiency.\n\nThe problem states that when the lysogenic phage is plated against strain B, only the lysogenic mutation affects it. This implies that the lysogenic phage can replicate but does not cause lysis. Whereas, when the lysogenic phage is plated against strain K, which doesn't lyse, there's no issue.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage cannot replicate without causing lysis in strain B but does not do so in strain K. Therefore, the lysogenic phage can replicate but only via lysis in strain B. Hence, the lysogenic phage must contain a mutation that allows replication and causes lysis.\n\nWait, but in the problem statement, the lysogenic phage does not cause lysis in strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage does not replicate without causing lysis in strain K. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that prevents replication in strain K but allows replication in strain B.\n\nWait, that's confusing. Let me think again.\n\nStrain B: lysogenic phage \u2192 lyse, so mutation must allow replication and cause lysis.\n\nStrain K: lysogenic phage \u2192 does not lyse, so mutation must prevent replication without causing lysis.\n\nAh, so the lysogenic phage has a mutation that stops it from replicating in strain K but allows it to replicate and cause lysis in strain B.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that disrupts replication, preventing the phage from replicating in strain K but allowing it to replicate and lyse in strain B.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage has two mutations: one that allows replication and lysis in strain B, and another that prevents replication in strain K.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"mutations\" occur in the T4 genome, so possibly, the lysogenic phage can replicate without causing lysis (mutation) and the lysogenic phage can cause lysis (another mutation).\n\nWait, no, the problem says the lysogenic phage does not lyse strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage can't replicate without causing lysis in strain K. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that stops replication in strain K but allows replication and lysis in strain B.\n\nSo the lysogenic phage has a mutation",

Problem: T_4phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII cancause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK. A plate of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultinglysateis divided inhalf. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strainB. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, which doesn't lyse cells, there's no issue. So the first observation is that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K.\n\nNext, the bacteria is plated on their own lawn. Half the colonies die, then they're diluted 1:10^7 and plated again against strain B. Another half dies, and then they're diluted 1:10^5 and plated against strain K. In the end, four plates show four pluses on K and forty on B. \n\nLet me break this down step by step. Initially, half the colonies die, meaning each half has a 50% chance of being viable. After dilution, these colonies are plated again at different concentrations. Dilution 1:10^7 means the concentration is 1e-7 M, and 1:10^5 is 1e-5 M.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how many times the mutation has occurred in the phages. If both mutations happened, we'd expect some plasmid contamination, leading to more plasmids than just the wild-type. However, since both mutants are present, some plasmids may have both mutations. The number of plasmids per bacterium determines whether they'll lyse or not.\n\nWhen the phages are plated against strain B, only those with lysogenic mutations survive because strain B doesn't lyse. Similarly, for strain K, only those with lysogenic mutations would survive, but wait, actually, in the initial experiment, the lysogenic phage caused lytic fission in strain B but not K. Wait, no\u2014strain K doesn't lyse, so lysogenic phages shouldn't affect it either. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify: the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysing, so it should not lyse strain B. But according to the problem statement, the lysogenic phage does lyse strain B but not strain K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage is causing lysogeny but not replication? Or maybe it's causing lysogeny without causing lysis. That might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage causes replication but not lysis, while the other mutation leads to lysis. Wait, but if the lysogenic phage can replicate, then any mutation would lead to replication issues. Maybe the lysogenic phage can replicate but not cause lysis, and the other mutation allows replication but causes lysis.\n\nBut regardless, the main point is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. Since we have two mutants, one causing lysogeny and the other causing replication, but not necessarily lysis. Wait, but in the experiment, the lysogenic phage caused lysing in strain B but not in K, implying that the lysogenic phage somehow causes lysogeny but doesn't lyse the cell, whereas the other mutation doesn't do anything. Or maybe the lysogenic phage can replicate but not cause lysis, and another mutation prevents replication.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of plasmid loss. If both mutations occurred in the same plasmid, the phage wouldn't replicate much, leading to fewer plasmids. Alternatively, if one mutation occurred and the other didn't, there could be partial plasmid loss.\n\nIn the first experiment, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phage must have lysogeny but not replication. So when it replicates, it can cause lysis. Therefore, the lysogenic phage can replicate and cause lysis.\n\nNow, when these phages are plated against strain B and K:\n\n- Strain B: Only the lysogenic phage affected them, which suggests that the lysogenic phage had lysogeny.\n- Strain K: No effect because the lysogenic phage doesn't affect them.\n\nSo when the lysogenic phage is plated against strain K, it shouldn't lyse them. But in the results, four plates were positive on K and forty on B.\n\nAfter dilution, the number of surviving plasmids depends on the number of plasmids per bacterium. Suppose each bacterium has N copies of the T_4 phage. When plated into a lawn, the probability of a plasmid being lost is proportional to the number of plasmids per cell.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, each phage would lose some plasmids, increasing the likelihood of losing all plasmids. Conversely, if only one mutation occurred, there would be some plasmids remaining, leading to some survival.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K, perhaps it was due to the presence of a single mutation in the lysogenic phage. If both mutations occurred, the lysogenic phage would lose both plasmids upon replication, making it less likely to replicate and lyse.\n\nLooking at the results: in the first plate, half the colonies died, then another half were plated at a lower concentration. The number of plasmids per bacterium is N = total plasmids / N_bacteria.\n\nAssuming N is the same for all, when plated at 1e-7 M, the probability of a plasmid being lost is p = (N - n)/N, where n is the number of plasmids lost. If both mutations occurred, then each plasmid loses two plasmids during replication, so n = 2N, thus p = (N - 2N)/N = -1, which doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nAnother approach: if a single mutation occurs in the lysogenic phage, then the probability of a plasmid being lost is q = (N - m)/N, where m is the number of plasmids lost. For one mutation, m=1, so q=(N-1)/N \u2248 1 - 1/N. For two mutations, m=2, q\u22481 - 2/N.\n\nWhen plating at 1e-7 M, the expected number of plasmids lost per cell is \u03bb = q * V, where V is the volume. Here, V is 1e-7 L.\n\n\u03bb = q * V = (1 - 2/N) * 1e-7.\n\nIf N is large, say 1e6, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 per cell.\n\nIf N is small, like 1e5, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-9.\n\nDepending on the value of N, the number of plasmids lost varies.\n\nBut in the experiment, after dilution, the number of surviving plasmids is proportional to (1 - \u03bb).\n\nNow, considering the initial death rate: half the colonies died initially, suggesting that each colony had a 50% chance of containing a plasmid. Then, after dilution, some plasmids remained, allowing some survivors.\n\nThe number of plasmids per colony after dilution is N_diluted = N_initial / (N_initial + V), assuming dilution happens in the same way as in the experiment.\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to use the formula for the number of plasmids lost per cell: \u03bb = (number of plasmids lost)/(number of plasmids carried).\n\nIf a single mutation occurs, the probability of losing one plasmid is approximately 1/N, so \u03bb \u2248 1e-6.\n\nPlated at 1e-7 M, the volume is 1e-7 L. So \u03bb = (1/N) * 1e-7.\n\nIf N is 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 1e-13, which is negligible. So most plasmids remain.\n\nIf N is smaller, say 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 1e-12, still very low.\n\nIf N is around 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 1e-13.\n\nWait, but in our case, the number of surviving plasmids after dilution is such that some colonies survive. So, for example, if N is 1e6, and \u03bb \u2248 1e-6, then the probability of surviving is e^{-\u03bb} \u2248 1 - \u03bb.\n\nThus, the number of surviving plasmids per cell is roughly 1 - \u03bb.\n\nSimilarly, if N is 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 1e-11, so survival probability \u2248 1 - \u03bb.\n\nNow, returning to the problem: after dilution, the phages are plated twice with different concentrations.\n\nFirst plate: 1:1e7, so V = 1e-7 L.\n\nSecond plate: 1:1e5, so V = 1e-5 L.\n\nThe number of surviving plasmids depends on the number lost during replication.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, then each plasmid loses two plasmids during replication, so the expected number lost per cell is \u03bb = 2*(N_initial / (N_initial + V)) * V.\n\nIf N_initial >> V, then \u03bb \u2248 2*N_initial * V / N_initial = 2V.\n\nWait, but if V is 1e-7 L, then \u03bb \u2248 2e-7.\n\nFor N_initial = 1e6, \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 * 1e6 = 2e-1, which is 0.2. So survival probability is ~80%.\n\nFor N_initial = 1e5, \u03bb \u2248 2e-7 * 1e5 = 0.02, so survival probability ~98%.\n\nIn the experiment, after dilution, the number of surviving plasmids is what matters. The number of survivors depends on the number of plasmids lost.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is plated against strain B, it affects only those with one mutation. So, after dilution, some of those plasmids survive enough to allow the phage to replicate and lyse.\n\nBut since strain B doesn't lyse, why did some of the phages die? Wait, no\u2014the initial experiment shows that in the first plate, half the colonies died, then they were plated again at 1e-7 M and another time at 1e-5 M. So perhaps the initial death is due to some plasmids being lost, and then further dilution restores some plasmids, allowing the phage to replicate and lyse.\n\nTherefore, the number of plasmids lost depends on the number of cells and the probability of losing a plasmid.\n\nIf N_initial = 1e6, and V = 1e-7 L, then \u03bb = 2e-7.\n\nSurvival probability is e^{-\u03bb} \u2248 1 - 2e-7 \u2248 0.9999998.\n\nWhich means almost all plasmids survive, so the phage can replicate and lyse.\n\nHowever, if N_initial is smaller, say 1e5, then \u03bb = 2e-9, so survival probability \u2248 0.99999998.\n\nStill almost certain.\n\nBut in the second plate, they're plated at 1e-5 M, which is higher dilution. This means less volume, so more plasmids lost. If N_initial is 1e5, then \u03bb = 2e-7, so survival probability \u2248 0.9998.\n\nIf N_initial is larger, say 1e6, then \u03bb = 2e-7 * 1e6 / 1e6 = 2e-7, same as before.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Perhaps the key is to determine the number of plasmids lost in each case.\n\nFrom the data, after dilution, four plasmids survived in the first plate, and forty in the second.\n\nWait, but the initial number is half the bacteria. So if half the colonies died, meaning each of the remaining half has plasmids. So after dilution, each of the surviving half has a certain number of plasmids.\n\nSuppose after dilution, each surviving colony has X plasmids.\n\nThen, when plated at 1:1e7, the number of plasmids lost is \u03bb = X * V, where V is 1e-7 L.\n\nSimilarly, when plated at 1:1e5, \u03bb' = X * 1e-5 L.\n\nThe number of survivors is e^{-\u03bb}, and similarly for e^{-\u03bb'}.\n\nIn the first plate, four plasmids survived, and in the second, forty.\n\nAssuming each surviving colony had the same number of plasmids, then:\n\nFor first plate: e^{-\u03bb} = 4/total_colony_count.\n\nFor second plate: e^{-\u03bb'} = 40/total_colony_count.\n\nAssuming total_colony_count is the same for both plates, we can compare the exponents.\n\nTaking natural logs:\n\n-\u03bb = ln(4/N)\n-\u03bb' = ln(40/N)\n\nSubtracting:\n\n-\u03bb' + \u03bb = ln(40) - ln(4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nSince \u03bb = X * 1e-7 and \u03bb' = X * 1e-5,\n\nX * 1e-5 - X * 1e-7 = X * 9e-6 = 2.3026\n\nSolving for X:\n\nX = 2.3026 / 9e-6 \u2248 255,844\n\nSo each surviving colony had approximately 255,844 plasmids.\n\nWait, that seems high. Typically, each E. coli has about 1e6 plasmids. So 255k is possible, but unlikely. Maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps each surviving colony had N plasmids, and the number of survivors is proportional to (1 - \u03bb)^N.\n\nWait, maybe I should model it differently.

If each phage loses two plasmids upon replication, then N_initial = number of plasmids per cell.\n\nAfter replication, the number of plasmids lost is 2*number of plasmids lost during replication.\n\nThe number of plasmids lost during replication is given by \u03bb = (number of plasmids lost) / (number of plasmids carried). Assuming \u03bb is small, we can approximate the number of plasmids lost as N * \u03bb.\n\nIf both mutations occurred, each plasmid loses two plasmids, so the number lost is 2N * \u03bb.\n\nBut the number lost must be an integer, so we round up.\n\nBut perhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plasmids lost per cell.\n\nIf the probability of losing a plasmid is p, then the expected number lost is Np.\n\nEach plasmid lost reduces the number of plasmids available for replication.\n\nThe number of plasmids remaining is N * e^{-Np}.\n\nBut in our case, some cells have lost all plasmids, so e^{-Np} = 0.\n\nBut in reality, it's probabilistic.

Let me think again.\n\nStrain B: lysogenic phage \u2192 lyse, so mutation must allow replication and cause lysis.\n\nStrain K: lysogenic phage \u2192 does not lyse, so mutation must prevent replication without causing lysis.\n\nAh, so the lysogenic phage has a mutation that stops it from replicating in strain K but allows it to replicate and cause lysis in strain B.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that disrupts replication, preventing the phage from replicating in strain K but allowing it to replicate and lyse in strain B.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage has two mutations: one that allows replication and lysis in strain B, and another that prevents replication in strain K.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"mutations\" occur in the T4 genome, so possibly, the lysogenic phage can replicate without causing lysis (mutation) and the lysogenic phage can cause lysis (another mutation).\n\nWait, no, the problem says the lysogenic phage does not lyse strain K, implying that the lysogenic phage can't replicate without causing lysis in strain K. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that stops replication in strain K but allows replication and lysis in strain B.\n\nSo the lysogenic phage has a mutation",

So the mutation in strain B's phage probably affects its ability to replicate, while strain K's phage doesn't have this issue.\n\nNow, there's an experiment where both types of phages infect a population of E. coli strain B. The result is that half of them are saturated (meaning they don't grow), then each half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B again, resulting in four plumes on strain B. Then another half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, giving four plumes on K and forty on B. \n\nThe key here is figuring out how much the mutations recombine during replication. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect some fraction of the cells to have both mutations. But since only the lysogenic phage caused issues, maybe the mutations aren't independent. \n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. In a typical double-strand break repair scenario, if two mutations occur independently, you might see a certain percentage of cells showing both. But in this case, only the lysogenic phage showed issues, suggesting that the mutations didn't interfere with replication. However, since both types of phages cause problems, maybe their mutations are linked.\n\nIf the mutations recombine, then each phage would have a version of the mutation. Since both phages cause problems, perhaps the recombination rate determines whether both mutations are present. The number of plumes suggests the frequency of successful replication. More plumes mean more successful duplications, implying higher recombination rates.\n\nLooking at the numbers: four plumes on B after dilution 1:10^7, meaning four cells successfully had both mutations. On K, forty plumes suggest many more successes. That seems like a high recombination rate.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, let's assume that recombination occurs at a rate r. The probability that both mutations are present in a cell is r. The expected number of plumes should be proportional to r multiplied by the total number of cells. However, without knowing the exact initial number of cells, we can make an approximation. If four cells produced plumes on B, that's 4 = r * N, where N is the total number. Similarly, on K, 40 = r * M, where M is the number of cells plated on K.\n\nBut wait, the way it's set up, the same cells are used for both experiments. So if four cells produce plumes on B, that means four cells have both mutations. On K, those same four cells would now be placed into a larger population, leading to more plumes. But according to the data, on K, 40 plumes are found, which is ten times more than on B. That suggests that the chance of duplication is higher for the K cells.\n\nSo if the chance is ten times higher, that implies the recombination rate is ten times higher. If r is the recombination rate, then the number of plumes on K would be ten times that on B. Therefore, if four plumes on B correspond to a certain r, four on K would imply ten times that r. But wait, actually, the number of plumes depends on the product of r and the number of cells. So if four cells show plumes on B, and similarly four on K, but the plume count on K is ten times as much, that suggests r on K is ten times higher. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to r times the number of cells, if the same number of cells are used, then r must be ten times higher. Wait, no\u2014if r is the same, then the plume counts should be similar. So if the number on K is ten times higher, r must be ten times higher. But that contradicts the initial assumption because if r is higher, the chances of both mutations being present increase. But in reality, both mutations are causing issues, so recombination makes sense.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that the number of plumes indicates the recombination frequency. Each plume represents a cell that successfully replicated both mutations. So if four plumes appear on B after dilution 1:10^7, that means four cells had both mutations. On K, these same four cells are now in a higher concentration, leading to more plumes. But the actual count is 40, which is ten times more. This suggests that the chance of duplication is ten times higher for K. \n\nTherefore, the recombination rate must be higher. If four cells give four plumes on B, then on K, each cell has ten times the chance. So if the original chance was x%, now it's 10x%. To find x, assuming that the number of plumes scales linearly with the chance, then 4 = x% of N, and 40 = 10x% of M. But without knowing N and M, we can say that the recombination rate increased tenfold. \n\nGiven that, the recombination rate would be ten times what it was before. But the options given are small percentages. Maybe I'm missing something. Alternatively, the number of plumes reflects the square root of the number of trials, but that's not directly applicable here. \n\nAnother approach: the probability of both mutations in a cell is r, so the expected number of plumes is r * n, where n is the number of cells. For B, four plumes imply r * n_B = 4, and for K, r * n_K = 40. Assuming n_K = 10 * n_B (since each cell in K is a parent cell from B), then 40 = r * 10n_B => 4 = r * n_B. Which matches the first equation. So this holds true, confirming that the recombination rate is consistent across both experiments.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate is such that when the same cells are plated on K, which has fewer cells, the chance of duplication is higher. Specifically, the chance on K is ten times that on B. So if on B it's x%, on K it's 10x%. But the problem asks for the amount of recombination, not the exact rate. The options are given as percentages, so perhaps the recombination rate is 10%.\n\nWait, but looking back, the answer choices include 0.02% and others, but my conclusion is that the recombination rate increases tenfold. That seems too large for the given options. Perhaps I made a mistake. Let me try again.\n\nSuppose that the chance of both mutations occurring in a cell is r. Then, the number of plumes on B after dilution is r * N, where N is the number of cells. Similarly, on K, the number is r * M, where M is the number of cells plated on K. From the results, four plumes on B imply r * N = 4, and forty on K imply r * M = 40. \n\nAssuming that the number of cells in the K experiment is ten times less than the B experiment (since each cell in K comes from a cell in B), then M = N / 10. Substituting, 40 = r * (N/10) => 40 = (r/N) * N / 10 => 40 = r / 10 => r = 400%. That's impossible, so I must have misunderstood.\n\nAh, no\u2014the dilutions affect the concentration. After dilution 1:10^7, the concentration is 1e-7 times the original. Dilution 1:10^5 is 1e-5 times. So the chance of replication is higher for the K cells because they're more concentrated. If the chance of duplication is ten times higher, then r increases tenfold. \n\nBut the problem states that both phages cause issues. So the chance of both mutations is the same in both cases. The difference comes from the concentration. So if the concentration is ten times higher, the chance of duplication is ten times higher. Thus, r is ten times higher than before. \n\nGiven the options, the closest is 0.05% or 0.02%, but none match exactly. Alternatively, maybe the calculation involves the square root of the dilution factor. For example, sqrt(1e7) = 316, sqrt(1e5)=316.23, so the ratio is about 10. So the recombination rate increases by the square root of the dilution factor? Not sure.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of plumes relates to the number of cells that successfully replicated both mutations. If the chance of duplication is ten times higher, then the recombination rate increases by ten times. But the options don't go beyond 5%. Perhaps the correct answer is 0.05% or 0.02%, but I'm not confident.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination rate is calculated as (plumes on K)/(plumes on B) - 1, but that gives (40/4)-1=9, which isn't a percentage. Maybe I'm approaching this wrong.\n\nPerhaps the recombination rate is determined by the number of plumes. If four plumes appear on B, and forty on K, that suggests that the chance of duplication is ten times higher for K. Therefore, the recombination rate is ten times higher. But the options don't have ten times; instead, they have percentages.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is the square root of the dilution factor. For example, the square root of 1e7 is 316, and square root of 1e5 is 316.23. So the ratio is roughly 10. So the recombination rate increases by a factor of ten. Thus, if originally r was x%, now it's 10x%. Looking at the options, 10% isn't available, but 0.1% is, which is ten times smaller. Hmm.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a simpler way.

So, half the culture is treated with mutantphage A (lysogenic), which should kill E. coli strain B, while half is treated with mutantphage B (lytic), killing strain K. After incubation, the plates are diluted and plated again on their respective strains.\n\nHalf of the B-plate has been killed, meaning the lysogenic phage worked there. Then it's diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K. On K, four plaques were found, which suggests that some of the B-diluted plasmids might have worked. Similarly, on the K-plate, four were found, indicating that the lysogenic phage caused some damage there as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the mutantphage was lysogenic and killed B, then the lysogenic phage shouldn't affect K either because K is resistant. So why would there be any plaques on K? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, half the cells are treated with mutantphage A (lytic), which kills strain K. The other half are treated with mutantphage B (lysozyme?), which kills strain B. After incubation, the plates are diluted 1:10^7 (meaning 1 part of the culture plus 10^7 parts water) and plated on strain B for the first half and on strain K for the second half.\n\nIn the first half (strain B), the lysogenic phage (mutant B) should have caused the lytic fission, leading to cell death. If all colonies die, it means the lysogenic phage worked. However, according to the data, four pluses are found on K, which should mean that the lysogenic phage didn't work there. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nHold on, maybe I misinterpreted the initial conditions. The problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission but causes lysogenic. So when it infects strain B, it doesn't lyse it, hence dies. When it infects strain K, it doesn't do anything because K is resistant. So in the first half, only strain B should be killed, producing 0 or few pluses. In the second half, K should be unaffected, so 0 pluses.\n\nBut according to the data, half of the B-plate had pluses, and half of the K-plate had pluses. That suggests that some of the lysogenic phage did affect both strains somehow. How?\n\nMaybe the mutations are in different regions. Or perhaps there's interference between them. Alternatively, the presence of multiple mutations could lead to interference where one mutation affects the replication or the lysogenic cycle of the other.\n\nAnother angle: If the two mutations are in the same gene locus, their combination could lead to incomplete interference. For example, if one mutation allows the phage to replicate better without causing full lysis, and another mutation makes it more efficient at lysogenizing, then together they might reduce the effective number of lysogenic phages.\n\nThe formula for calculating the recombination coefficient r is:\n\np = (m - n)/m\n\nwhere m is the observed double reduction, and n is the expected double reduction under complete interference.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid copies per cell determines how much interference occurs. Each mutation reduces the likelihood of interference. For example, if each mutation independently reduces the probability of interference by a certain factor, the overall effect is multiplicative.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found on the K-plate, which is supposed to be unaffected, this suggests that some of the lysogenic phage did work there. Since the B-plate had four pluses (which should indicate the lysogenic phage worked in those cells), perhaps the lysogenic phage in mutant B had an effect, but in mutant K, it didn't. But wait, the B-plate should have none, unless there's cross-reactivity.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nWhen the mutant B is applied to strain B, it should kill strain B (no pluses). When applied to strain K, it should not kill strain K (no pluses). However, the actual results showed four pluses on K and four on B. This seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the phage A (lytic) was active elsewhere, but the question says both mutants are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the same region, so they can interfere with each other. For example, if the lysogenic phage requires a specific site for replication, and the mutation in one region disrupts the other, leading to less interference.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the possible options. The answer choices are percentages, ranging from 0.01% up to 5%. Given that the correct answer is among these, we can infer the recombination percentage.\n\nIf both mutations are independent, the expected number of plasmids per cell would be reduced by the product of the probabilities of each mutation. The observed number of plasmids per cell in the K-plate is higher than expected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage affected the replication in some cells, possibly due to interference from the lysogenic phage itself or another mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a situation where the lysogenic phage cannot effectively replicate, reducing the number of plasmids. This would lead to fewer plasmids per cell, thus increasing the chance of plating successfully. \n\nIf four pluses are found on K, which is supposed to have no plasmids, this indicates that some plasmids were successfully replicated. The number of plasmids per cell before treatment would determine how many were successful. Let\u2019s assume that without any mutations, each cell has, say, x plasmids. With mutations, let\u2019s denote the total number of plasmids as y, where y = x + r * x, where r is the recombination fraction.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Another way: The number of plasmids per cell after treatment can be calculated using the formula for incomplete interference. The number of plasmids per cell, Y, is given by:\n\nY = (y)(1 - r)\n\nWhere y is the original number of plasmids per cell, and r is the recombination coefficient.\n\nAssuming that without any mutations, each cell has, say, 1 plasmid. Then, with r mutations, the number of plasmids becomes Y = 1*(1 - r).\n\nNow, if in the K-plate, four pluses are found, but without any plasmids, this suggests that each of the cells had plasmids, but they failed to replicate, resulting in no plasmids left. Therefore, the observed number of plasmids is zero, but the number of cells with plasmids is four. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the number of plasmids in the media. If each cell starts with Y plasmids, and some plasmids replicate and others don't, the number of new plasmids added depends on the rate of replication. If the number of plasmids is high enough, even a small fraction will replicate, leading to more plasmids.\n\nSo, if the K-plate shows four pluses, meaning four cells had plasmids, but without any mutations, all cells would have zero plasmids. The number of plasmids per cell after treatment is determined by the replication efficiency. Assuming replication is efficient, most cells would still have plasmids, but a small fraction would lose them.\n\nThe number of plasmids lost can be modeled using the Poisson approximation for incomplete interference, where the loss is approximately \u03bb = p, and the remaining plasmids follow a binomial distribution.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found on K, and assuming the number of cells plated is N, the expected number of plasmids lost would be \u03bb = p * N, where p is the probability that a single plasmid is lost. If we assume that p is small, we can approximate the expected number of plasmids lost as \u03bb \u2248 N * p.\n\nHowever, without knowing N, it's tricky. Perhaps instead, we should focus on the ratio of plasmids between the two plates. The K-plate had four plomas, whereas the B-plate had four plomas. But without mutations, the B-plate should have none. This suggests that the lysogenic phage worked on the K-plate, but not on the B-plate, which aligns with the description.\n\nWait, but the B-plate had four plomas. If the lysogenic phage worked on the B-plate, then the plasmids would survive, leading to more plomas. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage in mutant B caused some plasmids to replicate, making the B-plate have more plomas than expected, but K-plate had none. But the data shows four plomas on both, which complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination coefficient using the observed plasmids. The expected number of plasmids per cell in the absence of mutations is Y = 1. With recombination, Y = 1 - r. The number of plasmids lost is proportional to r.\n\nIf in the K-plate, four plomas were found, and without mutations, there should be none, this implies that the lysogenic phage in mutant K replicated, leading to plasmids being lost. So, the number of plasmids lost is 4. The number of plasmids per cell without mutations is Y = 1 - r.\n\nThe expected number of plasmids lost per cell is p = r * Y. If we assume that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the recombination coefficient, then 4 = r * (number of cells plated). Without knowing the number of cells, it's hard to compute r directly. However, considering that the K-plate had four plomas, and the B-plate had four, perhaps the recombination coefficient is such that the lysogenic phage in mutant B caused some plasmids to replicate, leading to four plomas on the B-plate despite no mutations, but the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't cause any plasmids to replicate, leaving zero plomas on the K-plate.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage in mutant B had some activity, contributing to four plomas on the B-plate. Conversely, the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't contribute, leading to no plomas on the K-plate. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in mutant B must have caused some plasmids to replicate, while in mutant K, it didn't.\n\nTo find the recombination coefficient, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (m - n)/m\n\nwhere m is the observed double reduction, and n is the expected double reduction. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact application here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expected number of plasmids lost per cell is r * Y, and Y = 1 - r. If four plomas were found on the K-plate, then:\n\nNumber of plasmids lost per cell = 4 / N\n\nBut without knowing N, it's difficult. However, if the recombination coefficient is low, the number of plasmids lost would be small relative to the total number. Given that four plomas were found on both plates, the recombination must have occurred somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest answer is H. 0.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, J. 0.05 percent and I. 0.02 percent are also options. Considering that the number of plomas is four on both plates, and the expectation without recombination is zero on K, the recombination must have occurred in such a way that the lysogenic phage in mutant B allowed some plasmids to replicate, leading to four plomas on the B-plate, while the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't allow any plasmids to replicate, resulting in zero plomas on the K-plate.\n\nTherefore, the recombination coefficient r can be estimated by comparing the expected number of plasmids lost. If the expected number of plasmids lost is 4/N, then r = 4/(N(1 - r)). Solving this equation gives r \u2248 4/(N + 4). Assuming N is large, r \u2248 4/N. But without knowing N, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plomas on the B-plate is four, and without recombination, you'd expect none, the recombination must have occurred in such a way that four plasmids were lost. Thus, the recombination coefficient is likely around 0.5%.\n\nBut I'm still uncertain. Given the options, the most plausible answer is H. 0.5 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which is resistant, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause any issues since strain K isn't affected by it.\n\nThe experiment involves mixing the cells from both strains. So, half the culture is treated with mutantphage A (lysogenic), which should kill E. coli strain B, while half is treated with mutantphage B (lytic), killing strain K. After incubation, the plates are diluted and plated again on their respective strains.\n\nHalf of the B-plate has been killed, meaning the lysogenic phage worked there. Then it's diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain K. On K, four plaques were found, which suggests that some of the B-diluted plasmids might have worked. Similarly, on the K-plate, four were found, indicating that the lysogenic phage caused some damage there as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, if the mutantphage was lysogenic and killed B, then the lysogenic phage shouldn't affect K either because K is resistant. So why would there be any plaques on K? Maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me try to outline the steps properly.\n\nFirst, half the cells are treated with mutantphage A (lytic), which kills strain K. The other half are treated with mutantphage B (lysozyme?), which kills strain B. After incubation, the plates are diluted 1:10^7 (meaning 1 part of the culture plus 10^7 parts water) and plated on strain B for the first half and on strain K for the second half.\n\nIn the first half (strain B), the lysogenic phage (mutant B) should have caused the lytic fission, leading to cell death. If all colonies die, it means the lysogenic phage worked. However, according to the data, four pluses are found on K, which should mean that the lysogenic phage didn't work there. Wait, that contradicts my earlier thought.\n\nHold on, maybe I misinterpreted the initial conditions. The problem states that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission but causes lysogenic. So when it infects strain B, it doesn't lyse it, hence dies. When it infects strain K, it doesn't do anything because K is resistant. So in the first half, only strain B should be killed, producing 0 or few pluses. In the second half, K should be unaffected, so 0 pluses.\n\nBut according to the data, half of the B-plate had pluses, and half of the K-plate had pluses. That suggests that some of the lysogenic phage did affect both strains somehow. How?\n\nMaybe the mutations are in different regions. Or perhaps there's interference between them. Alternatively, the presence of multiple mutations could lead to interference where one mutation affects the replication or the lysogenic cycle of the other.\n\nAnother angle: If the two mutations are in the same gene locus, their combination could lead to incomplete interference. For example, if one mutation allows the phage to replicate better without causing full lysis, and another mutation makes it more efficient at lysogenizing, then together they might reduce the effective number of lysogenic phages.\n\nThe formula for calculating the recombination coefficient r is:\n\np = (m - n)/m\n\nwhere m is the observed double reduction, and n is the expected double reduction under complete interference.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid copies per cell determines how much interference occurs. Each mutation reduces the likelihood of interference. For example, if each mutation independently reduces the probability of interference by a certain factor, the overall effect is multiplicative.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found on the K-plate, which is supposed to be unaffected, this suggests that some of the lysogenic phage did work there. Since the B-plate had four pluses (which should indicate the lysogenic phage worked in those cells), perhaps the lysogenic phage in mutant B had an effect, but in mutant K, it didn't. But wait, the B-plate should have none, unless there's cross-reactivity.\n\nWait, now I'm really confused. Let's approach this systematically.\n\nWhen the mutant B is applied to strain B, it should kill strain B (no pluses). When applied to strain K, it should not kill strain K (no pluses). However, the actual results showed four pluses on K and four on B. This seems contradictory. Therefore, perhaps the phage A (lytic) was active elsewhere, but the question says both mutants are present.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations are in the same region, so they can interfere with each other. For example, if the lysogenic phage requires a specific site for replication, and the mutation in one region disrupts the other, leading to less interference.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the possible options. The answer choices are percentages, ranging from 0.01% up to 5%. Given that the correct answer is among these, we can infer the recombination percentage.\n\nIf both mutations are independent, the expected number of plasmids per cell would be reduced by the product of the probabilities of each mutation. The observed number of plasmids per cell in the K-plate is higher than expected, suggesting that the lysogenic phage affected the replication in some cells, possibly due to interference from the lysogenic phage itself or another mutation.\n\nWait, perhaps the presence of both mutations leads to a situation where the lysogenic phage cannot effectively replicate, reducing the number of plasmids. This would lead to fewer plasmids per cell, thus increasing the chance of plating successfully. \n\nIf four pluses are found on K, which is supposed to have no plasmids, this indicates that some plasmids were successfully replicated. The number of plasmids per cell before treatment would determine how many were successful. Let\u2019s assume that without any mutations, each cell has, say, x plasmids. With mutations, let\u2019s denote the total number of plasmids as y, where y = x + r * x, where r is the recombination fraction.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Another way: The number of plasmids per cell after treatment can be calculated using the formula for incomplete interference. The number of plasmids per cell, Y, is given by:\n\nY = (y)(1 - r)\n\nWhere y is the original number of plasmids per cell, and r is the recombination coefficient.\n\nAssuming that without any mutations, each cell has, say, 1 plasmid. Then, with r mutations, the number of plasmids becomes Y = 1*(1 - r).\n\nNow, if in the K-plate, four pluses are found, but without any plasmids, this suggests that each of the cells had plasmids, but they failed to replicate, resulting in no plasmids left. Therefore, the observed number of plasmids is zero, but the number of cells with plasmids is four. Hmm, this is confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the number of plasmids in the media. If each cell starts with Y plasmids, and some plasmids replicate and others don't, the number of new plasmids added depends on the rate of replication. If the number of plasmids is high enough, even a small fraction will replicate, leading to more plasmids.\n\nSo, if the K-plate shows four pluses, meaning four cells had plasmids, but without any mutations, all cells would have zero plasmids. The number of plasmids per cell after treatment is determined by the replication efficiency. Assuming replication is efficient, most cells would still have plasmids, but a small fraction would lose them.\n\nThe number of plasmids lost can be modeled using the Poisson approximation for incomplete interference, where the loss is approximately \u03bb = p, and the remaining plasmids follow a binomial distribution.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found on K, and assuming the number of cells plated is N, the expected number of plasmids lost would be \u03bb = p * N, where p is the probability that a single plasmid is lost. If we assume that p is small, we can approximate the expected number of plasmids lost as \u03bb \u2248 N * p.\n\nHowever, without knowing N, it's tricky. Perhaps instead, we should focus on the ratio of plasmids between the two plates. The K-plate had four plomas, whereas the B-plate had four plomas. But without mutations, the B-plate should have none. This suggests that the lysogenic phage worked on the K-plate, but not on the B-plate, which aligns with the description.\n\nWait, but the B-plate had four plomas. If the lysogenic phage worked on the B-plate, then the plasmids would survive, leading to more plomas. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage in mutant B caused some plasmids to replicate, making the B-plate have more plomas than expected, but K-plate had none. But the data shows four plomas on both, which complicates things.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination coefficient using the observed plasmids. The expected number of plasmids per cell in the absence of mutations is Y = 1. With recombination, Y = 1 - r. The number of plasmids lost is proportional to r.\n\nIf in the K-plate, four plomas were found, and without mutations, there should be none, this implies that the lysogenic phage in mutant K replicated, leading to plasmids being lost. So, the number of plasmids lost is 4. The number of plasmids per cell without mutations is Y = 1 - r.\n\nThe expected number of plasmids lost per cell is p = r * Y. If we assume that the number of plasmids lost is proportional to the recombination coefficient, then 4 = r * (number of cells plated). Without knowing the number of cells, it's hard to compute r directly. However, considering that the K-plate had four plomas, and the B-plate had four, perhaps the recombination coefficient is such that the lysogenic phage in mutant B caused some plasmids to replicate, leading to four plomas on the B-plate despite no mutations, but the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't cause any plasmids to replicate, leaving zero plomas on the K-plate.\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage in mutant B had some activity, contributing to four plomas on the B-plate. Conversely, the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't contribute, leading to no plomas on the K-plate. Therefore, the lysogenic phage in mutant B must have caused some plasmids to replicate, while in mutant K, it didn't.\n\nTo find the recombination coefficient, we can use the formula:\n\nr = (m - n)/m\n\nwhere m is the observed double reduction, and n is the expected double reduction. However, I'm not entirely sure about the exact application here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the expected number of plasmids lost per cell is r * Y, and Y = 1 - r. If four plomas were found on the K-plate, then:\n\nNumber of plasmids lost per cell = 4 / N\n\nBut without knowing N, it's difficult. However, if the recombination coefficient is low, the number of plasmids lost would be small relative to the total number. Given that four plomas were found on both plates, the recombination must have occurred somewhere.\n\nLooking back at the options, the closest answer is H. 0.5 percent, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, J. 0.05 percent and I. 0.02 percent are also options. Considering that the number of plomas is four on both plates, and the expectation without recombination is zero on K, the recombination must have occurred in such a way that the lysogenic phage in mutant B allowed some plasmids to replicate, leading to four plomas on the B-plate, while the lysogenic phage in mutant K didn't allow any plasmids to replicate, resulting in zero plomas on the K-plate.\n\nTherefore, the recombination coefficient r can be estimated by comparing the expected number of plasmids lost. If the expected number of plasmids lost is 4/N, then r = 4/(N(1 - r)). Solving this equation gives r \u2248 4/(N + 4). Assuming N is large, r \u2248 4/N. But without knowing N, it's unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plomas on the B-plate is four, and without recombination, you'd expect none, the recombination must have occurred in such a way that four plasmids were lost.

One half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Then, four plumes were found on K's lawn and 40 on B's. \n\nHmm, I remember from my studies that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages. If there's complete recombination, their offspring would have no mutations; if partial, some would have one mutation; and if none, then it's a double mutation. In this case, since only K shows lysogenic infection, that suggests the phages have partially recombined.\n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. Dilution affects the probability of observing the phenotype. The number of plasmids per cell increases as you dilute more. So, if you dilute by 1:10^7, the expected number of plasmids per cell would be much higher than 2, which might explain why K had fewer plumes\u2014maybe because its phage didn't lyse any cells, meaning it didn't replicate enough or didn't take up enough DNA.\n\nWait, the formula for calculating the number of recombinant plasmids in a population is something like (p/q)(n+1), where p is the proportion of individuals with the mutation, q without, and n is the total number. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the number of observed recombinants relates to the expected probabilities.\n\nIn this case, the total number of plumes should follow a binomial distribution. For example, if each phage has a certain probability of causing an issue, the combined effect over multiple cells would average out. Since only K showed issues, perhaps the phage from strain B had a lower chance of replication.\n\nBut wait, the key here is determining how many times the two mutations occurred together. Each time a phage takes up a plasmid, it could either carry one or neither mutation. If they're completely recombined, the offspring would have neither mutation. If only one mutation exists, the offspring would have that mutation.\n\nLooking at the data: when the phage was plated on strain B, four plumes appeared. On strain K, 40 did. That seems quite high, suggesting that the phage from strain B replicated less, leading to fewer plumes on strain B's lawn. Conversely, on strain K's lawn, the phage replicated more, so more plumes grew there.\n\nSo, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40/4 = 10 times higher. This ratio corresponds to the likelihood of the phages taking up the mutations. The formula for the number of recombinant plasmids is often expressed as R = (p/q)(n+1), where R is the number of recombinant plasmids, p is the frequency of the mutated allele, and q non-mutated.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the expected number of recombinants would depend on how likely the two mutations were to combine. If the phages partially recombine, the number of recombinants would increase relative to the total number of plasmids.\n\nGiven the dilutions, the expected number of plasmids in each half after dilution would be different. For example, diluting 1:10^7 reduces the chance of any individual cell having two plasmids, making it less likely to see both mutations. However, on strain K's lawn, which presumably has fewer plasmids due to a higher rate of replication, we saw more plumes, indicating more successful combinations.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of more plumes on strain K suggests that the phages from strain B replicated fewer times, implying incomplete recombination. The exact calculation involves using the dilution factors to determine the probabilities of each outcome, but intuitively, the fact that four plumes appear on strain K suggests that the phage from strain B had a lower success rate in replicating, thus partially recombining.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided, the possible answers range from very low percentages to 2%. Since the recombination isn't complete, but also not minimal, it leans towards a moderate percentage. Option G is 0.5 percent, which seems plausible given that the numbers are somewhat spread out.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the same phage infects strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, both phages don't cause issues.\n\nThe experiment involved two halves of a culture plate each. One half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. Then, four plumes were found on K's lawn and 40 on B's. \n\nHmm, I remember from my studies that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between phages. If there's complete recombination, their offspring would have no mutations; if partial, some would have one mutation; and if none, then it's a double mutation. In this case, since only K shows lysogenic infection, that suggests the phages have partially recombined.\n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. Dilution affects the probability of observing the phenotype. The number of plasmids per cell increases as you dilute more. So, if you dilute by 1:10^7, the expected number of plasmids per cell would be much higher than 2, which might explain why K had fewer plumes\u2014maybe because its phage didn't lyse any cells, meaning it didn't replicate enough or didn't take up enough DNA.\n\nWait, the formula for calculating the number of recombinant plasmids in a population is something like (p/q)(n+1), where p is the proportion of individuals with the mutation, q without, and n is the total number. But maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, the number of observed recombinants relates to the expected probabilities.\n\nIn this case, the total number of plumes should follow a binomial distribution. For example, if each phage has a certain probability of causing an issue, the combined effect over multiple cells would average out. Since only K showed issues, perhaps the phage from strain B had a lower chance of replication.\n\nBut wait, the key here is determining how many times the two mutations occurred together. Each time a phage takes up a plasmid, it could either carry one or neither mutation. If they're completely recombined, the offspring would have neither mutation. If only one mutation exists, the offspring would have that mutation.\n\nLooking at the data: when the phage was plated on strain B, four plumes appeared. On strain K, 40 did. That seems quite high, suggesting that the phage from strain B replicated less, leading to fewer plumes on strain B's lawn. Conversely, on strain K's lawn, the phage replicated more, so more plumes grew there.\n\nSo, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 40/4 = 10 times higher. This ratio corresponds to the likelihood of the phages taking up the mutations. The formula for the number of recombinant plasmids is often expressed as R = (p/q)(n+1), where R is the number of recombinant plasmids, p is the frequency of the mutated allele, and q non-mutated.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors, the expected number of recombinants would depend on how likely the two mutations were to combine. If the phages partially recombine, the number of recombinants would increase relative to the total number of plasmids.\n\nGiven the dilutions, the expected number of plasmids in each half after dilution would be different. For example, diluting 1:10^7 reduces the chance of any individual cell having two plasmids, making it less likely to see both mutations. However, on strain K's lawn, which presumably has fewer plasmids due to a higher rate of replication, we saw more plumes, indicating more successful combinations.\n\nPutting this all together, the presence of more plumes on strain K suggests that the phages from strain B replicated fewer times, implying incomplete recombination. The exact calculation involves using the dilution factors to determine the probabilities of each outcome, but intuitively, the fact that four plumes appear on strain K suggests that the phage from strain B had a lower success rate in replicating, thus partially recombining.\n\nNow, looking at the options provided, the possible answers range from very low percentages to 2%. Since the recombination isn't complete, but also not minimal, it leans towards a moderate percentage. Option G is 0.5 percent, which seems plausible given that the numbers are somewhat spread out.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

This is called saturation division.\n\nThe experiment involves diluting the phages into bacterial cultures. They first take half of the inoculum and dilute it 1:10^7, which means each bacterium has 1e-7 phages. Then they plate these on a strain B lawn. Half of the colonies (so 50%) die, meaning the phages must have caused DNA breaks that affect their replication or lysis.\n\nThen they take another half of the original sample, dilute it 1:10^5, and plate on strain K. Now, four colonies die on strain K. \n\nFrom what I remember, the number of recombinants (mutually exclusive mutations) affects the probability of crossing over during recombination. If there's no recombination, the probability of getting either mutation is additive. But if there's complete recombination, you get a double mutant, and the chance of crossing over would be lower.\n\nIn the initial experiment, only the lysogenic phage affected strain B, leading to saturation. So the lysogenic phage carries the mutation in rII. The lysogenic phage must have a functional lysase enzyme for it to replicate without cutting the DNA. However, the lysogenic phage might also have a recombination point where it integrates the mutation from the T_4 phage. That would mean that the lysogenic phage can produce multiple phages with different mutations due to recombination.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage is mixed with the lysogenic phage strain B, the lysogenic phages can integrate the T_4 mutation into their prophage genes. If the phages can recombine, then each phage will have a unique combination of mutations. When they replicate, they'll cause different issues depending on the recombination pattern.\n\nBut wait, in the first culture, only the lysogenic phages were problematic, and the lysogenic phage strain B wasn't. That suggests that the lysogenic phage strain B doesn't carry any T_4 mutation. So all the lysogenic phages are the same strain, carrying the T_4 mutation.\n\nIn the second culture, the phages were mixed with strain B. Since only the lysogenic phages replicated, the surviving ones would have the T_4 mutation. But in the experiment, only some of the colonies died, meaning fewer phages survived. Wait, actually, when you plate on a strain B lawn, if the phages are lysogenic, they should not lyse the cells and replicate without issues. Hmm, maybe I'm confused about the setup.\n\nWait, let me think again. In the first case, they took half of the population and made them less fit by having fewer phages. Then they plated those on a strain B lawn. The surviving phages (those that didn't lyse the cells) would presumably continue to grow. However, when they plated these on a strain K lawn, only a few colonies died, indicating that the phages were more likely to lyse the strain K cells. So the phages with the T_4 mutation (which is lysogenic) could replicate and lyse the strain B cells, but cannot replicate well on strain K because strain K cells don't support replication as well.\n\nSo the presence of recombination would allow the lysogenic phages to replicate better on strain K, as the phages can lyse the cells due to their own lysases. Therefore, recombination reduces the likelihood of the phages being able to replicate on certain substrates.\n\nNow, the number of recombinants observed in the second culture. Four colonies died on strain K. How many phages were present? The dilution was 1:10^5, so each colony had 1e-5 phages. Assuming each phage produces one DNA copy, the total number of DNA copies per colony would be 1e-5. But since the phages are lysogenic, they can lyse the strain K cells, so they wouldn't contribute to the death count here.\n\nWait, maybe I'm mixing up the experiments. Alternatively, perhaps the number of plasmid copies or the number of DNA copies that can replicate depends on whether the phage can lyse the host cell.\n\nIf the phages carry recombination points, they can produce different numbers of DNA copies upon integration, affecting their ability to replicate. For example, a double mutant phage might produce more plasmids upon replication, increasing its fitness on certain substrates.\n\nIn the second culture, when the phages are mixed with strain K, some phages may have produced enough plasmids to replicate successfully on strain K cells. The fact that only four colonies died suggests that the phages with recombination were more likely to replicate on strain K. Alternatively, if the recombination was complete, the phages couldn't replicate on strain K because the lysase wasn't active, so fewer phages died.\n\nAlternatively, considering the experiment steps:\n\n1. Take half of the population.\n   - Dilute 1:1e7 phages.\n   - Plate on strain B lawn.\n     - Only half of the colonies died, implying that the phages with mutations in rII integrated into the T_4 phage and became lysogenic, making them non-viable on strain B.\n\n2. Take another half of the population.\n   - Dilute 1:1e5 phages.\n   - Plate on strain K lawn.\n     - Found four colonies that died. Since strain K lacks the T_4 mutation (assuming), these phages must have been lysogenic and thus replicate without problems on strain K. But why did only four die?\n\nWait, perhaps the number of dead colonies relates to the number of viable phages. If the phages with recombination were better at replicating on strain K, fewer would replicate, hence fewer colonies survive. Conversely, without recombination, they might replicate better on strain B, explaining the first result.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of recombinant phages affects the survival rate. If the recombination is incomplete, the phages might replicate better on strain K, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nGiven that the first experiment shows full damage on strain B and partial on K, and the second experiment shows some damage on K, we can infer that recombination allows the phages to replicate better on strain K, hence fewer phages replicate there, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency (rf), we can use the formula:\n\n rf = (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%\n\nIn the second experiment, four colonies died on strain K. Assuming each colony corresponds to a phage, and the number of phages per colony is 1e-5 (since the dilution is 1:1e5), the total number of plasmids is 4 * 1e-5 = 4e-5 plasmids.\n\nAssuming each plasmid represents a possible recombination site, the rf would be the proportion of recombinant plasmids among all plasmids. However, without knowing the total number of plasmids, it's tricky. Maybe instead, using the concept that the number of recombinant phages is related to the square root of the number of offsprings, assuming random mating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of dead colonies relates to the number of successful replications on strain K. If the phages with recombination could replicate better on strain K, then fewer phages replicate there, leading to fewer deaths.\n\nGiven that four colonies died on K, and each colony corresponds to a phage, the total number of phages on K is 4. Each phage was replicated with a higher success rate due to recombination.\n\nHowever, without exact data on plasmid counts or replication efficiency, it's challenging to compute rf directly. Perhaps an alternative approach is needed.\n\nAnother angle: the number of recombinant mutations indicates how much of the T_4 mutation was integrated into the lysogenic phage. The more recombination, the more different mutations a single phage can produce.\n\nSince the phages with recombination could cause varying levels of damage, the number of plasmids (and thus the number of mutations) varies. The experiment showed that some phages (with recombination) could replicate better on strain K, leading to fewer deaths. The number of dead colonies relates inversely to the number of successful replications, which depends on recombination.\n\nGiven the options, the answer is likely a small percentage, possibly around 1% or 2%.

The other group has a lower dilution ratio (1:10^5), resulting in more plasmids, and then plating onto strain K's lawn. From this, four plaques are found on K, and 40 on B.\n\nI remember that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If there's recombination, plasmids from one host can mix with those from another. In this case, if the two mutations cause recombination, each phage would produce a unique version of the phage DNA, allowing for independent replication and potential for horizontal gene transfer.\n\nThe key here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. The formula used for recombinant frequency (RF) is typically RF = (p * q + r * s - p * q * r * s)/(1 - p * q * r * s)), where p and q are probabilities of recombination in each parent, and r and s in the offspring. However, since we're dealing with binary outcomes (either recombined or not), maybe a simpler approach applies.\n\nAnother approach is using the equation for the expected number of recombinants. The probability of recombination occurring at a specific site is often given as R. If the observed recombination rate matches what would be expected under different scenarios (like no recombination, full recombination), we can solve for R.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the presence of a significant number of plasmids suggests that the two mutation strains have mixed. Since the population was split into two groups with different dilutions, the mixing would depend on the relative proportions of the two mutation strains.\n\nWait, the problem states that only strain B survives when both mutation types are present. So, the initial infection leads to a mixture where some cells may have plasmids from either mutation type. After selection, only some cells (those with the right combination of mutations) survive.\n\nWhen the first group is plated on strain B's lawn, their low plasmid concentration means that any new phage replication must rely on existing plasmids. If there's recombination, each phage would have its own unique DNA, making replication harder. This could lead to fewer surviving cells upon selection, explaining why only some cells survived.\n\nSimilarly, the second group with higher plasmid concentration might replicate more easily, leading to more survival on strain K's lawn. But the exact numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems like a lot of variation, suggesting significant recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination fraction, I think the formula is RF = [ (p + q)^2 - p^2 - q^2 ] / 1, where p and q are the probabilities of recombination in each direction. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as (pq + qp)/1, assuming no interference. But perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the proportion of recombinant individuals.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two mutation types must have mixed, the expected number of recombinants can help determine the frequency. If all were non-recombining, the number of survivors would be less than expected. With some recombination, more survivors occur.\n\nGiven that only a small number survived on strain K (4) compared to B (40), it indicates that most plasmids came from the other strain. This suggests high recombination. \n\nBut let's get back to the math. Suppose the frequency of recombination is R. Then the probability that a cell has a plasmid from either mutation depends on whether R is greater than 0.5. If R > 0.5, the majority come from one mutation; otherwise, it's split.\n\nIf the two mutations have an equal chance of being inherited, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on R. The observed numbers suggest that recombination is likely. Let's consider that the actual number of recombinants is proportional to R.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of recombinants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = n * (R * (1 - R))\n\nWhere n is the total number of cells, and R is the recombination frequency. But without knowing n, this isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutation types are present, the chance that a cell has both mutations (recombination) is R. Therefore, the fraction of cells with recombination is R.\n\nFrom the experiment, when the population is split into two groups, the number of plasmids determines whether a cell survives. On strain B, cells with recombination would require a certain number of plasmids to replicate successfully. Similarly, on strain K, the same logic applies.\n\nSince only 40% of the population survived on B, and 10% on K, this suggests that recombination is significant. To find the exact value, we might set up equations based on the plasmid counts.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mutation type contributes a certain number of plasmids. If recombination occurs, each phage will have a unique combination. Without recombination, they share the same plasmid.\n\nSuppose the original strain B has a certain number of plasmids, say P. When a phage carries mutation 1, it has P1 plasmids, and mutation 2 has P2. Recombination would mean P = P1 + P2 - R*P, where R is the recombination fraction.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe a simpler model: Each mutation type produces a certain number of plasmids. If they don't recombine, their plasmids are additive. If they do recombine, the plasmids are shared.\n\nThe exact calculation might involve solving for R such that the observed distribution matches the expected.\n\nBut without getting too deep into the math, I recall that in such experiments, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is inversely related to the square of the recombination frequency. For example, if R=0.1, about 1% of plasmids are recombinant. But in this case, we're looking at the number of survivors, not the plasmid count.\n\nHowever, the key insight is that the presence of a significant number of plasmids and the resulting differences in survivor numbers indicate high recombination. Given the options provided, 1-2 percent seem plausible, but I need to choose the correct one.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices include letters like G (0.5%) and D (0.02%). Considering that the difference is quite large (from 10^5 to 10^7 dilution), which implies that the plasmid concentrations are drastically differing between the two groups. High recombination would allow for more mixing, leading to a larger number of cells with unique plasmids, thus more variability in survivor counts.\n\nTherefore, a moderate level of recombination, around 1-2%, fits the scenario. Among the options, G (0.5%) and C (1.5%) are close. However, considering the drastic dilution ratios, which imply a high degree of mixing, 1.5% seems more appropriate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

If there's recombination, plasmids from one host can mix with those from another. In this case, if the two mutations cause recombination, each phage would produce a unique version of the phage DNA, allowing for independent replication and potential for horizontal gene transfer.\n\nThe key here is determining how much recombination occurs between the two mutations. The formula used for recombinant frequency (RF) is typically RF = (p * q + r * s - p * q * r * s)/(1 - p * q * r * s)), where p and q are probabilities of recombination in each parent, and r and s in the offspring. However, since we're dealing with binary outcomes (either recombined or not), maybe a simpler approach applies.\n\nAnother approach is using the equation for the expected number of recombinants. The probability of recombination occurring at a specific site is often given as R. If the observed recombination rate matches what would be expected under different scenarios (like no recombination, full recombination), we can solve for R.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, the presence of a significant number of plasmids suggests that the two mutation strains have mixed. Since the population was split into two groups with different dilutions, the mixing would depend on the relative proportions of the two mutation strains.\n\nWait, the problem states that only strain B survives when both mutation types are present. So, the initial infection leads to a mixture where some cells may have plasmids from either mutation type. After selection, only some cells (those with the right combination of mutations) survive.\n\nWhen the first group is plated on strain B's lawn, their low plasmid concentration means that any new phage replication must rely on existing plasmids. If there's recombination, each phage would have its own unique DNA, making replication harder. This could lead to fewer surviving cells upon selection, explaining why only some cells survived.\n\nSimilarly, the second group with higher plasmid concentration might replicate more easily, leading to more survival on strain K's lawn. But the exact numbers are 40 on B and 4 on K. That seems like a lot of variation, suggesting significant recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination fraction, I think the formula is RF = [ (p + q)^2 - p^2 - q^2 ] / 1, where p and q are the probabilities of recombination in each direction. Alternatively, sometimes RF is expressed as (pq + qp)/1, assuming no interference. But perhaps a better way is to use the formula for the proportion of recombinant individuals.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two mutation types must have mixed, the expected number of recombinants can help determine the frequency. If all were non-recombining, the number of survivors would be less than expected. With some recombination, more survivors occur.\n\nGiven that only a small number survived on strain K (4) compared to B (40), it indicates that most plasmids came from the other strain. This suggests high recombination. \n\nBut let's get back to the math. Suppose the frequency of recombination is R. Then the probability that a cell has a plasmid from either mutation depends on whether R is greater than 0.5. If R > 0.5, the majority come from one mutation; otherwise, it's split.\n\nIf the two mutations have an equal chance of being inherited, then the expected number of recombinants would depend on R. The observed numbers suggest that recombination is likely. Let's consider that the actual number of recombinants is proportional to R.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of recombinants can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinants = n * (R * (1 - R))\n\nWhere n is the total number of cells, and R is the recombination frequency. But without knowing n, this isn't directly applicable.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both mutation types are present, the chance that a cell has both mutations (recombination) is R. Therefore, the fraction of cells with recombination is R.\n\nFrom the experiment, when the population is split into two groups, the number of plasmids determines whether a cell survives. On strain B, cells with recombination would require a certain number of plasmids to replicate successfully. Similarly, on strain K, the same logic applies.\n\nSince only 40% of the population survived on B, and 10% on K, this suggests that recombination is significant. To find the exact value, we might set up equations based on the plasmid counts.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that each mutation type contributes a certain number of plasmids. If recombination occurs, each phage will have a unique combination. Without recombination, they share the same plasmid.\n\nSuppose the original strain B has a certain number of plasmids, say P. When a phage carries mutation 1, it has P1 plasmids, and mutation 2 has P2. Recombination would mean P = P1 + P2 - R*P, where R is the recombination fraction.\n\nWait, that might complicate things. Maybe a simpler model: Each mutation type produces a certain number of plasmids. If they don't recombine, their plasmids are additive. If they do recombine, the plasmids are shared.\n\nThe exact calculation might involve solving for R such that the observed distribution matches the expected.\n\nBut without getting too deep into the math, I recall that in such experiments, the percentage of recombinant plasmids is inversely related to the square of the recombination frequency. For example, if R=0.1, about 1% of plasmids are recombinant. But in this case, we're looking at the number of survivors, not the plasmid count.\n\nHowever, the key insight is that the presence of a significant number of plasmids and the resulting differences in survivor numbers indicate high recombination. Given the options provided, 1-2 percent seem plausible, but I need to choose the correct one.\n\nLooking back, the answer choices include letters like G (0.5%) and D (0.02%). Considering that the difference is quite large (from 10^5 to 10^7 dilution), which implies that the plasmid concentrations are drastically differing between the two groups. High recombination would allow for more mixing, leading to a larger number of cells with unique plasmids, thus more variability in survivor counts.\n\nTherefore, a moderate level of recombination, around 1-2%, fits the scenario. Among the options, G (0.5%) and C (1.5%) are close. However, considering the drastic dilution ratios, which imply a high degree of mixing, 1.5% seems more appropriate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

Wait, no\u2014actually, each phage is a mutant, right? So perhaps both are from different mutants: one is from a lysogenic phage that's mutated, and the other is a lysogenically wild-type phage? Or maybe one is lysogenic and the other is neutral. Hmm, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me read again. It says \"two types of mutantphage simultaneously.\" One causes lytic in strain B but not K. The other might be similar or different. Actually, the first part says one causes lytic in B but not K. Maybe the second mutant is a neutral phage that doesn't cause any effect when mixed with B. Or perhaps the second is another type, like lysogenic but also non-lethal.\n\nBut wait, the first mutant is causing lytic in B but not in K. That suggests that when you mix the two mutant groups, some cells die because of the lysogenic phage, while others don't. So perhaps the first group (mutant A) leads to death in B but not in K, meaning that mutation A is lethal in K. But how does this relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to whether the two mutations are on the same gene and if their effects are additive. If they are recombined, then the resulting plasmid has two copies of the mutated genes, which would lead to lethality when the cells are exposed to them.\n\nIn the experiment, the initial plate has E. coli strain B infected by two mutant phages. Half of them dies due to the lysogenic phage. Then, half is further diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, giving four pluses. Similarly, the other half is plated on strain K's lawn, giving four pluses as well.\n\nWait, actually, the process is more like: First, infect strain B with two mutant phages at equal concentrations. Some cells die because the lysogenic phage is present. Then, the remaining cells are further treated with a high concentration (1:10^7) of a neutral phage, so those dead cells are unaffected. These are then plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in four pluses (so 16 surviving cells).\n\nThen, the remaining half is plated on strain K. They got four pluses here too. Now, we need to find out how many recombined mutations are present.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes:\n\nIf the two mutations are on the same gene and recombine, then the resulting phage will have a double mutant version. However, since the lysogenic phage usually doesn't cause death upon replication, unless it's recombined, it should still replicate. But if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage could become a double mutant, which may not replicate or even die.\n\nWait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage is typically non-lethal because it doesn't lyse the bacterial cell. So if the lysogenic phage has a mutation that allows it to replicate, but the neutral phage doesn't affect it, then recombination would produce a double mutant. However, the lysogenic phage shouldn't die; instead, it might cause lethality if the mutation makes it unable to replicate.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage is recombined into a double mutant, the lysogenic phage itself might lose its ability to replicate, leading to lethality.\n\nGiven that in the experiment, when the lysogenic phage was plated on strain B's lawn, four pluses appeared, suggesting that the lysogenic phage caused death in these cells. This implies that the lysogenic phage can replicate without issues, which contradicts my earlier thought. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that prevents it from replicating properly, perhaps through recombination.\n\nSo, if the lysogenic phage has a recombination mutation, then it cannot replicate, causing lethality. In the first experiment, when the lysogenic phage is mixed with strain B, only the cells that lost the lysogenic phage live, implying that the lysogenic phage had a mutation preventing replication. Then, when the remaining cells are treated with a neutral phage and plated on strain B, only four pluses appear, meaning that four cells died. Wait, no\u2014if the lysogenic phage didn't replicate, then all the cells would be killed, but the experiment shows four pluses, so presumably, the lysogenic phage did replicate, but the recombination allowed it to function properly.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Let me consider the standard approach for such experiments. Typically, when a lysogenic phage is present, it can kill the bacteria if it's defective. If it's recombined with a neutral phage, it becomes a double mutant, which can sometimes replicate but may lack the lysogenic capability. However, in the case where the lysogenic phage can still replicate, then the presence of recombination wouldn't kill the bacteria.\n\nWait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage does not cause lytic fission in strain K. So, perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that prevents it from replicating when present in combination with the lysogenically wild-type phage. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage is recombined with a neutral phage, it might become a double mutant that doesn't replicate, thus causing lethality.\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is mixed with strain B, only the lysogenic phage-infected cells die. Then, when the remaining cells are treated with a neutral phage and plated on strain B, four pluses appear. This suggests that the lysogenic phage must have been recombining into a double mutant, otherwise, the neutral phage treatment would not kill the cells, and they would survive.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage has a recombination mutation, meaning that the two mutations are on the same gene and recombine. Now, to determine the percentage of recombination, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage of Recombination = [(Number of Plated Cells Where Both Mutations Are Present) / Total Number Plated] * 100\n\nFrom the data:\n- When the lysogenic phage was plated on strain B, four pluses were seen. Since the lysogenic phage can only cause death via recombination, these four pluses correspond to cells where the lysogenic phage has lost both mutations.\n- When the lysogenic phage was plated on strain K, four pluses were also seen. Similarly, these correspond to cells where the lysogenic phage has lost both mutations.\n\nHowever, this seems conflicting because if the lysogenic phage has recombined, both plates should show the same number of pluses. Instead, one plate shows four pluses, and the other shows four pluses, but perhaps the numbers indicate something else.\n\nWait, no\u2014it depends on the dilution. When the lysogenic phage is plated on strain B, the number of cells is higher because the cells are diluted 1:10^7. Similarly, when plated on strain K, the number is lower because it's diluted less. But the observed pluses are four in each case. \n\nThis suggests that the proportion of recombined lysogenic phages is such that both dilutions result in four pluses. However, the exact calculation requires knowing the expected number of pluses based on recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possibility that only a certain fraction of the lysogenic phages have recombined, leading to lethality. When plated on strain B, the number of pluses corresponds to the cells where the lysogenic phage is fully recombined (both mutations lost), whereas when plated on strain K, the same applies.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me try another angle. The key is that recombination reduces the likelihood of lethality. If the lysogenic phage has a recombination mutation, then the lysogenic phage can't replicate, causing lethality. Without recombination, it can replicate and cause death.\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is mixed with strain B, four pluses are seen, indicating that the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate because of recombination. When the lysogenic phage is mixed with strain K, four pluses are seen as well, but perhaps the number represents the proportion of cells where the lysogenic phage lost both mutations.\n\nWait, but the numbers are low. When plated on strain B, four pluses out of 1000 cells (assuming 1:10^7 dilution means 1e7 cells per microliter, but the numbers given seem smaller). But the actual counts aren't provided, so perhaps it's better to focus on the fact that the lysogenic phage must have lost both mutations, indicating recombination.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If the lysogenic phage has a recombination mutation, then the chance of losing both mutations is related to the number of times it was recombined.\n\nAssuming that the probability of a recombination event is p, then the expected number of cells where both mutations are lost is (1 - p)^2 multiplied by the total number of cells. However, in reality, the observed number of pluses depends on the frequency of recombination events during replication.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the number of pluses. If four pluses were observed on strain B, this suggests that a small fraction of the lysogenic phages were fully recombined, meaning that the recombination occurred in fewer than half of the cases.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency (f):\n\nf = sqrt(p)\n\nwhere p is the probability of a recombination event per replication. However, this assumes random mating, but in reality, the distribution isn't perfectly random.\n\nAlternatively, the number of pluses can be used to estimate the recombination frequency. For instance, if you expect X pluses, you can solve for f.\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler. If four pluses were observed on both strains, it suggests that a small fraction of the lysogenic phages were fully recombined, meaning that the recombination frequency is low.\n\nLooking at the options, the lowest recombination frequency mentioned is 0.02%, which is option J. However, that seems very low. More likely, the answer is around 1% or 2%.\n\nWait, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. Each mutation is on a separate gene, so the recombination frequency would represent the likelihood that both mutations occur in the same copy during replication.\n\nIf the recombination happened in a quarter of the cases, the frequency would be 25%. But none of the options go beyond 0.5%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that when the lysogenic phage is mixed with strain B, four pluses are seen, indicating that the lysogenic phage lost both mutations. Similarly, when mixed with strain K, four pluses are seen, but since K doesn't have the mutation, perhaps it's just the full recombination.\n\nWait, no\u2014strain K doesn't have the mutation, so the lysogenic phage must have recombined completely to cause death. But why four pluses on both strains?\n\nPerhaps the number of pluses relates to the number of cells where both mutations are present, i.e., cells that underwent complete recombination.\n\nIn that case, if four pluses were seen on both strains, assuming the total number of cells after dilution, say N, then the expected number of pluses would be (p)^2 * N, where p is the probability of recombination in each cell.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to compute. However, the options suggest that the percentage is relatively low, probably around 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options include 0.02%, 0.05%, etc. Perhaps the correct answer is D, 0.1 percent, or F, 0.3 percent.\n\nTo make an educated guess, the recombination frequency would depend on how often the lysogenic phage successfully lost both mutations. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells after dilution is large, then the recombination frequency would be low, around 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way is to consider that the number of pluses relates to the square root of the dilution factor. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 1:10^7 dilution, the expected number of pluses would be proportional to (1/\u221a(10^7))\u00b2, which is (1/10000)\u00b2 = 1e-8, which is negligible. That doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of pluses is (recombination rate)^2 * total cells. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total cells are, say, 10,000, then (recombination rate)^2 \u2248 4/10,000 = 0.0004, so recombination rate is \u221a0.0004 = 0.02, which is 2%. But 2% isn't one of the options. The closest is E, 0.02%, which is 0.0002, and F, 0.05% (0.0005). Hmm, 2% would correspond to a recombination rate of 0.02, which is option J (0.02%), but that's not among the choices. Wait, the options go up to 5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells is 10^4, then the expected number of pluses is (recombination rate)^2 * 10^4 = 4, so (recombination rate)^2 = 4/10^4 = 0.0004, so recombination rate is 0.02. But 0.02 isn't an option. The closest is option G, 0.5%, which is 0.005, but that's higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated differently. Maybe it's the number of recombined cells over the total number of cells. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells is 10^4, then the number of recombined cells would be 4 * 2 = 8 (since four pluses on each strain), but that doesn't directly give the frequency.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so perhaps I'll conclude that the correct answer is B, 2 percent, based on my reasoning above, although I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, C, 1.5%, or H, 5%. Given that the recombination frequency is low, perhaps it's closer to 0.05%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Similarly, when mixed with strain K, four pluses are seen, but since K doesn't have the mutation, perhaps it's just the full recombination.\n\nWait, no\u2014strain K doesn't have the mutation, so the lysogenic phage must have recombined completely to cause death. But why four pluses on both strains?\n\nPerhaps the number of pluses relates to the number of cells where both mutations are present, i.e., cells that underwent complete recombination.\n\nIn that case, if four pluses were seen on both strains, assuming the total number of cells after dilution, say N, then the expected number of pluses would be (p)^2 * N, where p is the probability of recombination in each cell.\n\nBut without knowing N, it's hard to compute. However, the options suggest that the percentage is relatively low, probably around 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nWait, looking back, the options include 0.02%, 0.05%, etc. Perhaps the correct answer is D, 0.1 percent, or F, 0.3 percent.\n\nTo make an educated guess, the recombination frequency would depend on how often the lysogenic phage successfully lost both mutations. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells after dilution is large, then the recombination frequency would be low, around 0.05% or 0.1%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way is to consider that the number of pluses relates to the square root of the dilution factor. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a 1:10^7 dilution, the expected number of pluses would be proportional to (1/\u221a(10^7))\u00b2, which is (1/10000)\u00b2 = 1e-8, which is negligible. That doesn't help much.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of pluses is (recombination rate)^2 * total cells. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total cells are, say, 10,000, then (recombination rate)^2 \u2248 4/10,000 = 0.0004, so recombination rate is \u221a0.0004 = 0.02, which is 2%. But 2% isn't one of the options. The closest is E, 0.02%, which is 0.0002, and F, 0.05% (0.0005). Hmm, 2% would correspond to a recombination rate of 0.02, which is option J (0.02%), but that's not among the choices. Wait, the options go up to 5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells is 10^4, then the expected number of pluses is (recombination rate)^2 * 10^4 = 4, so (recombination rate)^2 = 4/10^4 = 0.0004, so recombination rate is 0.02. But 0.02 isn't an option. The closest is option G, 0.5%, which is 0.005, but that's higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated differently. Maybe it's the number of recombined cells over the total number of cells. If four pluses were observed on both strains, and the total number of cells is 10^4, then the number of recombined cells would be 4 * 2 = 8 (since four pluses on each strain), but that doesn't directly give the frequency.\n\nI'm getting stuck, so perhaps I'll conclude that the correct answer is B, 2 percent, based on my reasoning above, although I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, C, 1.5%, or H, 5%. Given that the recombination frequency is low, perhaps it's closer to 0.05%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half is 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After incubation, four plaques form on strain K and 40 on strain B. \n\nI remember that when you have double mutants, the number of affected plasmids depends on how much each mutation contributes. Since both mutations interfere with replication, if they're linked, their effects will be additive. If unlinked, their effects might cancel out or reinforce each other depending on the type of interference.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't affecting strain B because it's causing lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage does affect strain K. So the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B must contribute to its inability to replicate, whereas in strain K, it doesn't interfere as much? Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Strain B's lysogenic phage doesn't lyse cells, so any plasmid from it would be lost during replication. On the other hand, strain K's lysogenic phage inhibits replication but allows for some plasmid maintenance?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the lysogenic phage typically has a prophage that confers resistance to replication. So even if the lysogenic phage is present, it might still maintain some plasmid copies through the prophage. That means if both mutations are linked, the lysogenic phage might have multiple copies of the insertion sequence (I.S.) to overcome both mutations. \n\nSo let's think about the numbers. In the first half, dilution 1:10^7 was used on strain B. The number of plasmids expected without any interference would be around 10000 (since 10^7 is 1e7, and the expectation value for a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=1e-4 is roughly 1e-4, but considering the dilution, it's more like 1e-7 * 1e4 = 1e-3 plasmids per well). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the number of affected plasmids can be estimated using the formula:\n\nn = (number of plasmids per well) * (probability of duplication)\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: since only half the plate is effective against strain B, and the other half against K, we can infer the probabilities.\n\nFor strain B, half the population is resistant because only the lysogenic phage didn't lyse. For strain K, all plasmids were lost because the lysogenic phage caused replication failure. So the difference in plating efficiency suggests that the lysogenic phage can tolerate more plasmids on strain B than on K.\n\nWhen plating on strain B, only the lysogenic phage worked, so the number of plasmids in that half should correspond to the number that could survive. When plating on strain K, the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate, so any plasmids wouldn't remain, leading to no growth except those that were already lost.\n\nGiven that four plasks grew on strain K and 40 on B, perhaps the ratio tells us something about the relative plasmid densities. Let me consider the dilutions.\n\nFirst dilution (1:1e7): If n is the number of plasmids, then expected plasmids per well would be 1e-7 * n. The probability of plasmid loss due to replication is higher if the phage is lysogenic. \n\nWait, maybe the key is the number of affected plasmids at each point. Since strain B's half showed four plasks, and strain K's half had 40, perhaps the likelihood of a plasmid being maintained depends on the number of plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plasks on B to K might indicate the likelihood of plasmid maintenance. Since K's half didn't grow, it suggests that the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate, meaning they either lost all plasmids or couldn't maintain them. While B's half did grow, it suggests that some plasmids survived replication.\n\nLet me try to model it. Suppose p is the probability that a plasmid is maintained after replication. For the lysogenic phage in strain B, it must replicate successfully, so p_B = probability of successful replication. For strain K, it cannot replicate, so p_K = 0.\n\nIf both mutations are linked, the lysogenic phage would have multiple copies to overcome both. Let\u2019s say m is the number of inserted I.S. in each plasmid. Then, the probability that all m copies are lost is (1 - q)^m, where q is the probability of losing one copy. Assuming q is small, this can be approximated using the binomial theorem.\n\nHowever, since the exact calculation might be complex, perhaps we can use the fact that the number of plasks observed relates to the number of plasmids and the probability of survival.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasks on B is proportional to the square root of the number of plasmids, because the probability of a plasmid surviving replication is sqrt(p), assuming uniform loss.\n\nWait, actually, I think the number of plasks (or failed plating) follows a Poisson distribution. The expected number of plasks would be N * e^{-\u03bb}, where \u03bb is the average number of plasmids lost per well.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the probability of a plasmid surviving replication is s, then the number of plasks ( failures ) would be approximately N * (1 - s).\n\nBut since both mutations are linked, s might depend on the number of plasmids. However, without knowing s, it's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the variance between the two plating wells. If the ratio of plasks is 40 vs 4, perhaps the likelihood of replication success is inversely related. For strain B, the lysogenic phage replicated successfully, so the replication was less error-prone, allowing more plasmids to survive. For strain K, the lysogenic phage didn't replicate, so fewer plasmids remained.\n\nThus, the ratio might relate to the square of the likelihood of replication. If the replication success rate for B is r, then for K it's zero. So the ratio of plasks (40 vs 4) might be (1/r)^2. Because if replication was easier (higher r), more plasmids would survive, leading to more plasks.\n\nWait, let me see: If replication was harder (lower r), fewer plasmids survive, so fewer plasks. So if replication was easier for B, more plasmids survive, leading to more plasks. Conversely, if replication was harder for K, fewer plasmids survived.\n\nSuppose that replication was easier for B, so the replication success rate for B is r, and for K it's zero. Then the expected number of plasks on B would be proportional to (1 - r), and on K would be zero.\n\nBut in our case, K has 40 plasks and B has 4. So 4/40 = 0.1 = (1 - r), suggesting r = 0.9. So replication was 90% efficient for B.\n\nNow, since replication is influenced by the number of plasmids. Each plasmid has m I.S., and the chance of losing one per replication is q. The chance of losing all m is (1 - q)^m \u2248 1 - m*q for small q.\n\nAssuming that for B, replication succeeded with probability 0.9, and for K, it's impossible. Therefore, the probability that a plasmid survives replication in B is (1 - m*q)^{m} \u2248 e^{-m*q}. Similarly, for K, it's zero.\n\nBut given that replication was 90% efficient, we can estimate m*q = ln(1/0.9) \u2248 0.105.\n\nSo, m*q \u2248 0.105.\n\nBut without knowing m, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps an alternative approach: assume that the number of plasmids in the population is such that the number of plasks observed is proportional to the square of the number of plasmids, scaled by the replication success.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasks is proportional to the number of plasmids multiplied by the replication success squared. So, plasks \u221d m * r\u00b2.\n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio of plasks between B and K is (m * r_B\u00b2) / (m * r_K\u00b2) ) = (r_B\u00b2)/(r_K\u00b2). Since r_K = 0, this ratio would be undefined unless we consider that K's plasks are entirely due to replication failure, so perhaps plasks on K are solely due to the absence of plasmids.\n\nThis line of reasoning is getting tangled. Maybe a simpler approach: look up the formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination between two mutations in a phage.\n\nUpon recalling, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (CoC) is CoC = (planks_on_A * planks_on_B) / (expected planks on B). Here, planks_on_A is 40 (for K) and planks_on_B is 4 (for B). The expected planks on B would be based on the plasmid density and replication efficiency.\n\nBut without knowing the plasmid density, it's challenging. However, the problem states that both mutations interfere with replication. So, the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B allows it to replicate without issues, whereas in strain K, it doesn't.\n\nThus, the likelihood of replication in B is higher, implying that the lysogenic phage in B can tolerate more plasmids. This suggests that the mutations are linked, as the same plasmid copy number is maintained despite the different replication outcomes.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we need to determine the likelihood of a recombinant chromosome carrying both mutations. However, since the mutations interfere with replication, the recombinant chromosome would have both mutations, but the parent chromosomes would have none.\n\nBut the question asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, i.e., how likely it is that a single copy of the T_4 genome contains both mutations.\n\nWait, no. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. In this context, since we're dealing with a single phage, the mutations are within the phage's genome. However, the question seems to ask about the likelihood of a plasmid carrying both mutations, but the options are percentages, which don't directly map to recombination frequencies.\n\nPerhaps the question is referring to the likelihood of having a plasmid that carries both mutations, rather than the actual recombination between the phage's DNA. That makes more sense.\n\nIf that's the case, the number of plasmids in the population would influence the probability. From the data, when plated on B, 4 plasks formed, and on K, 40. Assuming that the total plasmids are the same, the plasmid density affects the number of plasks observed.\n\nLet me denote P as the probability that a plasmid is retained after replication. For B, P is high because the lysogenic phage can replicate without issues. For K, P is low or zero because the lysogenic phage cannot replicate.\n\nIf the number of plasmids per well is N, then the expected number of plasks on B would be proportional to N * P_B, and on K, it would be proportional to N * P_K.\n\nSince P_K = 0 (because lysogenic phage in K doesn't replicate), the plasks on K would be zero, but in our case, it's 40. Hmm, this contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. If replication fails, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, so any plasmids lost during replication would persist. Thus, plasks on K would be the number lost during replication plus any new plasmids introduced. But in our setup, it's just plating, not introducing new plasmids. So perhaps the initial plasmids are lost, but no new ones are added, so the plasks represent the initial loss.\n\nTherefore, if replication was easy for B, more plasmids would be lost, resulting in more plasks on B. Replication difficulty for B leads to fewer plasks on B and none on K.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of plasks (40 on K, 4 on B) implies that replication was difficult for B. Let's compute the probability of replication failure, q.\n\nThe expected number of plasks on B would be N * (1 - q), and on K, it would be N * (1 - q_K). But K's replication was zero, so plasks on K are zero. However, in our data, it's 40. This suggests that K's plasks are entirely due to the lack of plasmids, possibly because the lysogenic phage in K couldn't replicate, so any plasmids lost during replication were lost forever.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial plasmid density is the same for both strains. When plating on B, the lysogenic phage can replicate, so more plasmids survive, leading to more plasks. On K, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, so any plasmids lost during replication remain, leading to more plasks.\n\nBut according to the data, plasks on B are fewer, indicating that replication was easier for B. Therefore, q is high for B, leading to lower plasks on B.\n\nLet me calculate the probability of replication failure, q. Using the ratio of plasks: 40 on K and 4 on B.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasks on K is proportional to the number of plasmids lost, and on B proportional to the number lost plus the new plasmids gained. But without new plasmids, it's just plasmids lost.\n\nThus, plasks on B = N * (1 - q), and plasks on K = N * (1 - q_K). Since K's replication failed completely, (1 - q_K)=0, so plasks on K should be zero, but it's 40. Contradiction.\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the initial plasmid density varies. If the density is the same, then plasks on K would be due to replication failure. But with replication failure, the planks shouldn't accumulate. Instead, maybe the initial plasmids are lost, but nothing else is added, so plasks on K would just be lost. But why 40 instead of zero?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial plasmid density is higher. If the initial density is N, then planks on B would be N*(1 - q_B), and on K, it would be N*(1 - q_K). Given that q_K =0, planks on K would be N, but in reality, it's 40. So N=40.\n\nThen, planks on B would be 40*(1 - q_B) =4 \u2192 1 - q_B= 0.1 \u2192 q_B=0.9.\n\nSo replication success rate for B is 90%, and for K, it's zero.\n\nNow, the replication success rate for B being 90% implies that the probability of losing one plasmid is q= (1 - (1 - q_B))^{m} \u2248 m*q for small q.\n\nBut without knowing m, the number of plasmids per plasmid, it's hard to find the exact recombination frequency.\n\nWait, but the recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of chromosome pairs where the two loci are inherited together. But here, we're talking about a single phage's genome. Unless the question is misinterpreted, perhaps it's asking for the likelihood of the presence of both mutations in the same plasmid, which would require linked genes. If they are linked, the presence of one mutation increases the likelihood of the other.\n\nGiven that both mutations interfere with replication, they are likely to be linked. The coefficient of coincidence (CoC) is calculated as (planks_on_A * planks_on_B) / (expected planks on B). In our case, planks_on_A=40 (for K) and planks_on_B=4 (for B). Expected planks on B would be based on the plasmid density and replication efficiency.\n\nFrom above, N=40, planks_on_B=4, and q_B=0.9. So expected planks on B would be N*(1 - q_B)=40*0.1=4. Which matches our observed planks_on_B=4. So the CoC is (40*4)/4=40. Which is greater than 1, implying that the events are perfectly correlated, meaning the mutations are very likely to be linked. \n\nBut how does this translate into the recombination frequency? If the mutations are linked, the coefficient of coincidence indicates the likelihood of both occurring. However, recombination frequency is generally measured as the proportion of offspring that carry both alleles, which is unrelated to plating efficiency.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is mixing concepts. It says \"amount of recombination between the two mutations\", which is typically a measure of linkage. If the mutations are linked, the coefficient of coincidence should be close to 1. In our case, CoC=40, which is way higher than 1, indicating perfect linkage. So the recombination frequency would be very high, approaching 100%.\n\nLooking back at the options, F is 0.3% and G is 0.5%. The closest to 100% isn't listed, but the highest option is E, 0.2%. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the question intended to ask about the likelihood of a plasmid containing both mutations, which would be linked. But the options provided don't include 100%, so perhaps the answer is B, 2%, but that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is about the expected recombination frequency given the plating results. If the mutations are linked with a high degree of correlation (CoC\u224840), the recombination frequency would be nearly 100%. But again, the options don't go that high. Maybe the correct answer is B, 2%, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, going back, the plating efficiency suggests that replication was easier for B, leading to lower planks_on_B. The CoC being 40 suggests perfect linkage. But the possible answers don't have 100%. So perhaps the intended answer is B, 2%, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the relationship between Planks and recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when it infects strain K, which doesn't cause lytic fission, there's no effect. \n\nThe experiment involves two halves of a plate. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half is 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After incubation, four plaques form on strain K and 40 on strain B. \n\nI remember that when you have double mutants, the number of affected plasmids depends on how much each mutation contributes. Since both mutations interfere with replication, if they're linked, their effects will be additive. If unlinked, their effects might cancel out or reinforce each other depending on the type of interference.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't affecting strain B because it's causing lytic fission, while the lysogenic phage does affect strain K. So the presence of the lysogenic phage in strain B must contribute to its inability to replicate, whereas in strain K, it doesn't interfere as much? Or wait, maybe it's the opposite. Strain B's lysogenic phage doesn't lyse cells, so any plasmid from it would be lost during replication. On the other hand, strain K's lysogenic phage inhibits replication but allows for some plasmid maintenance?\n\nWait, no. Actually, the lysogenic phage typically has a prophage that confers resistance to replication. So even if the lysogenic phage is present, it might still maintain some plasmid copies through the prophage. That means if both mutations are linked, the lysogenic phage might have multiple copies of the insertion sequence (I.S.) to overcome both mutations. \n\nSo let's think about the numbers. In the first half, dilution 1:10^7 was used on strain B. The number of plasmids expected without any interference would be around 10000 (since 10^7 is 1e7, and the expectation value for a Poisson distribution with \u03bb=1e-4 is roughly 1e-4, but considering the dilution, it's more like 1e-7 * 1e4 = 1e-3 plasmids per well). Wait, perhaps I'm complicating it too much.\n\nAlternatively, I recall that the number of affected plasmids can be estimated using the formula:\n\nn = (number of plasmids per well) * (probability of duplication)\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe another approach: since only half the plate is effective against strain B, and the other half against K, we can infer the probabilities.\n\nFor strain B, half the population is resistant because only the lysogenic phage didn't lyse. For strain K, all plasmids were lost because the lysogenic phage caused replication failure. So the difference in plating efficiency suggests that the lysogenic phage can tolerate more plasmids on strain B than on K.\n\nWhen plating on strain B, only the lysogenic phage worked, so the number of plasmids in that half should correspond to the number that could survive. When plating on strain K, the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate, so any plasmids wouldn't remain, leading to no growth except those that were already lost.\n\nGiven that four plasks grew on strain K and 40 on B, perhaps the ratio tells us something about the relative plasmid densities. Let me consider the dilutions.\n\nFirst dilution (1:1e7): If n is the number of plasmids, then expected plasmids per well would be 1e-7 * n. The probability of plasmid loss due to replication is higher if the phage is lysogenic. \n\nWait, maybe the key is the number of affected plasmids at each point. Since strain B's half showed four plasks, and strain K's half had 40, perhaps the likelihood of a plasmid being maintained depends on the number of plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plasks on B to K might indicate the likelihood of plasmid maintenance. Since K's half didn't grow, it suggests that the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate, meaning they either lost all plasmids or couldn't maintain them. While B's half did grow, it suggests that some plasmids survived replication.\n\nLet me try to model it. Suppose p is the probability that a plasmid is maintained after replication. For the lysogenic phage in strain B, it must replicate successfully, so p_B = probability of successful replication. For strain K, it cannot replicate, so p_K = 0.\n\nIf both mutations are linked, the lysogenic phage would have multiple copies to overcome both. Let\u2019s say m is the number of inserted I.S. in each plasmid. Then, the probability that all m copies are lost is (1 - q)^m, where q is the probability of losing one copy. Assuming q is small, this can be approximated using the binomial theorem.\n\nHowever, since the exact calculation might be complex, perhaps we can use the fact that the number of plasks observed relates to the number of plasmids and the probability of survival.\n\nAssuming that the number of plasks on B is proportional to the square root of the number of plasmids, because the probability of a plasmid surviving replication is sqrt(p), assuming uniform loss.\n\nWait, actually, I think the number of plasks (or failed plating) follows a Poisson distribution. The expected number of plasks would be N * e^{-\u03bb}, where \u03bb is the average number of plasmids lost per well.\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the probability of a plasmid surviving replication is s, then the number of plasks ( failures ) would be approximately N * (1 - s).\n\nBut since both mutations are linked, s might depend on the number of plasmids. However, without knowing s, it's tricky.\n\nAnother angle: the variance between the two plating wells. If the ratio of plasks is 40 vs 4, perhaps the likelihood of replication success is inversely related. For strain B, the lysogenic phage replicated successfully, so the replication was less error-prone, allowing more plasmids to survive. For strain K, the lysogenic phage didn't replicate, so fewer plasmids remained.\n\nThus, the ratio might relate to the square of the likelihood of replication. If the replication success rate for B is r, then for K it's zero. So the ratio of plasks (40 vs 4) might be (1/r)^2. Because if replication was easier (higher r), more plasmids would survive, leading to more plasks.\n\nWait, let me see: If replication was harder (lower r), fewer plasmids survive, so fewer plasks. So if replication was easier for B, more plasmids survive, leading to more plasks. Conversely, if replication was harder for K, fewer plasmids survived.\n\nSuppose that replication was easier for B, so the replication success rate for B is r, and for K it's zero. Then the expected number of plasks on B would be proportional to (1 - r), and on K would be zero.\n\nBut in our case, K has 40 plasks and B has 4. So 4/40 = 0.1 = (1 - r), suggesting r = 0.9. So replication was 90% efficient for B.\n\nNow, since replication is influenced by the number of plasmids. Each plasmid has m I.S., and the chance of losing one per replication is q. The chance of losing all m is (1 - q)^m \u2248 1 - m*q for small q.\n\nAssuming that for B, replication succeeded with probability 0.9, and for K, it's impossible. Therefore, the probability that a plasmid survives replication in B is (1 - m*q)^{m} \u2248 e^{-m*q}. Similarly, for K, it's zero.\n\nBut given that replication was 90% efficient, we can estimate m*q = ln(1/0.9) \u2248 0.105.\n\nSo, m*q \u2248 0.105.\n\nBut without knowing m, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps an alternative approach: assume that the number of plasmids in the population is such that the number of plasks observed is proportional to the square of the number of plasmids, scaled by the replication success.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasks is proportional to the number of plasmids multiplied by the replication success squared. So, plasks \u221d m * r\u00b2.\n\nIf that's the case, then the ratio of plasks between B and K is (m * r_B\u00b2) / (m * r_K\u00b2) ) = (r_B\u00b2)/(r_K\u00b2). Since r_K = 0, this ratio would be undefined unless we consider that K's plasks are entirely due to replication failure, so perhaps plasks on K are solely due to the absence of plasmids.\n\nThis line of reasoning is getting tangled. Maybe a simpler approach: look up the formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination between two mutations in a phage.\n\nUpon recalling, the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (CoC) is CoC = (planks_on_A * planks_on_B) / (expected planks on B).

Hmm, this contradicts my earlier assumption.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. If replication fails, the lysogenic phage cannot replicate, so any plasmids lost during replication would persist.

Let's compute the probability of replication failure, q.\n\nThe expected number of plasks on B would be N * (1 - q), and on K, it would be N * (1 - q_K). But K's replication was zero, so plasks on K are zero. However, in our data, it's 40.

So N=40.\n\nThen, planks on B would be 40*(1 - q_B) =4 \u2192 1 - q_B= 0.1 \u2192 q_B=0.9.\n\nSo replication success rate for B is 90%, and for K, it's zero.\n\nNow, the replication success rate for B being 90% implies that the probability of losing one plasmid is q= (1 - (1 - q_B))^{m} \u2248 m*q for small q.\n\nBut without knowing m, the number of plasmids per plasmid, it's hard to find the exact recombination frequency.\n\nWait, but the recombination frequency is usually expressed as the percentage of chromosome pairs where the two loci are inherited together.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

One half is dilute (1:10^7), meaning fewer phages are present per well, leading to more dilution. This half is plated on strain B. The other half is also dilute but more concentrated (1:10^5), so there are more phages per well. This second sample is then plated on strain K.\n\nThe results show that four pluses are found on K, which means four colonies grew on strain K. On strain B, there are 40 pluses. So, the number of successful infections depends on the concentration of phages and their ability to cause lysogeny.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the mutations in the phages' genes have occurred during replication. If the mutations don't recombine, each phage has its own copy of the mutation. But if they do recombine, the phage carries both mutations from both host strands.\n\nSince only the lysogenic phage caused issues, any recombination would prevent it from causing lysis. However, the presence of multiple plasmids suggests that the mutations could be either recombinant or non-recombinant.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses on each strain indicates the frequency of successful infections. The lower number on K (40 vs. 4) might suggest that some of the phages were non-recombinant, as they didn't cause enough damage. Wait, actually, higher numbers mean more successful infections, so 40 on B and 4 on K\u2014so K had fewer successful infections than B. That makes sense if the phages on K had more mutations or less effective ones.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination reduces the number of cells with the mutation because the phage copies the mutation from both strands. Without recombination, you'd expect a certain distribution, while with recombination, the mutated phages would form double-stranded regions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the expected outcomes for different levels of recombination. If there was no recombination, most of the phages would have the wild-type mutation and some would have the lysogenic mutation. But since the lysogenic ones die, only the ones carrying the mutation would survive.\n\nWhen both types are present, the lysogenic phages cannot replicate, so only the non-lysed phages (the wild-type) would lead to infection. The non-lysed phages would carry the mutation from the lysogenic phage, assuming recombination happened.

In the second sample (dilute 1:10^5), it's 4. So, the ratio of pluses is 10 times lower. This implies that the concentration of phages on the K plate is 10 times higher than on B. Since the same number of phages leads to more pluses when concentrated, the higher concentration on K likely resulted from the presence of more wild-type phages, which carried the mutation due to recombination.\n\nTherefore, recombination must have occurred because otherwise, the wild-type phages wouldn't have replicated enough to cause as many pluses as observed.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. The other type doesn't affect strain B at all.\n\nNow, when both types are present, the bacteria's plates are split into two halves. One half is dilute (1:10^7), meaning fewer phages are present per well, leading to more dilution. This half is plated on strain B. The other half is also dilute but more concentrated (1:10^5), so there are more phages per well. This second sample is then plated on strain K.\n\nThe results show that four pluses are found on K, which means four colonies grew on strain K. On strain B, there are 40 pluses. So, the number of successful infections depends on the concentration of phages and their ability to cause lysogeny.\n\nRecombination refers to whether the mutations in the phages' genes have occurred during replication. If the mutations don't recombine, each phage has its own copy of the mutation. But if they do recombine, the phage carries both mutations from both host strands.\n\nSince only the lysogenic phage caused issues, any recombination would prevent it from causing lysis. However, the presence of multiple plasmids suggests that the mutations could be either recombinant or non-recombinant.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses on each strain indicates the frequency of successful infections. The lower number on K (40 vs. 4) might suggest that some of the phages were non-recombinant, as they didn't cause enough damage. Wait, actually, higher numbers mean more successful infections, so 40 on B and 4 on K\u2014so K had fewer successful infections than B. That makes sense if the phages on K had more mutations or less effective ones.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination reduces the number of cells with the mutation because the phage copies the mutation from both strands. Without recombination, you'd expect a certain distribution, while with recombination, the mutated phages would form double-stranded regions.\n\nWait, perhaps I should think about the expected outcomes for different levels of recombination. If there was no recombination, most of the phages would have the wild-type mutation and some would have the lysogenic mutation. But since the lysogenic ones die, only the ones carrying the mutation would survive.\n\nWhen both types are present, the lysogenic phages cannot replicate, so only the non-lysed phages (the wild-type) would lead to infection. The non-lysed phages would carry the mutation from the lysogenic phage, assuming recombination happened. Alternatively, without recombination, the phages would carry only one mutation.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the number of successfully induced phages would depend on the ratio of wild-type to mutant phages. Since the lysogenic phages don't replicate, only those that carry the mutation would cause lysis. The wild-type phages would still replicate, but they wouldn't cause lysis unless they have the mutation.\n\nLet me consider the formula for expected number of mutants. The probability of recombination affecting the mutation is given by the fraction of phages that have the mutation. In the absence of recombination, most phages would have the mutation, but since the lysogenic ones don't replicate, only the wild-type would cause lysis. \n\nHowever, in reality, if recombination happens, some phages would have both mutations, but since the lysogenic ones die, only the phages that have at least one mutation would cause lysis.

Half of each sample is used for strain B and half for strain K. After incubation, there are 40 pluses on strain B and 4 on strain K. Plus signs indicate successful infection without lysogeny issues.\n\nWait, no, actually, plus means successful infection, right? So 40 pluses on B mean those were successfully lysed because the lysogenic phage didn't work. And 4 pluses on K mean lysogenic phage worked, meaning there's recombination because it caused the lysogenic effect in K but not B.\n\nSo how do we calculate recombination percentage here? Recombination refers to the chance that two mutations occurred at the same site in the DNA. Since the phages have different replication strategies\u2014lytic vs. lysogenic\u2014the presence of lysogenic phages should carry their mutation from the host, while lysogenic ones don't necessarily do anything. Wait, but the phages themselves might be carrying the mutation from the host or not.\n\nBut the problem states that the lysogenic phage carries mutations in rII. The lysogenic phages typically have an integration mutation or a mutation in the leader region, allowing them to integrate into the host genome. If these mutations are present in both types of phages, then when they infect strain B, only the lysogenic phage would cause problems because they wouldn't lyse the cell. However, when tested against strain K, which doesn't lyse cells, the lysogenic phage would now cause issues if its mutation isn't present in the host.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let's think again. The lysogenic phages don't lyse cells; instead, they replicate inside the cell. The lysogenic phage in strain B causes problems because it uses the host's resources. When tested on strain K, which doesn't use resources, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause problems unless it has a mutation that allows it to replicate or integrate.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage in strain B has a mutation that confers resistance, making it ineffective in strain K. That would require that the mutation is present in both phages, leading to recombination in the host. Therefore, the presence of lysogenic phages in strain B that are resistant to strain K would imply that the mutation carried by the lysogenic phage in strain B is also present in the host. Thus, the number of pluses on strain K would indicate the fraction of lysogenic phages that have the mutation.\n\nIn the experiment, half the sample is used on strain B and half on strain K. For strain B, 40 pluses mean 80% success. For strain K, 4 pluses mean 10%. The difference suggests that about 70% of the lysogenic phages in strain B have the mutation that makes them effective against strain K. So, the recombination frequency (RF) would be approximately 70%, meaning that the mutation occurs in approximately 70% of the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, but the options given are much lower percentages. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. Perhaps the recombination refers to the probability that the mutation was present in both phages. Since only some lysogenic phages caused the issue, the RF could be calculated as the proportion of lysogenic phages that have the mutation. In this case, 4 pluses out of 50 (since half was used on each), but wait, the initial sample size wasn't specified. Let me check the description again.\n\nThe problem says that when the two samples are each split into halves, one half is used for strain B and the other for strain K. Each half is then further diluted and plated. On strain B, 40 pluses (so 80% success rate), and on strain K, 4 pluses (10% success rate). The total plasmid count per test might depend on how many phages were present, but since the problem doesn't specify, perhaps it's assumed that each half contains the same number of phages.\n\nAssuming that each half has the same number of phages, let's say N. For strain B, 40 pluses mean 40% of the phages were successful, implying that 60% had the mutation (since lysogenic phages without the mutation wouldn't lyse and would fail). For strain K, 4 pluses mean 8% success rate, implying 92% of the phages had the mutation. This discrepancy suggests that only a small fraction of lysogenic phages in strain B have the mutation, specifically around 70%.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is approximately 70%, which is closest to option F, which is 0.3 percent. Wait, that seems too high. Alternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood what recombination refers to. If recombination refers to the chance that a mutation exists in both phages, then the RF would be based on the number of lysogenic phages in strain B that have the mutation. Given that only 70% of the lysogenic phages in strain B have the mutation, the RF is 70%.\n\nLooking back at the answer options, none directly match 70%. The closest higher option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the ratio of pluses. Strain B has 40 pluses, and strain K has 4. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that 9/10 of the lysogenic phages in strain B have the mutation. So 90% of the phages in strain B have the mutation, whereas only 10% in strain K. Therefore, the RF would be 90%, which is still not among the options provided. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me try another approach. If 4 pluses on strain K correspond to the fraction of lysogenic phages in strain B that have the mutation, and assuming each half contains the same number of phages, let's denote N as the number of phages in each half. Then:\n\nFor strain B:\nNumber of pluses = 40% of N = 0.4N\nThus, number of non-plus phages = 0.6N\n\nFor strain K:\nNumber of pluses = 10% of N = 0.1N\nThus, number of non-plus phages = 0.9N\n\nIf all non-plush phages in strain B are the same as those in strain K, then the number of phages with the mutation in strain B must equal that in strain K. But in reality, the phages may come from the same source, so the mutation is present in the host genome. Therefore, the fraction of phages with the mutation in strain B is 0.4N / N = 0.4, meaning 40% have the mutation. In strain K, it's 0.1N / N = 0.1, 10% have the mutation. Therefore, the RF is (number of phages with mutation in strain B - number with mutation in strain K) / total phages with mutation?\n\nWait, no, perhaps the RF is the probability that a randomly chosen phage from strain B has the mutation, compared to strain K. So RF would be 0.4 / 0.1 = 4, which is 400%. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the RF is the relative frequency of the mutation in the host genome, considering the two samples.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to compute the expected number of pluses if there were no recombination. Without recombination, all lysogenic phages would have been effective in both strains, so the number of pluses on both strains would be similar. With recombination, some lysogenic phages would lack the mutation, thus failing in both strains.\n\nGiven that in strain B, 40 pluses, and in strain K, 4 pluses, the difference suggests that a significant portion of lysogenic phages lost the mutation upon being exposed to strain K.\n\nLet me model this. Suppose x is the fraction of lysogenic phages in strain B that have the mutation. Then, in strain K, only (x - y) would retain the mutation, where y is the fraction that remain active. If we assume that the mutation is lost in all lysogenic phages upon exposure to strain K, then in strain K, the fraction of phages with the mutation would be (1 - y).\n\nFrom the data, in strain B, 40% of phages are successful, so x = 0.4. In strain K, 10% of phages are successful, so 1 - y = 0.1 \u2192 y = 0.9. Therefore, the fraction of phages with the mutation in strain B is x = 0.4, and in strain K, it's y = 0.9. Wait, that doesn't add up because if all lysogenic phages lose the mutation, then in strain K, all would have the mutation, but in our case, only 10% are successful, meaning 90% lost the mutation. So the RF is 0.4 (strain B) versus 0.9 (strain K). But RF is usually expressed as the chance that a mutation exists in the host, so perhaps the RF is (x + (1 - y)) / 2? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the RF could refer to the proportion of phages with the mutation in strain B compared to strain K. So RF = x / (1 - y) = 0.4 / 0.9 \u2248 0.444, which is approximately 44.4%. Still not matching any answer choices.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to calculate the likelihood of recombination based on the observed plasmids. If 40 pluses on B and 4 on K suggest that 75% of the lysogenic phages in B have the mutation, and only 10% in K, then the RF is 75%, which is not an option either.\n\nWait, looking at the answer options, the highest is H (5%), followed by G (0.5%) and J (0.05%). Maybe I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the presence of a mutation in both phages. Since only lysogenic phages carry the mutation, the recombination would occur if the mutation was present in both phages. If the mutation was lost in one but retained in the other, that indicates that the mutation was present in the host genome.\n\nBut according to the data, strain B shows that the lysogenic phages cause issues, while strain K doesn't. So the mutation must be present in the host. Now, the recombination frequency would relate to how often a mutation occurs in the host genome. If the mutation was introduced during replication, it's possible that both phages have the mutation, leading to full activity, hence more plasmids. But in this case, both phages carry the mutation, so they should work together.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the likelihood that a mutation occurred in both phages. Since the lysogenic phage in B causes issues, and the lysogenic in K doesn't, that implies that the mutation was present in the host. Therefore, the recombination frequency would reflect whether the mutation was present in both phages.\n\nHowever, the experiment doesn't show any recombination because both phages carry the mutation. Therefore, the recombination frequency should be very low, close to zero, indicating that the mutation was present in the host genome. But the options don't include a value near zero. The closest is D (0.1%).\n\nWait, but the options are letters, not percentages. The user probably expects an approximate value. If the recombination frequency is the chance that the mutation arose in the host, and given that both phages have the mutation, the RF is minimal. However, the data suggests that the mutation was already present in the host, so the RF is effectively zero. But the options don't go below 0.05%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of plasmids. If 40 plasmids are formed in B and 4 in K, the ratio suggests that the lysogenic phages in B had a 75% chance of having the mutation, while in K, only 10% did. This inconsistency suggests that the mutation was lost upon exposure to strain K, implying that the mutation was present in the host but not in the lysogenic phages in K. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be the chance that a lysogenic phage in B has the mutation, minus the chance that a lysogenic phage in K retains the mutation. But I'm not sure how to translate this into a RF.\n\nAnother angle: The presence of lysogenic phages in B causing issues suggests that the lysogenic phage carries the mutation, which is why it doesn't lyse the cell. When tested against strain K, which doesn't lyse, the lysogenic phage loses the mutation, resulting in failure. Therefore, the mutation must exist in the host. To find the recombination frequency, we compare the probabilities of the mutation existing in the host versus in the phages. Since both phages have the mutation, the RF is determined by the likelihood that the mutation was present in the host, which is likely very low, approaching zero. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nMaybe the question is simpler than I'm making it. The lysogenic phage in B causes issues, while the lysogenic in K doesn't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage in B has a mutation that the K phage lacks. The number of plasmids formed tells us about the efficiency of the lysogenic replication. If 40 plasmids form on B and 4 on K, it implies that most of the lysogenic phages in B successfully replicated, but fewer in K. The ratio suggests that the lysogenic phages in B are more likely to have the mutation.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can consider the number of plasmids. If the mutation is present in the host, then the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the number of phages with the mutation. However, without knowing the exact distribution, it's challenging. Given the options, the closest is C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering that only a small fraction of lysogenic phages in B have the mutation, and a larger fraction in K, perhaps the RF is around 0.3%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

In strain K, 10% of phages are successful, so 1 - y = 0.1 \u2192 y = 0.9. Therefore, the fraction of phages with the mutation in strain B is x = 0.4, and in strain K, it's y = 0.9. Wait, that doesn't add up because if all lysogenic phages lose the mutation, then in strain K, all would have the mutation, but in our case, only 10% are successful, meaning 90% lost the mutation. So the RF is 0.4 (strain B) versus 0.9 (strain K). But RF is usually expressed as the chance that a mutation exists in the host, so perhaps the RF is (x + (1 - y)) / 2? No, that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, the RF could refer to the proportion of phages with the mutation in strain B compared to strain K. So RF = x / (1 - y) = 0.4 / 0.9 \u2248 0.444, which is approximately 44.4%. Still not matching any answer choices.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Another approach is to calculate the likelihood of recombination based on the observed plasmids. If 40 pluses on B and 4 on K suggest that 75% of the lysogenic phages in B have the mutation, and only 10% in K, then the RF is 75%, which is not an option either.\n\nWait, looking at the answer options, the highest is H (5%), followed by G (0.5%) and J (0.05%). Maybe I misinterpreted the question. It asks for the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Recombination refers to the presence of a mutation in both phages. Since only lysogenic phages carry the mutation, the recombination would occur if the mutation was present in both phages. If the mutation was lost in one but retained in the other, that indicates that the mutation was present in the host genome.\n\nBut according to the data, strain B shows that the lysogenic phages cause issues, while strain K doesn't. So the mutation must be present in the host. Now, the recombination frequency would relate to how often a mutation occurs in the host genome. If the mutation was introduced during replication, it's possible that both phages have the mutation, leading to full activity, hence more plasmids. But in this case, both phages carry the mutation, so they should work together.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the likelihood that a mutation occurred in both phages. Since the lysogenic phage in B causes issues, and the lysogenic in K doesn't, that implies that the mutation was present in the host. Therefore, the recombination frequency would reflect whether the mutation was present in both phages.\n\nHowever, the experiment doesn't show any recombination because both phages carry the mutation. Therefore, the recombination frequency should be very low, close to zero, indicating that the mutation was present in the host genome. But the options don't include a value near zero. The closest is D (0.1%).\n\nWait, but the options are letters, not percentages. The user probably expects an approximate value. If the recombination frequency is the chance that the mutation arose in the host, and given that both phages have the mutation, the RF is minimal. However, the data suggests that the mutation was already present in the host, so the RF is effectively zero. But the options don't go below 0.05%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the number of plasmids. If 40 plasmids are formed in B and 4 in K, the ratio suggests that the lysogenic phages in B had a 75% chance of having the mutation, while in K, only 10% did. This inconsistency suggests that the mutation was lost upon exposure to strain K, implying that the mutation was present in the host but not in the lysogenic phages in K. Therefore, the recombination frequency would be the chance that a lysogenic phage in B has the mutation, minus the chance that a lysogenic phage in K retains the mutation. But I'm not sure how to translate this into a RF.\n\nAnother angle: The presence of lysogenic phages in B causing issues suggests that the lysogenic phage carries the mutation, which is why it doesn't lyse the cell. When tested against strain K, which doesn't lyse, the lysogenic phage loses the mutation, resulting in failure. Therefore, the mutation must exist in the host. To find the recombination frequency, we compare the probabilities of the mutation existing in the host versus in the phages. Since both phages have the mutation, the RF is determined by the likelihood that the mutation was present in the host, which is likely very low, approaching zero. However, the options don't reflect this.\n\nMaybe the question is simpler than I'm making it. The lysogenic phage in B causes issues, while the lysogenic in K doesn't. This suggests that the lysogenic phage in B has a mutation that the K phage lacks. The number of plasmids formed tells us about the efficiency of the lysogenic replication. If 40 plasmids form on B and 4 on K, it implies that most of the lysogenic phages in B successfully replicated, but fewer in K. The ratio suggests that the lysogenic phages in B are more likely to have the mutation.\n\nTo estimate recombination frequency, we can consider the number of plasmids. If the mutation is present in the host, then the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the number of phages with the mutation. However, without knowing the exact distribution, it's challenging. Given the options, the closest is C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering that only a small fraction of lysogenic phages in B have the mutation, and a larger fraction in K, perhaps the RF is around 0.3%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So, how does this relate to recombination?\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of genetic information during replication. If there's recombination, then the alleles at the same locus will be passed on together from parent to offspring. In the context of phages, if a mutation arises from recombination, the resultant phage may have an altered fitness compared to non-recombined mutants.\n\nIn the experiment, the lysogenic phage (which is good for B) is causing issues, so perhaps it has a recombined mutation. The other phage (lytic, which isn't bad for B) might not cause issues because it doesn't replicate. When both are present, the lysogenic phage can take over B, leading to its death, whereas the lysogenic phage in the other group doesn't affect B.\n\nNow, the number of pluses depends on whether the mutation caused by recombination allows the phage to survive. If the recombination leads to a mutant that still allows the phage to replicate (i.e., it's functional), then it would die; otherwise, it would reproduce. \n\nLooking at the data:\n- Half with 1:10^7 dilution (probably meaning the phage hasn't replicated enough yet) plates on B lawn. Resulting in 4 pluses.\n- Half with 1:10^5 dilution plates on K lawn, resulting in 40 pluses.\n\nAssuming that recombination allows the lysogenic phage to survive on B, then the presence of pluses indicates that these mutants can replicate on B. However, if the lysogenic phage cannot replicate due to recombination disrupting its ability to integrate or replicate, then those pluses wouldn't show up on B.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage was shown to cause issues on B, it suggests that the mutation allows the phage to replicate despite the presence of the lysogenic phage. Therefore, the lysogenic phage must carry a recombined mutation that makes it viable on B.\n\nGiven that, when both types of mutants are present, the lysogenic phage (good for B) should dominate.

The ratio of plasmids in the B half to the K half is 1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5, which simplifies to 10^2:1, or 100:1. This means that the plasmids in the B half are 100 times less likely to replicate successfully compared to the K half.\n\nSince plasmid copy number correlates with fitness, a 100:1 ratio corresponds to a log(100) = 2-fold reduction in fitness.

    "rollout": " But when the same phage infects strain K, which isn't as sensitive, neither mutation works, meaning both plasmids stay intact. \n\nThe experiment involved dividing the bacteria into two groups: one that was treated with a dilution ratio of 1:10^7 and another with 1:10^5. The group with the higher dilution (1:10^7) led to a division where half were lysed, and half survived. The other group with 1:10^5 had fewer survivors, only four on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so the idea here is about recombination rates. Recombination refers to how often two different alleles from two parent lines combine into a new allele. In phages, this would mean how likely it is for two mutations in different phages to end up together in the offspring phage.\n\nWhen the phage with lysogenic replication (which doesn't lyse cells) infects strain B, it doesn't cause any issue because it's already lysogenic. So all of strain B should survive. However, when it infects strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, the lysogenic phage from strain B becomes integrated into the K phage's genome. This integration is the recombination event we're measuring.\n\nNow, looking at the results. The half that survived (from 1:10^7 dilution) showed that some cells died. Since strain K wasn't affected, those that didn't die must have lost their lysogenic phage integration. On the other hand, the lower dilution group (1:10^5) shows more death, indicating stronger recombination. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, I think we look at the difference in survival rates. The higher dilution group (1:10^7) has a certain survival rate, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) has a slightly lower rate. The difference in these survival rates gives us an estimate of the number of recombinant plasmids present in each group. \n\nIn experiments like this, the difference in survival rates is typically used to calculate the recombination frequency or rate. The formula might involve subtracting the survival rates and then converting that difference into a percentage. For example, if the higher dilution group has 60% survival and the lower has 50%, the difference suggests 10% recombination. \n\nLooking at the data provided, the higher dilution group (1:10^7) resulted in 50% survival, and the lower (1:10^5) had 40%. Wait, no, actually, the problem states that half the cells died in the 1:10^7 group, meaning 50% survived, and the other half survived 50% of the time? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So half the plates (from 1:10^7 dilution) had the expected outcome, and the other half didn't. That suggests that the phage without lysogenic replication (strain B) caused the issue in the first half, while the phage with lysogenic replication (strain K) did not affect the second half. \n\nBut wait, the phage that causes lysogenic replication isn't always effective against strain K because the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into K's genome. So the presence of the lysogenic phage in K means that the integration occurs, reducing the probability of the lysogenic phage causing issues. Therefore, when the phage with lysogenic replication is mixed with strain K, it leads to less death than when it's alone in strain B.\n\nSo, the key point is that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain B reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage in strain K. The recombination rate (R) can be estimated using the equation R = (p - q), where p is the proportion of cells that died in the higher dilution group (strain B, 1:10^7) and q is the proportion in the lower group (strain K, 1:10^5).\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Higher dilution (1:10^7): 50% died \u2192 p = 0.5\n- Lower dilution (1:10^5): 50% died \u2192 q = 0.5 (since only four out of 1000 are dead; wait, no, the numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. But since each plate is half the original population, perhaps the numbers represent counts.)\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strainB. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strainK.\"\n\nSo, each group has 50% of the original population. For the 1:10^7 group, 50% of them died, meaning 50% of the 50% survived, so 25% of the original population survived. Similarly, for the 1:10^5 group, 50% died, so 25% survived. But the problem says 4 on K and 40 on B. Hmm, that seems conflicting unless the numbers refer to the total surviving or something else. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution group has a 50% kill rate, and the low dilution group has a 50% kill rate as well, but the integration (recombination) affects the low dilution group more. The result is that on the high dilution, 50% killed, on low dilution, 50% killed as well, but the recombination makes the low dilution more resistant, leading to fewer kills. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, F = (p - q)/1, assuming p > q. Here, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, so F = 0, which implies 0% recombination. But that contradicts the options given, so maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Alternatively, the recombination rate R can be calculated as R = 1 / log(D), where D is the dilution factor. \n\nWait, let's try that. If the recombination rate is R, then R = 1 / log(D), where D is the dilution factor. For the high dilution group (1:10^7), D = 1e7. So R = 1 / log(1e7). Assuming base 10 logarithm, log(1e7) = 7, so R = 1/7 \u2248 0.1428, or 14.28% per generation. But that's too high compared to the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logarithm: ln(1e7) \u2248 16.118, so R \u2248 1/16.118 \u2248 6.2%.\n\nStill too high. Maybe the correct formula is R = (p - q)/(p + q). From the data, p = 0.5 (higher dilution group died 50%), q = 0.5 (lower died 50%). So R = (0.5 - 0.5)/(0.5 + 0.5) = 0/1 = 0%. Still zero.\n\nThis suggests that there's no recombination, which isn't among the options except option H (5%) and others. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K leads to the integration of its DNA into the phage's genome, reducing the likelihood of the lysogenic phage causing issues. The difference in the number of plasmid loss in the two groups indicates the degree of recombination. \n\nGiven that the higher dilution group (1:1e7) shows 50% death, and the lower (1:1e5) also shows 50% death, but due to recombination, the lower dilution group is more resistant. The calculation might involve taking the reciprocal of the dilution factor. Alternatively, the recombination rate R can be approximated as 1 / (log(D)), where D is the dilution factor.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The effect of recombination is such that the recombination frequency is inversely related to the dilution factor. For instance, at higher dilutions, the effects are smaller, implying lower recombination rates. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then R = 1 / log(D). For D=1e7, R\u22481/7\u224814.28%. But none of the options match this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid losses can indicate the level of integration. The higher dilution group (more plasmids) shows more plasmid loss, suggesting lower recombination, while the lower dilution group (fewer plasmids) shows less loss, suggesting higher recombination. \n\nBut according to the problem, both groups show similar death rates, which might suggest a low recombination rate. However, the answer options don't include 0%, but rather 0.02%, 0.05%, etc. Perhaps the calculation involves comparing the survival rates directly.\n\nThe higher dilution group (1:1e7) has a 50% survival rate, and the lower (1:1e5) also has 50% survival. But in reality, the lower group should have a lower survival rate because recombination has increased the likelihood of losing the lysogenic phage. \n\nAssuming that the survival rates are inversely proportional to the dilution factor, but scaled by the recombination rate. The formula could be S_high = S_low * (1 - R), where S is survival and R is recombination rate. \n\nIf S_high = 0.5, S_low = 0.5*(1 - R). Solving for R: R = (1 - S_low/S_high). If S_high = 0.5, S_low = 0.5*(1 - R). Then R = (1 - 0.5)/0.5 = 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe a better way is to consider the ratio of survival rates. If the survival rates are inversely proportional to the dilution factors adjusted by the recombination rate, then:\n\nS_high = S_low * (1 - R) * (D_high / D_low)\n\nWhere D_high = 1e7, D_low = 1e5. So,\n\n0.5 = 0.5 * (1 - R) * (1e7 / 1e5)\n0.5 = 0.5 * (1 - R) * 100\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n1 = (1 - R)*100\nDivide both sides by 100:\n0.01 = 1 - R\nThus, R = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99, which is 99%, way too high.\n\nClearly, this approach is flawed. Maybe I should look for a different method. \n\nAnother possibility: The number of recombinants observed is equal to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If both mutations are rare, the probability of recombination is approximately equal to the sum of their frequencies. But since the problem states that the recombination is measured between the two mutations, the percentage would correspond to the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual frequencies of each mutation, it's hard to apply this directly. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may assume that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. For example, at higher dilutions (smaller fractions remaining), recombination is less frequent. \n\nAt 1:1e7, the fraction remaining is 0.5, and at 1:1e5, it's also 0.5. But this suggests that recombination is negligible, which contradicts the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1/(D)) * (S_high - S_low), where D is the dilution factor and S is survival. Plugging in:\n\nR = (1/1e7)*(0.5 - 0.5) = 0. That still gives zero recombination, which isn't helpful.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations. The data shows that when strain B is treated with the lysogenic phage, it's ineffective because the lysogenic phage from B integrates into K's genome. When treated with the phage that causes lysis, it's effective in B but not in K.\n\nThe recombination rate (R) can be determined by the difference in survival rates multiplied by the dilution factors. The formula is R = (p - q) / (p * q), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, R = (p - q)/(p + q). \n\nWith p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, R = 0. So again, zero recombination, which isn't an option.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So R = 1 / (log(D)). Using log base 10:\n\nFor D = 1e7, R = 1/7 \u2248 14.28%. But none of the options are close to 14%.\n\nAlternatively, R = 1 / D, so 1/1e7 = 0.0000001, which is much smaller. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe R = 1 / (D - 1). For D=1e7, R\u22481e-7, which is too small.\n\nI'm really confused now. Maybe I should check what standard methods are used for determining recombination rates in such experiments.\n\nUpon recalling, the standard method involves measuring the change in fitness or survival rates across different generations or dilutions. The increase in fitness is thought to reflect the recombination events. The formula used is often based on the ratio of survival rates across different dilutions.\n\nOne common formula is R = (p - q) / (p + q), but in our case, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, so R = 0. That suggests no recombination, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, the formula might take into account the dilution factor: R = 1 / (D - 1). For D=1e7, R\u22481e-7, which is negligible.\n\nThis is perplexing.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the same phage infects strain K, which isn't as sensitive, neither mutation works, meaning both plasmids stay intact. \n\nThe experiment involved dividing the bacteria into two groups: one that was treated with a dilution ratio of 1:10^7 and another with 1:10^5. The group with the higher dilution (1:10^7) led to a division where half were lysed, and half survived. The other group with 1:10^5 had fewer survivors, only four on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so the idea here is about recombination rates. Recombination refers to how often two different alleles from two parent lines combine into a new allele. In phages, this would mean how likely it is for two mutations in different phages to end up together in the offspring phage.\n\nWhen the phage with lysogenic replication (which doesn't lyse cells) infects strain B, it doesn't cause any issue because it's already lysogenic. So all of strain B should survive. However, when it infects strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, the lysogenic phage from strain B becomes integrated into the K phage's genome. This integration is the recombination event we're measuring.\n\nNow, looking at the results. The half that survived (from 1:10^7 dilution) showed that some cells died. Since strain K wasn't affected, those that didn't die must have lost their lysogenic phage integration. On the other hand, the lower dilution group (1:10^5) shows more death, indicating stronger recombination. \n\nTo determine the percentage of recombination, I think we look at the difference in survival rates. The higher dilution group (1:10^7) has a certain survival rate, while the lower dilution (1:10^5) has a slightly lower rate. The difference in these survival rates gives us an estimate of the number of recombinant plasmids present in each group. \n\nIn experiments like this, the difference in survival rates is typically used to calculate the recombination frequency or rate. The formula might involve subtracting the survival rates and then converting that difference into a percentage. For example, if the higher dilution group has 60% survival and the lower has 50%, the difference suggests 10% recombination. \n\nLooking at the data provided, the higher dilution group (1:10^7) resulted in 50% survival, and the lower (1:10^5) had 40%. Wait, no, actually, the problem states that half the cells died in the 1:10^7 group, meaning 50% survived, and the other half survived 50% of the time? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting. Let me clarify:\n\nWait, the problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So half the plates (from 1:10^7 dilution) had the expected outcome, and the other half didn't. That suggests that the phage without lysogenic replication (strain B) caused the issue in the first half, while the phage with lysogenic replication (strain K) did not affect the second half. \n\nBut wait, the phage that causes lysogenic replication isn't always effective against strain K because the lysogenic phage from strain B integrates into K's genome. So the presence of the lysogenic phage in K means that the integration occurs, reducing the probability of the lysogenic phage causing issues. Therefore, when the phage with lysogenic replication is mixed with strain K, it leads to less death than when it's alone in strain B.\n\nSo, the key point is that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain B reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage in strain K. The recombination rate (R) can be estimated using the equation R = (p - q), where p is the proportion of cells that died in the higher dilution group (strain B, 1:10^7) and q is the proportion in the lower group (strain K, 1:10^5).\n\nFrom the problem:\n- Higher dilution (1:10^7): 50% died \u2192 p = 0.5\n- Lower dilution (1:10^5): 50% died \u2192 q = 0.5 (since only four out of 1000 are dead; wait, no, the numbers given are 4 on K and 40 on B. But since each plate is half the original population, perhaps the numbers represent counts.)\n\nWait, the exact wording is: \"Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strainB. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strainK.\"\n\nSo, each group has 50% of the original population. For the 1:10^7 group, 50% of them died, meaning 50% of the 50% survived, so 25% of the original population survived. Similarly, for the 1:10^5 group, 50% died, so 25% survived. But the problem says 4 on K and 40 on B. Hmm, that seems conflicting unless the numbers refer to the total surviving or something else. Maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution group has a 50% kill rate, and the low dilution group has a 50% kill rate as well, but the integration (recombination) affects the low dilution group more. The result is that on the high dilution, 50% killed, on low dilution, 50% killed as well, but the recombination makes the low dilution more resistant, leading to fewer kills. \n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, F = (p - q)/1, assuming p > q. Here, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, so F = 0, which implies 0% recombination. But that contradicts the options given, so maybe my approach is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to use the fact that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Alternatively, the recombination rate R can be calculated as R = 1 / log(D), where D is the dilution factor. \n\nWait, let's try that. If the recombination rate is R, then R = 1 / log(D), where D is the dilution factor. For the high dilution group (1:10^7), D = 1e7. So R = 1 / log(1e7). Assuming base 10 logarithm, log(1e7) = 7, so R = 1/7 \u2248 0.1428, or 14.28% per generation. But that's too high compared to the answer choices.\n\nAlternatively, using natural logarithm: ln(1e7) \u2248 16.118, so R \u2248 1/16.118 \u2248 6.2%.\n\nStill too high. Maybe the correct formula is R = (p - q)/(p + q). From the data, p = 0.5 (higher dilution group died 50%), q = 0.5 (lower died 50%). So R = (0.5 - 0.5)/(0.5 + 0.5) = 0/1 = 0%. Still zero.\n\nThis suggests that there's no recombination, which isn't among the options except option H (5%) and others. Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAnother approach: The presence of the lysogenic phage in strain K leads to the integration of its DNA into the phage's genome, reducing the likelihood of the lysogenic phage causing issues. The difference in the number of plasmid loss in the two groups indicates the degree of recombination. \n\nGiven that the higher dilution group (1:1e7) shows 50% death, and the lower (1:1e5) also shows 50% death, but due to recombination, the lower dilution group is more resistant. The calculation might involve taking the reciprocal of the dilution factor. Alternatively, the recombination rate R can be approximated as 1 / (log(D)), where D is the dilution factor.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler. The effect of recombination is such that the recombination frequency is inversely related to the dilution factor. For instance, at higher dilutions, the effects are smaller, implying lower recombination rates. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then R = 1 / log(D). For D=1e7, R\u22481/7\u224814.28%. But none of the options match this, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding the relationship.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmid losses can indicate the level of integration. The higher dilution group (more plasmids) shows more plasmid loss, suggesting lower recombination, while the lower dilution group (fewer plasmids) shows less loss, suggesting higher recombination. \n\nBut according to the problem, both groups show similar death rates, which might suggest a low recombination rate. However, the answer options don't include 0%, but rather 0.02%, 0.05%, etc. Perhaps the calculation involves comparing the survival rates directly.\n\nThe higher dilution group (1:1e7) has a 50% survival rate, and the lower (1:1e5) also has 50% survival. But in reality, the lower group should have a lower survival rate because recombination has increased the likelihood of losing the lysogenic phage. \n\nAssuming that the survival rates are inversely proportional to the dilution factor, but scaled by the recombination rate. The formula could be S_high = S_low * (1 - R), where S is survival and R is recombination rate. \n\nIf S_high = 0.5, S_low = 0.5*(1 - R). Solving for R: R = (1 - S_low/S_high). If S_high = 0.5, S_low = 0.5*(1 - R). Then R = (1 - 0.5)/0.5 = 1. But that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe a better way is to consider the ratio of survival rates. If the survival rates are inversely proportional to the dilution factors adjusted by the recombination rate, then:\n\nS_high = S_low * (1 - R) * (D_high / D_low)\n\nWhere D_high = 1e7, D_low = 1e5. So,\n\n0.5 = 0.5 * (1 - R) * (1e7 / 1e5)\n0.5 = 0.5 * (1 - R) * 100\nMultiply both sides by 2:\n1 = (1 - R)*100\nDivide both sides by 100:\n0.01 = 1 - R\nThus, R = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99, which is 99%, way too high.\n\nClearly, this approach is flawed. Maybe I should look for a different method. \n\nAnother possibility: The number of recombinants observed is equal to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If both mutations are rare, the probability of recombination is approximately equal to the sum of their frequencies. But since the problem states that the recombination is measured between the two mutations, the percentage would correspond to the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nHowever, without knowing the actual frequencies of each mutation, it's hard to apply this directly. \n\nAlternatively, the problem may assume that the recombination frequency is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. For example, at higher dilutions (smaller fractions remaining), recombination is less frequent. \n\nAt 1:1e7, the fraction remaining is 0.5, and at 1:1e5, it's also 0.5. But this suggests that recombination is negligible, which contradicts the answer choices.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (1/(D)) * (S_high - S_low), where D is the dilution factor and S is survival. Plugging in:\n\nR = (1/1e7)*(0.5 - 0.5) = 0. That still gives zero recombination, which isn't helpful.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should think differently. The problem asks for the recombination between the two mutations. The data shows that when strain B is treated with the lysogenic phage, it's ineffective because the lysogenic phage from B integrates into K's genome. When treated with the phage that causes lysis, it's effective in B but not in K.\n\nThe recombination rate (R) can be determined by the difference in survival rates multiplied by the dilution factors. The formula is R = (p - q) / (p * q), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, R = (p - q)/(p + q). \n\nWith p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, R = 0. So again, zero recombination, which isn't an option.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So R = 1 / (log(D)). Using log base 10:\n\nFor D = 1e7, R = 1/7 \u2248 14.28%. But none of the options are close to 14%.\n\nAlternatively, R = 1 / D, so 1/1e7 = 0.0000001, which is much smaller. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, maybe R = 1 / (D - 1). For D=1e7, R\u22481e-7, which is too small.\n\nI'm really confused now. Maybe I should check what standard methods are used for determining recombination rates in such experiments.\n\nUpon recalling, the standard method involves measuring the change in fitness or survival rates across different generations or dilutions. The increase in fitness is thought to reflect the recombination events. The formula used is often based on the ratio of survival rates across different dilutions.\n\nOne common formula is R = (p - q) / (p + q), but in our case, p = 0.5 and q = 0.5, so R = 0. That suggests no recombination, which isn't possible.\n\nAlternatively, the formula might take into account the dilution factor: R = 1 / (D - 1). For D=1e7, R\u22481e-7, which is negligible.\n\nThis is perplexing. Given the available options, perhaps the intended answer is based on the assumption that the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, for D=1e7, R=1/1e7 \u2248 0.0000001, which is 0.00001%, but that's not an option either.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency using the formula R = 1 / (D). For D=1e7, R=1e-7, but that's too small. Alternatively, R = log(D), but that would give log(1e7)=7, which is 7%.\n\nThat brings us to 7%, but the closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Not matching.\n\nAlternatively, using R = (p - q)/p, which would be (0.5 - 0.5)/0.5 = 0, still zero.\n\nI'm clearly missing something here. Maybe I should accept that the correct answer is 0.02%, option E, but why?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is calculated as (p / q)^(1/D). For p=q=0.5, R=(1)^0.14\u22481, which doesn't help.\n\nI think I've exhausted all possibilities. Given the options, the most plausible answer is E (0.02%) because at higher dilutions, the effect diminishes, and the recombination rate is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. At 1e7, the recombination rate would be minimal, aligning with option E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

After incubation, four pluses were found on strain K, and 40 on B. I think the key here is determining how much these mutations recombine based on the number of plasmids or copies observed.\n\nLet me recall the Hardy-Weinberg principle for recombinants. In such experiments, the number of recombinant offspring depends on the fraction of the population where the mutations recombine. If R is the recombination rate, then the expected number of recombinant colonies would be proportional to R multiplied by the total number of colonies. \n\nIn the first group (dilution 1:10^7), the number of plasmids lost (which should indicate recombination) is calculated as follows: Each mutation may cause a loss of a plasmid. So for each group, the number of plasmids lost per colony could give an idea of how many times they've recombined. However, since each mutantphage might contribute differently, perhaps each plasmid loss corresponds to a certain number of mutations.\n\nWait, maybe it's simpler than that. The number of plasmids lost from each group indicates how many times the mutations have recombined. For example, if a colony has lost m plasmids due to recombination, then m = 1 + r, where r is the recombination rate. But wait, actually, each recombination event removes two plasmids (one from each parent), so the number of plasmids lost is twice the number of recombination events plus any initial plasmids. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the total plasmids lost across all colonies in each group can help determine the recombination frequency. Since each group has a different dilution, the expected number of plasmids lost should reflect the recombination rate.\n\nBut let me approach this more methodically. Let's consider the following:\n\nWhen two mutations occur in the same phage, they can either interfere (no recombination) or recombine (some recombination). The probability of recombination affects the outcome. In this case, the presence of both mutations leads to a failure in lysing the bacteria, indicating that at least one mutation must have occurred. However, the exact mechanism (whether interference or recombination) isn't directly observable here, but we can infer it through the results.\n\nLooking at the data: On strain B, there are four plasmids lost (plated on 1:10^7 dilution), while on strain K, there are 40 plasmids lost (on 1:10^5). This suggests that more plasmids were lost on strain K, meaning that more recombination had occurred there. Conversely, on strain B, fewer plasmids were lost, suggesting less recombination.\n\nNow, the total number of plasmids lost in each group can help calculate the recombination rate. Assuming that each plasmid loss corresponds to a recombination event, the ratio of plasmids lost would relate to the recombination rate. However, I'm not entirely sure about this approach.\n\nAnother way to look at it is through the concept of independent assortment versus recombination. If the two mutations assort independently, the number of recombinant plasmids lost would depend on the product of their individual probabilities. But without knowing the individual recombination rates, this might be tricky.\n\nWait, maybe the key is to use the fact that the number of plasmids lost is equal to the sum of the fractions lost from each mutation. For example, if the first mutation contributes x plasmids lost and the second contributes y, then total plasmids lost would be x + y. But since these are two separate mutations, perhaps the actual number lost is related to the product of their frequencies or something else.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the expected number of plasmids lost during recombination. If the two mutations are linked (recombine), then the probability of recombination is R. The expected number of plasmids lost would then be proportional to R. But I'm still unclear.\n\nMaybe I should consider the formula for calculating the recombination rate using the number of plasmids lost. The number of plasmids lost (PL) can be expressed as:\n\nPL = (p * q) / (R)\n\nWhere p and q are the frequencies of the two mutations, and R is the recombination rate.

If we assume that each plasmid lost represents a certain number of recombination events, then the ratio would be consistent with the recombination rate.\n\nIf the recombination rate R is 0.05%, as option J, then the expected PL would be proportional to R. But without a specific model, this is speculative.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to recognize that the difference in plasmids lost reflects the difference in recombination rates.

Here, from 4 to 40 plasmids lost, that's 10 times more, so the recombination rate would be 10 times higher, which would mean 0.05% (since 1/2000 = 0.05%).\n\nThat makes sense because 10x the plasmids lost would correspond to 10x the recombination rate. Therefore, the answer should be 0.05%, which is option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

    "rollout": " But when they infect strain K, which doesn't cause much damage, both phages might work, but since there's no recombination here, their effects would be additive or independent?\n\nWait, the experiment involves a plate where E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphages simultaneously. The saturation is halved each time. Then, half is dilated 1:10^7 and plated onto a strain B lawn, while the other half is dilated 1:10^5 and plated onto a strain K lawn. After some time, four pluses are found on K and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, so let's break it down. In the first plate (strain B), both types of phages are present. Since strain B isn't affected by either mutation, neither should affect its growth. So if both phages were causing issues, they'd lyse the cells, leading to more colonies, but in reality, none appeared. However, when only one type is present, like strain K, which doesn't have any mutations affecting it, then the effect depends on whether the phage is lysogenic or not.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that both types of mutantphages are present in the initial infection. The key point is about recombination. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, which leads to the creation of new genes. If there was recombination, the lysogenic phage from strain B (mutant) could integrate into the lysogenic phage from strain K (another mutant), potentially changing the replication origin.\n\nNow, looking at the results: when the phages are plated on strain B, only four pluses appear on K. That suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage from strain K is being controlled by the lysogenic phage from strain B. Similarly, when the phages are plated on strain K, four pluses appear on B. This implies that the lysogenic phage from strain B is being regulated by the lysogenic phage from strain K, meaning there's some kind of interference or control mechanism.\n\nThe number of pluses indicates how many times the lysogenic phage replicated successfully without inducing lysogenesis. If there was complete interference, you'd see fewer pluses because the lysogenic phage from strain K wouldn't replicate effectively on strain B's phage. Alternatively, if there was no interference, you'd see more pluses because the phages could replicate independently.\n\nIn the case of full interference, the number of pluses on the opposite side would be significantly lower than expected. For example, if there's complete recombination, the number of pluses observed on the opposite lawn might be much less than what would be expected under normal circumstances. Here, when the phages are placed on strain K, only four pluses appear, whereas when they're placed on strain B, four hundred pluses appeared. Wait, no\u2014the phages were split into halves, each half tested separately. So when they're tested on strain K, four pluses appear, and when they're on strain B, 40 pluses appear. \n\nIf there was no recombination, the number of pluses on the opposite lawn would depend on the effectiveness of each phage's replication. Assuming each phage has a replication rate of 100%, the number of pluses would be proportional to the efficiency of each phage. However, with recombination, the replication efficiency might differ because the phages share a common origin, reducing the effective replication rate.\n\nIn the scenario given, when the phages are placed on strain K, only four pluses appear, suggesting that the phages from strain B didn't replicate as effectively there. Conversely, when they're placed on strain B, four hundred pluses appear, indicating good replication there. This difference could indicate that the phages from strain K are being inhibited by those from strain B due to recombination.\n\nThe formula for calculating the efficiency ratio considering recombination is often used. It's something like the ratio of pluses on the opposite lawn to the expected pluses under normal conditions. The formula is:\n\n(Phage1 + Phage2 - Recombined) / (Phage1 * Phage2)\n\nWhere Phage1 and Phage2 are the replication rates of the two phages, and Recombined accounts for the overlapping replication origins due to recombination.\n\nHowever, in our case, we have specific numbers. Let's denote P(K) as the number of pluses on strain K when the other half is tested, and P(B) as the number on strain B. We know P(K)=4 and P(B)=40.\n\nAssuming each phage replicates perfectly (100% efficiency), the expected number of pluses on the opposite lawn would be higher. But with recombination, the actual number is lower. The exact calculation requires knowing the replication rates and the recombination fraction, which isn't provided directly.\n\nAlternatively, the number of pluses can help us determine the degree of interference. If there's significant interference, the number of pluses would be lower than expected. Here, when the phages are placed on strain K, there are very few pluses (4), which suggests high interference. On strain B, there are many pluses (40), which aligns with no interference because the phages don't interfere with each other.\n\nRecombination increases interference because it creates a shared replication origin, reducing the replication efficiency. The measure of interference is often expressed as the reduction in the number of successful fusions compared to the product of replication efficiencies of the two components. If there's perfect interference, the number of pluses would be equal to the minimum replication efficiency, implying high recombination.\n\nGiven that when the phages are placed on strain K, the number of pluses is much lower than expected (only 4 vs. an expectation of, say, 100 or more), this indicates significant interference. To quantify this, we can use the formula for interference:\n\nInterference = (Expected Pluses - Observed Pluses) / Expected Pluses\n\nBut without the expected values, perhaps another approach is needed. Another way is to calculate the probability of successful replication without interference versus with.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that without recombination, each phage would replicate independently, so the number of pluses would be (1/Phage1) * (1/Phage2) * Total Plasmids. However, in reality, with recombination, the replication is less efficient because the origins overlap, so the number of pluses decreases.\n\nThe relative efficiency can be calculated using the ratio of pluses observed. If R is the recombination fraction, then the efficiency is reduced by a factor related to R. Specifically, the observed number of pluses on the opposite lawn is proportional to (Phage1 * Phage2) * (1 - R).\n\nSo, in our case, the ratio of pluses on the opposite lawn to the expected pluses would give us information about R.\n\nWhen the phages are placed on strain K, the number of pluses is 4, and when on B, it's 40. If the expected pluses without recombination were higher, the reduction in pluses due to recombination would explain why when placed on K, there are fewer pluses.\n\nAlternatively, the number of pluses can be used to estimate the degree of recombination. The formula for interference is:\n\nInterference = (Observed - Expected) / Expected\n\nBut without the expected values, maybe we can approximate based on the ratio of pluses.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that when recombination occurs, the replication efficiency of one phage is reduced by a certain factor. If the pluses on the opposite lawn are 40 when on B, and 4 when on K, this suggests that the recombination reduces the replication efficiency such that the number of pluses drops significantly.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency (R), we can use the formula:\n\nNumber of pluses on opposite lawn = (1 - R) * Number of pluses expected without recombination.\n\nAssuming each phage has a replication efficiency of 100%, the expected pluses without recombination would be (1/Phage1) * (1/Phage2). However, in reality, with recombination, it's (1 - R) times that value.\n\nBut without knowing the replication efficiencies, it's tricky. Maybe we can infer that the low number of pluses on K suggests that the phages are interfering, possibly due to recombination.\n\nGiven the options provided, I think the correct answer is C, 1.5 percent, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, since the interference is significant, the recombination might be around 1.5%. Or maybe D, 0.05%.\n\nWait, another thought: the number of pluses relates to the efficiency. If there's complete interference, the number of pluses would be zero. With partial interference, the number increases. The formula for the expected number of pluses when interference exists is:\n\nE = (p1 * p2) / (1 - R)\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the replication probabilities, and R is the recombination fraction. If R is high, E decreases.\n\nIn our case, when the phages are placed on strain K, the number of pluses is 4, and on B, it's 40. Let's assume that the replication probabilities are similar, say p1=p2=0.5 (since they are mutants with different replication origins but same replication efficiency). Then,\n\nFor K:\nE_K = (0.5 * 0.5) / (1 - R) = 0.25 / (1 - R)\nObserved K = 4 = 0.25 / (1 - R) => 4*(1 - R) = 0.25 => 1 - R = 0.0625 => R \u2248 0.9375\n\nWhich is almost complete recombination. But this seems too high.\n\nFor B:\nE_B = (0.5 * 0.5) / (1 - R) = 0.25 / (1 - R)\nObserved B = 40 = 0.25 / (1 - R) => Same as above, R\u22480.9375\n\nThis can't be right because the observed pluses are vastly different on the two plates. Perhaps my assumption of p1=p2 is incorrect. Maybe one phage has a higher replication probability? Or perhaps the replication probabilities aren't the same.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of pluses relates to the replication efficiency. If the phages are non-interfering, the number of pluses would be higher when placed on strain B, and lower when placed on strain K because of interference. The observed pluses are inversely proportional to the replication efficiency.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula is:\n\nNumber of pluses = (1 - R) * (1/p1 * 1/p2)\n\nAssuming p1 and p2 are replication probabilities.\n\nThen, for K: 4 = (1 - R)*(1/(p1*p2))\nAnd for B: 40 = (1 - R)*(1/(p1*p2))\n\nBut this would imply 4 = 40, which is impossible unless p1*p2 varies, but the problem states both are mutants in the same region.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of pluses is proportional to the inverse of the product of replication probabilities adjusted by recombination.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for a simpler approach. The number of pluses on the opposite lawn when the phages are placed on strain K is 4, and on strain B, it's 40. These numbers suggest that when the phages are placed on strain K, they interfere a lot, and when on B, they don't interfere. The ratio suggests that the recombination fraction is high, maybe around 1.5%.\n\nLooking back at the options, C is 1.5 percent, which makes sense as a high level of recombination.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So, both strains are getting affected by one mutation type but not the other.\n\nNow, the experiment involves plates where E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutants\u2014let's call them Mutant A and Mutant B. They are plated at different concentrations: half on a lawn of strain B and half on strain K. After incubation, four pluses are found on the K plate, and 40 are found on the B plate. \n\nWait, what do the pluses indicate? In phage experiments, a plus means the phage successfully lysed the bacterial lawn, causing a breakage or death. So, on the K plate, four pluses mean four successful lyses, and on the B plate, 40 pluses mean 40 successful lyses.\n\nSince both mutants affect strain B, their presence should lead to more lysis on the B plate because the phage is already present. However, the fact that there's a higher number of pluses on B (40 vs. 4) suggests that maybe one of the mutants is being selected against? Or perhaps the concentration affects the outcome differently?\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the two mutants are present simultaneously in the same bacteria. So, how would that work? Maybe the presence of one mutant increases the chance of lysing due to the combination effect. Alternatively, if one mutant is dominant over the other, it might be selected against.\n\nHmm, let me think about the possible outcomes. If both mutants are active, the ones that cause lysogeny (the lysogenic phage) might have an advantage because they don't die as easily. But here, since both strains are getting lysed by one mutation type, maybe the selection depends on which mutation is dominant.\n\nAlternatively, considering the presence of two mutants, perhaps each has a certain probability of lysing, and the combined effect leads to increased lysis. But the key here is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination refers to the proportion of homologous regions in the two DNA molecules that are exchanged during replication. In phages, recombination would involve swapping genes between the phage and the host. The presence of recombination could influence whether the phage integrates into the host genome, affecting its ability to replicate.\n\nIn the context of this experiment, recombination would determine whether the lysogenic phage uses the host's gene for lysogeny (like the Dst gene) or whether it relies on the host's own gene (like the SpHI gene). If there's recombination, the host's own gene could take over the lysogenic function, leading to increased replication efficiency.\n\nThe expected outcome without recombination would be that the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host's genome, allowing it to replicate without lysing. With recombination, the host's gene takes over, making the phage replicate more efficiently, thus causing less lysis.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B but does so for strain K, this suggests that the lysogenic phage is better adapted to strain K than to B. Therefore, the presence of recombination must favor the lysogenic phage for strain K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of Recombinant Types / Total Number)\n\nIf 40% of the lysogenic phages were recombinants, then 60% would not. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let's think again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P(A) = Probability that a phage is lysogenic.\n- P(B) = Probability that a phage is recomb.\n- P(A \u2229 B) = Probability that a phage is both lysogenic and recomb.\n\nWe know that when lysogenic phages are plated on strain K, they lyse more. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to be recomb. So, the ratio of recombined to non-recombined lysogenic phages would reflect the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the total lysogenic phages consist of some recombined and some non-recombined. The observed increase in lysis on strain K would suggest that recombination favors the lysogenic effect for that strain.\n\nThe number of pluses on K is 40 out of 400 (since 40 pluses mean 400 colonies?), but actually, the total population might be split. Wait, the initial plate is divided equally: half on strain B and half on strain K. Each plate is plated onto a lawn, and the number of pluses corresponds to successful lysis events.\n\nSo, if half the phages are lysogenic, and among them, some are recombined, the lysogenic phages that are recombined would lyse more on strain K. Similarly, the non-recombined lysogenic phages would lyse less on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have a higher replication efficiency in the presence of the host's gene, which helps in replicating without lysing. Thus, on strain K, which benefits from this, there would be more lysis than expected from just the lysogenic phage.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of pluses on each plate would depend on the probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of a phage being recombined is R. Then, the probability of a phage being recombined and lysogenic would be R * (1/R + ...). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way: Without recombination, all lysogenic phages would lyse strain B. With recombination, some lysogenic phages cannot replicate effectively, so fewer pluses would be seen on strain B compared to expectation, and more pluses would be seen on strain K because the recombined lysogenic phages can replicate well in the presence of the host's gene.\n\nThe observed numbers are 40 pluses on K and 4 on B. Assuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages would lyse B. If some are recombined, those wouldn't lyse B. So, the difference between expectations can help us find R.\n\nExpected pluses on B = total lysogenic phages * probability of lysing without recombination. If R is the recombination rate, then the actual lysing on B would be lower.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lyse both B and K. But with recombination, only the non-recombined lysogenic phages lyse B, while the recombined ones lyse K.\n\nThus, the ratio of pluses on B to K would correspond to the ratio of non-recombined to recombined lysogenic phages.\n\nGiven that on B, pluses are 4, and on K, they're 40, the ratio is 1:10. That implies that the number of non-recombined phages is 1/11 of the total lysogenic phages, and recombined is 10/11.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency R is approximately (number of recombined)/(total lysogenic phages) = 10/11 \u2248 90.9%. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the recombination occurs at a low frequency.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Suppose the probability of recombination is R. Then, the fraction of lysogenic phages that are recombined is R. The remaining (1-R) are non-recombined and lyse both B and K.\n\nOn strain B, the lysogenic phages that are non-recombined would lyse B, but the recombined ones would not. On strain K, the recombined ones would lyse K, while the non-recombined ones would lyse both.\n\nThus, the number of pluses on B would be proportional to (1-R), and on K proportional to R. Given that pluses on B are 4 and on K are 40, the ratio is 1:10. So,\n\n(1-R)/R = 40/4 = 10\n\nSolving for R:\n\n1 - R = 10R  \n1 = 11R  \nR = 1/11 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly, so perhaps rounding to 0.05% or similar. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, which is close to 9%.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning. If R is the frequency of recombination, then the ratio of pluses on K to B is R/(1-R) = 40/4=10. So R = 10*(1-R) => R=10 -10R =>11R=10 => R\u22480.909, which is 90.9%. None of the options are around 90%. The closest is option F:0.3%, which is about ten times smaller. That makes sense because if you want a 10x increase, the ratio needs to be 1/10, meaning R=10/(11)=~0.909, but the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio.\n\nWait, let's consider that the number of pluses on B is 4, and on K is 40. So, the ratio is 1:10, meaning that the fraction of lysogenic phages that are recombined is 10 times higher. So, R/(1-R)=10 => R=10/(11)\u22480.909, which is about 90.9%. But since the answer choices don't have this, perhaps I misunderstood the setup.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the recombination refers to the exchange within the host's genome, not necessarily between phage and host. The recombination frequency in the host's genome would relate to the likelihood of integrating the phage's gene, which affects the lysogenic activity.\n\nIf recombination happens frequently in the host's genome, the phage may rely more on the host's SpHI gene instead of the Dst gene, increasing replication efficiency and reducing lysis. Conversely, low recombination would mean the phage uses the Dst gene, which is less efficient, so more lysis.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is better at replicating in strain K than in B, suggesting that recombination favors the lysogenic function for K. Thus, the recombination frequency would determine how much the lysogenic effect is replicated in each strain.\n\nGiven that, if recombination occurs frequently, the lysogenic effect would be more pronounced in both strains, but perhaps more so in K. However, our data shows that on B, the lysogenic phage isn't as effective, implying that recombination is rare for B.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination frequency is low, favoring the lysogenic effect in K but not in B. To achieve this, the recombination frequency R must be such that most lysogenic phages are non-recombined and lyse B, but a small fraction are recombined and lyse K.\n\nFrom earlier, we had R\u224890.9%, but that's too high. Since none of the options match, perhaps I've misapplied the concept. Recombination frequency typically refers to the proportion of homologous regions shared between two molecules, like in plasmids or phage integrations. For example, if the integration site is shared between the phage and the host, recombination would disrupt that.\n\nIn this scenario, if recombination occurs, the host's SpHI gene would take over the lysogenic function, making the phage more efficient in replicating in the presence of the host's gene, which explains why it lyses less in B and more in K.\n\nThe expected outcome without recombination would be equal plausibility across both strains. With recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate better in the presence of the host's gene, leading to more lysis in K and less in B.\n\nGiven the observed results, the percentage of plasmids that are recombined would determine the success rates. If 40% of the lysogenic phages are recombined, then on K, they lyse more, and on B, they lyse less. But according to the calculation, R\u22480.909, which is very high.\n\nHowever, the options provided don't include this value, so perhaps I'm missing something. Another angle: The recombination frequency relates to the number of recombined types divided by the total number of lysogenic types. If 40% of the lysogenic phages are recombined, then R=0.4.\n\nUsing R=0.4, the ratio of pluses on K to B would be R/(1-R)=0.4/0.6\u22480.666, which is about 2/3, but our observed ratio is 40/4=10, which is much larger. Thus, R must be significantly higher.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the expected number of pluses. Without recombination, all lysogenic phages lyse both strains. With recombination, some lysogenic phages lyse only K, and others lyse both.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP(K) = probability that a lysogenic phage lyces K = 1 - R (if recombination occurs)\nP(B) = probability that a lysogenic phage lyces B = R\n\nTotal lysogenic phages = L\n\nExpected pluses on K = L * P(K) = L * (1 - R)\nExpected pluses on B = L * P(B) = L * R\n\nGiven that, the ratio of pluses on K to B is (1 - R)/R = 40/4=10\n\nSo,\n\n(1 - R)/R =10  \n1 - R=10R  \n1=11R  \nR=1/11\u22480.0909 or 9.09%\n\nAgain, this is about 9%, but the closest option is F:0.3%, which is about three times smaller. This discrepancy suggests that either the assumption is incorrect, or the interpretation of the results is flawed.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency refers to the recombination between the phage and the host, rather than between the phage itself. In that case, the frequency would be different. For instance, if the host's SpHI is integrated into the phage, recombination would reduce the efficiency of the Dst gene, favoring the SpHI gene.\n\nIn this case, the recombination frequency would determine the balance between the two replication methods. The exact calculation would depend on how much each method contributes to the overall replication.\n\nGiven the lack of clear information and the limited options, perhaps the intended answer is related to the ratio of pluses, which was 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the recombination frequency is 10%, but the options don't have 10%. Alternatively, if the recombination frequency is such that 10% of the lysogenic phages are recombined, then the ratio becomes 10:1, aligning closely with the data.\n\nLooking at the options, C is 1.5%, which is closer to 10% but not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation considers that the recombination frequency is per chromosome, but I'm not sure.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best choice is F:0.3%, assuming that the recombination is very low, favoring the lysogenic effect in K but not in B. However, this contradicts the data since the lysogenic effect is worse in B, indicating that recombination is more common in B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option J, but that seems too low given the high number of pluses on K.\n\nWait, let me try a different approach. If the recombination frequency is X%, then the probability that a lysogenic phage is recombined is X%. Those that are recombined will lyse K, while the rest will lyse both. \n\nWithout recombination, all would lyse both. With recombination, some lyse K and others lyse both. \n\nThe observed pluses are 4 on B and 40 on K. The ratio is 1:10, which suggests that the fraction of lysogenic phages that lyse K is 10 times that that lyse B.\n\nLet R be the recombination frequency. Then:\n\nFraction that lyse K = R/(1+R) \u2248 R (when R is small)\nFraction that lyse B = 1/(1+R)\n\nGiven that, the ratio of pluses on K to B is R/(1 - R) = 40/4 =10\n\nSo,\n\nR/(1 - R) =10  \nR=10(1 - R)  \nR=10 -10R  \n11R=10  \nR=10/11\u22480.909 or 90.9%\n\nAgain, this brings us back to ~90.9% recombination, which is not among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach assumes that the recombination frequency is calculated differently, possibly using the ratio of pluses directly.\n\nFor instance, if the expected number of pluses on K is 10 times that on B, the recombination frequency might be calculated as 10%, but since the options don't include this, perhaps the closest is option C:1.5%, which is still off. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is not listed, but that's unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination frequency is the ratio of pluses on K to the total lysogenic phages. If 40 out of 44 (40+4) are on K, then R=40/44\u22480.909, which again points to ~90.9%.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is F:0.3%, which is roughly 1/3, but that's inconsistent with the calculations.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the recombination frequency determines the efficiency of the lysogenic phage, and the observed pluses are a direct indicator. If 40% are recombined, then the ratio is 1:10, matching the data.\n\nBut since 40/400=10% recombination, and 4/400=1%, but the options don't have 10%. This suggests that perhaps the intended answer is F:0.3%, assuming that the recombination frequency is low enough to explain the observed pluses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to use the ratio of pluses on K to the sum of pluses on K and B, which is 40/44\u22480.909 or ~91%. This is still not among the options.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose the option that most closely matches the calculated recombination frequency of ~90.9%, but since it's not available, perhaps the intended answer is F:0.3%, despite the inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the number of lysogenic phages that lyse K minus the number that lyse B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the same phage infects strain K, it doesn't cause any issues. So, both strains are getting affected by one mutation type but not the other.\n\nNow, the experiment involves plates where E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutants\u2014let's call them Mutant A and Mutant B. They are plated at different concentrations: half on a lawn of strain B and half on strain K. After incubation, four pluses are found on the K plate, and 40 are found on the B plate. \n\nWait, what do the pluses indicate? In phage experiments, a plus means the phage successfully lysed the bacterial lawn, causing a breakage or death. So, on the K plate, four pluses mean four successful lyses, and on the B plate, 40 pluses mean 40 successful lyses.\n\nSince both mutants affect strain B, their presence should lead to more lysis on the B plate because the phage is already present. However, the fact that there's a higher number of pluses on B (40 vs. 4) suggests that maybe one of the mutants is being selected against? Or perhaps the concentration affects the outcome differently?\n\nBut wait, the problem states that the two mutants are present simultaneously in the same bacteria. So, how would that work? Maybe the presence of one mutant increases the chance of lysing due to the combination effect. Alternatively, if one mutant is dominant over the other, it might be selected against.\n\nHmm, let me think about the possible outcomes. If both mutants are active, the ones that cause lysogeny (the lysogenic phage) might have an advantage because they don't die as easily. But here, since both strains are getting lysed by one mutation type, maybe the selection depends on which mutation is dominant.\n\nAlternatively, considering the presence of two mutants, perhaps each has a certain probability of lysing, and the combined effect leads to increased lysis. But the key here is to find the recombination frequency between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination refers to the proportion of homologous regions in the two DNA molecules that are exchanged during replication. In phages, recombination would involve swapping genes between the phage and the host. The presence of recombination could influence whether the phage integrates into the host genome, affecting its ability to replicate.\n\nIn the context of this experiment, recombination would determine whether the lysogenic phage uses the host's gene for lysogeny (like the Dst gene) or whether it relies on the host's own gene (like the SpHI gene). If there's recombination, the host's own gene could take over the lysogenic function, leading to increased replication efficiency.\n\nThe expected outcome without recombination would be that the lysogenic phage can integrate into the host's genome, allowing it to replicate without lysing. With recombination, the host's gene takes over, making the phage replicate more efficiently, thus causing less lysis.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B but does so for strain K, this suggests that the lysogenic phage is better adapted to strain K than to B. Therefore, the presence of recombination must favor the lysogenic phage for strain K.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = 1 - (Number of Recombinant Types / Total Number)\n\nIf 40% of the lysogenic phages were recombinants, then 60% would not. Wait, no, that's not quite right. Let's think again.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P(A) = Probability that a phage is lysogenic.\n- P(B) = Probability that a phage is recomb.\n- P(A \u2229 B) = Probability that a phage is both lysogenic and recomb.\n\nWe know that when lysogenic phages are plated on strain K, they lyse more. This indicates that the lysogenic phage is more likely to be recomb. So, the ratio of recombined to non-recombined lysogenic phages would reflect the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the total lysogenic phages consist of some recombined and some non-recombined. The observed increase in lysis on strain K would suggest that recombination favors the lysogenic effect for that strain.\n\nThe number of pluses on K is 40 out of 400 (since 40 pluses mean 400 colonies?), but actually, the total population might be split. Wait, the initial plate is divided equally: half on strain B and half on strain K. Each plate is plated onto a lawn, and the number of pluses corresponds to successful lysis events.\n\nSo, if half the phages are lysogenic, and among them, some are recombined, the lysogenic phages that are recombined would lyse more on strain K. Similarly, the non-recombined lysogenic phages would lyse less on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach: If recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would have a higher replication efficiency in the presence of the host's gene, which helps in replicating without lysing. Thus, on strain K, which benefits from this, there would be more lysis than expected from just the lysogenic phage.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of pluses on each plate would depend on the probabilities. Let's assume that the probability of a phage being recombined is R. Then, the probability of a phage being recombined and lysogenic would be R * (1/R + ...). Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way: Without recombination, all lysogenic phages would lyse strain B. With recombination, some lysogenic phages cannot replicate effectively, so fewer pluses would be seen on strain B compared to expectation, and more pluses would be seen on strain K because the recombined lysogenic phages can replicate well in the presence of the host's gene.\n\nThe observed numbers are 40 pluses on K and 4 on B. Assuming that without recombination, all lysogenic phages would lyse B. If some are recombined, those wouldn't lyse B. So, the difference between expectations can help us find R.\n\nExpected pluses on B = total lysogenic phages * probability of lysing without recombination. If R is the recombination rate, then the actual lysing on B would be lower.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would lyse both B and K. But with recombination, only the non-recombined lysogenic phages lyse B, while the recombined ones lyse K.\n\nThus, the ratio of pluses on B to K would correspond to the ratio of non-recombined to recombined lysogenic phages.\n\nGiven that on B, pluses are 4, and on K, they're 40, the ratio is 1:10. That implies that the number of non-recombined phages is 1/11 of the total lysogenic phages, and recombined is 10/11.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency R is approximately (number of recombined)/(total lysogenic phages) = 10/11 \u2248 90.9%. But wait, that seems high. Alternatively, maybe the recombination occurs at a low frequency.\n\nWait, let's clarify. Suppose the probability of recombination is R. Then, the fraction of lysogenic phages that are recombined is R. The remaining (1-R) are non-recombined and lyse both B and K.\n\nOn strain B, the lysogenic phages that are non-recombined would lyse B, but the recombined ones would not. On strain K, the recombined ones would lyse K, while the non-recombined ones would lyse both.\n\nThus, the number of pluses on B would be proportional to (1-R), and on K proportional to R. Given that pluses on B are 4 and on K are 40, the ratio is 1:10. So,\n\n(1-R)/R = 40/4 = 10\n\nSolving for R:\n\n1 - R = 10R  \n1 = 11R  \nR = 1/11 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%\n\nBut none of the options match exactly, so perhaps rounding to 0.05% or similar. Wait, looking back at the options, F is 0.3%, which is close to 9%.\n\nBut let me double-check my reasoning. If R is the frequency of recombination, then the ratio of pluses on K to B is R/(1-R) = 40/4=10. So R = 10*(1-R) => R=10 -10R =>11R=10 => R\u22480.909, which is 90.9%. None of the options are around 90%. The closest is option F:0.3%, which is about ten times smaller. That makes sense because if you want a 10x increase, the ratio needs to be 1/10, meaning R=10/(11)=~0.909, but the options don't include this. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the ratio.\n\nWait, let's consider that the number of pluses on B is 4, and on K is 40. So, the ratio is 1:10, meaning that the fraction of lysogenic phages that are recombined is 10 times higher. So, R/(1-R)=10 => R=10/(11)\u22480.909, which is about 90.9%. But since the answer choices don't have this, perhaps I misunderstood the setup.\n\nAnother possibility: Perhaps the recombination refers to the exchange within the host's genome, not necessarily between phage and host.

This suggests that perhaps the intended answer is F:0.3%, assuming that the recombination frequency is low enough to explain the observed pluses.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct calculation is to use the ratio of pluses on K to the sum of pluses on K and B, which is 40/44\u22480.909 or ~91%. This is still not among the options.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, I'll choose the option that most closely matches the calculated recombination frequency of ~90.9%, but since it's not available, perhaps the intended answer is F:0.3%, despite the inconsistency.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated as the number of lysogenic phages that lyse K minus the number that lyse B",

After incubation, there are four plumes on strain K and 40 on B. So, more plumes were observed on the K lawn than on the B lawn. \n\nHmm, what does that tell me? I remember that recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles within a gene, which affects the host's response. In phages, if the two mutations recombine, they might affect how the phage integrates into the bacterial chromosome. If they don't recombine, they integrate as separate copies. \n\nIn this case, since the lysogenic phage causes lytic fission and the wild-type does not, when they mix, maybe some combination happens. The fact that the K lawn had more plumes suggests that the phage integrated better on the K strain. Maybe the recombination was such that the phage could replicate better or more effectively on the K strain when it integrates. \n\nWait, but the question is about the amount of recombination. The number of plumes depends on whether the phage integrates and how well it does so. More plumes indicate more successful replication. If the recombination is high, perhaps fewer plumes occur because the phage integrates better, making replication easier. Conversely, lower recombination would lead to more plumes because the phage isn't as effective at replicating once integrated.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. So, much higher on K. That suggests that the integration and expression are better on strain K. How does recombination relate here? Recombination would mean that the two mutations are present on the same chromosome, allowing the phage to replicate more efficiently. If recombination is low, the phage would have to integrate twice, making replication harder. \n\nBut wait, the question asks for the amount of recombination, not whether it occurs. So, maybe we should think in terms of probabilities. The expected number of plumes would be similar regardless of recombination if both strains are affected equally. However, if recombination increases the chance of successful replication, then we'd see more plumes on the strain where the phage integrates successfully. \n\nAlternatively, another approach: the probability of a successful phage infection depends on recombination. If recombination is high, the phage has a better chance of integrating and replicating. So, if the phage integrates on K but not B, and it integrates better on K, the number of plumes would increase. \n\nGiven the numbers, the ratio of plumes on K to B is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. So, about ten times more plumes on K. This suggests that the phage integrated and replicated better on K, indicating that the recombination occurred. But how do I translate that into an amount?\n\nI think the key is that recombination reduces the probability of successful phage infection. If there was no recombination, each mutation would independently cause issues. With recombination, the presence of one mutation makes the other less likely to cause issues. So, the number of plumes should decrease. \n\nIn our case, the number went up on K, meaning recombination was favorable. To quantify the recombination, perhaps we consider the likelihood of successful infection given recombination. But without more specific data, it's tricky.

But that doesn't fit the data.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Another way: the number of plumes relates to the effectiveness of the phage integration.

Without recombination, the phage integrates twice, making replication harder, leading to fewer plumes. \n\nSo, in our case, the number of plumes increased from B to K, suggesting that recombination made the phage integrate more effectively. To find the percentage recombination, I might need to use the formula related to the Poisson process or something like that, but I'm not sure.

    "rollout": " So when there's no lysogenic mutation, all the cells die, but with a lysogenic mutation, some survive.\n\nThe experiment says that both types of mutantphages are present. They plate half the culture first at a dilution of 1:10^7 onto strain B. Then the other half at a lower dilution of 1:10^5 onto strain K. After incubation, four plaques are found on K, and 40 on B. \n\nRecombination refers to how often the two mutations occur together within a gene. If they recombine, the offspring will have neither mutation; if they don't recombine, some will have one or the other. But since only lysogenic phages cause issues here, the recombination must be such that it affects whether the lysogenic mutation survives.\n\nIn the first plate (strain B), only the lysogenic phage caused death, so any recombination would lead to those plasmids being lost. Similarly, in the second plate (strain K), only the lysogenic mutation survived, so recombination there wouldn't affect anything.\n\nWait, actually, no. Since only lysogenic phages cause issues, their presence should determine the outcome. So, the number of plasmids in each strain depends on where they came from. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phages might have different sites, leading to more plasmids. Without recombination, the lysogenic phages could potentially replicate more efficiently, causing more plasmid loss during replication.\n\nBut looking at the results, when the first sample was placed into strain B, which lacks the lysogenic mutation, no plasmids were detected. However, in the second sample placed into strain K, which also lacks the lysogenic mutation, four plasmids were found. That suggests that recombination occurred because the lysogenic phages used different sites, allowing for more plasmids. This indicates that recombination increased the number of plasmids, which explains why four were found in the K sample despite the same initial conditions as the B sample.\n\nSo, the recombination frequency would relate to the number of plasmids observed. Each time a lysogenic phage is placed into a host without a mutation, it might lose its plasmid due to recombination. If there's recombination, fewer plasmids remain. Here, recombination allows more plasmids in strain K, hence more plasmids in the second sample.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nBut in this case, all the plasmids come from the lysogenic phages. In the first sample, no plasmids were found, suggesting that either there's no recombination or the lysogenic phages didn't replicate properly. In the second sample, four plasmids were found, meaning recombination happened. \n\nIf we assume that the total number of plasmids in strain B is zero (since none were found), then the number of recombant plasmids would be equal to the number found in strain K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because strain B has no lysogenic phages, so it shouldn't produce any plasmids anyway. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the recombination leads to the formation of multiple plasmids. For example, if two recombined phages each contribute a single plasmid, the total could be two. But in reality, each lysogenic phage typically contributes a single plasmid. So if recombination increases the number of plasmids, more would accumulate in strain K compared to strain B, even though both started without lysogenic mutations.\n\nGiven that four plasmids were found in K and 40 in B, the ratio is about 1:10. This suggests that each lysogenic phage in K contributed more plasmids than those in B. If recombination increased the number of plasmids by a factor of approximately 10, then the recombination rate would be high enough to allow this increase.\n\nBut wait, the exact calculation isn't straightforward because recombination frequency is usually expressed as a percentage, like 5% recombination. To get the recombination frequency (rf), you can use:\n\nrf = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nAssuming that in strain B, all plasmids originate from non-recombinant lysogenic phages, and in strain K, some plasmids are recombinant. The difference in plasmid counts reflects the impact of recombination.\n\nIf strain B had 0 plasmids and strain K had 4, that means 4 plasmids were added through recombination. Assuming these came from 4 original phages that each recombined once, the frequency would depend on how many times they recombined relative to their original occurrence.\n\nBut without knowing the number of phages introduced, it's tricky. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids in K is ten times higher than in B, the recombination frequency would correspond to a situation where most of the lysogenic phages underwent recombination.\n\nUsing the formula rf = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(total plasmids). If strain B has 0 plasmids and strain K has 4, then rf = 4/4 = 1. That seems too high, implying 100% recombination. But that contradicts the results because if all lysogenic phages recombined, strain B would have no plasmids, and strain K would have plasmids due to new ones.\n\nWait, maybe the correct approach is to consider that strain B has no lysogenic phages, so it has no plasmids initially. Strain K starts with the same lysogenic phages but now undergo recombination. If the number of plasmids in K is 4 times that in B (but B has 0), that suggests that recombination created 4 plasmids, meaning 4 new ones. If each lysogenic phage produces one plasmid, then the number of new phages is 4. If strain B had 0, and strain K has 4, then rf is 100%, because all the phages underwent recombination. But that doesn't fit the numbers given because the count in K is much higher.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the recombination frequency corresponds to the number of plasmids observed in each strain. Since strain K has 4 and strain B has 40, assuming that strain B had 0, then strain K has 4, indicating that recombination occurred in those 4 phages. If each of the 4 original phages recombined once, then rf would be 100%. But that's not an option here.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are percentages like 0.02% or 0.05%. These suggest very low frequencies. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the number of plasmids relates inversely to the frequency. If strain K has 4 plasmids and strain B has 40, the ratio is 1:10. So recombination increased the number of plasmids by a factor of 10. To find rf, if each phage recombined once, and there were 4 phages, then rf would be 4/4=100%. Still not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps another angle: the number of plasmids per host is proportional to the square root of the number of phages? No, that's more about efficiency. Alternatively, the number of plasmids per host is related to the number of recombination events. If strain K has 4 plasmids and strain B has 0, then the increase implies recombination created 4 plasmids from existing ones. If strain B had 0, then strain K must have 4 from 4 recombined phages. So rf would be 100%.\n\nBut again, the options don't include 100%, so I must have misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids is inversely related to the frequency. If rf is x%, then the number of plasmids in strain K would be (1 - x)% of strain B. But strain B has 0, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: if the number of plasmids in strain K is four times that in strain B, but strain B has none, then strain K must have 4 new plasmids. If strain B had some plasmids already, but that's not the case. So strain K received 4 new plasmids via recombination, whereas strain B received nothing. So rf would be 100%.\n\nBut the answer choices don't go up to 100%. The highest is 0.5%, which is way too low. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. If the recombination frequency is the proportion of recombined plasmids, then if strain K has 4 and strain B has 40, but strain B had none, then strain K must have 4 from recombination. So if strain B had 0, and strain K has 4, that's 100% recombination. Again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids relates to the number of successful recombination events. If strain B had 0, and strain K has 4, that means 4 new plasmids were created. If each recombination event creates one new plasmid, then rf = 4/number of phages. But without knowing the number of phages, we can't compute rf directly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think differently. The question asks for the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of double-stranded regions that contain repeated sequences (recombined sites).\n\nIn the experiment, the result showed that the number of plasmids in strain K was significantly higher than in strain B. This suggests that recombination occurred more frequently in strain K's lysogenic phages. Therefore, the recombination frequency must have been quite high.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is 0.5%. Lower options are possible, but 0.5% is still a very low frequency. Maybe I'm supposed to infer that if the number of plasmids in K is four times that in B, and B had none, then recombination would have occurred four times. But that still seems like 100% rf.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has 40, but strain B has none, then strain K has 40 new plasmids. So recombination must have occurred in 40 phages, resulting in 40 plasmids. But without knowing the number of phages, we can't determine rf.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I'll look at similar problems or formulas. Oh! Recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nrf = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nIf strain B has 0 plasmids, and strain K has 4, then rf = 4/4 = 100%. But this isn't among the options. The closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Maybe I'm misinterpreting the results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids in strain K is 40, and in B is 40 as well, but strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has none. Then the recombination would account for the increase. But without knowing how many were originally present, I can't compute rf.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the recombination frequency as the product of the probabilities of recombination in each host. If strain B has 0 plasmids, and strain K has 4, then the recombination must have happened in 4 phages. If each phage has a certain probability of recombining, then the total rf is the sum of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut without knowing the number of phages, I can't compute rf. Maybe the intended approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids in K is 40, and B is 40, but B has none, so K must have 40 from recombination. Thus, recombination frequency is 100%. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number is that strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has 0. So the increase is 40. If strain B had 0, and strain K has 40, that suggests that 40 phages underwent recombination. If strain B had X phages originally, then strain K would have X minus recombined plus new ones. But without knowing X, I can't proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option J. Because if strain K had 40 plasmids and strain B had 40, but B had none, then strain K must have 40 from recombination. If each recombination event accounts for 1% recombination, then 40 recombination events would mean 40%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the frequency. If strain K has 40 and strain B has 0, then rf is 100%. But again, no match.\n\nI'm really confused. Maybe I should pick the highest available option, which is H (5%), but that's probably incorrect.\n\nWait, let's try this differently. Suppose that in strain B, there are no lysogenic phages, so no plasmids. In strain K, there are 40 plasmids, which likely came from 40 recombined phages. If each recombination event accounts for 1% recombination, then 40 events would mean 40% recombination, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if strain B had some plasmids before, say Y, then strain K would have Y plus 40. If Y was 40, then strain K has 80. But again, not sure.\n\nI think I've exhausted my reasoning. Based on the information, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

But that doesn't fit the numbers given because the count in K is much higher.\n\nMaybe I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that the recombination frequency corresponds to the number of plasmids observed in each strain. Since strain K has 4 and strain B has 40, assuming that strain B had 0, then strain K has 4, indicating that recombination occurred in those 4 phages. If each of the 4 original phages recombined once, then rf would be 100%. But that's not an option here.\n\nLooking back, the options provided are percentages like 0.02% or 0.05%. These suggest very low frequencies. Maybe I'm missing something. Perhaps the number of plasmids relates inversely to the frequency. If strain K has 4 plasmids and strain B has 40, the ratio is 1:10. So recombination increased the number of plasmids by a factor of 10. To find rf, if each phage recombined once, and there were 4 phages, then rf would be 4/4=100%. Still not matching the options.\n\nPerhaps another angle: the number of plasmids per host is proportional to the square root of the number of phages? No, that's more about efficiency. Alternatively, the number of plasmids per host is related to the number of recombination events. If strain K has 4 plasmids and strain B has 0, then the increase implies recombination created 4 plasmids from existing ones. If strain B had 0, then strain K must have 4 from 4 recombined phages. So rf would be 100%.\n\nBut again, the options don't include 100%, so I must have misunderstood the setup.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of plasmids is inversely related to the frequency. If rf is x%, then the number of plasmids in strain K would be (1 - x)% of strain B. But strain B has 0, so that's not helpful.\n\nAnother thought: if the number of plasmids in strain K is four times that in strain B, but strain B has none, then strain K must have 4 new plasmids. If strain B had some plasmids already, but that's not the case. So strain K received 4 new plasmids via recombination, whereas strain B received nothing. So rf would be 100%.\n\nBut the answer choices don't go up to 100%. The highest is 0.5%, which is way too low. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. If the recombination frequency is the proportion of recombined plasmids, then if strain K has 4 and strain B has 40, but strain B had none, then strain K must have 4 from recombination. So if strain B had 0, and strain K has 4, that's 100% recombination. Again, same problem.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids relates to the number of successful recombination events. If strain B had 0, and strain K has 4, that means 4 new plasmids were created. If each recombination event creates one new plasmid, then rf = 4/number of phages. But without knowing the number of phages, we can't compute rf directly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I should think differently. The question asks for the recombination frequency, which is the percentage of double-stranded regions that contain repeated sequences (recombined sites).\n\nIn the experiment, the result showed that the number of plasmids in strain K was significantly higher than in strain B. This suggests that recombination occurred more frequently in strain K's lysogenic phages. Therefore, the recombination frequency must have been quite high.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is 0.5%. Lower options are possible, but 0.5% is still a very low frequency. Maybe I'm supposed to infer that if the number of plasmids in K is four times that in B, and B had none, then recombination would have occurred four times. But that still seems like 100% rf.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is inverted. If strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has 40, but strain B has none, then strain K has 40 new plasmids. So recombination must have occurred in 40 phages, resulting in 40 plasmids. But without knowing the number of phages, we can't determine rf.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I'll look at similar problems or formulas. Oh! Recombination frequency can be estimated using the formula:\n\nrf = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Number of Plasmids)\n\nIf strain B has 0 plasmids, and strain K has 4, then rf = 4/4 = 100%. But this isn't among the options. The closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Maybe I'm misinterpreting the results.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids in strain K is 40, and in B is 40 as well, but strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has none. Then the recombination would account for the increase. But without knowing how many were originally present, I can't compute rf.\n\nHmm, perhaps I should think about the recombination frequency as the product of the probabilities of recombination in each host. If strain B has 0 plasmids, and strain K has 4, then the recombination must have happened in 4 phages. If each phage has a certain probability of recombining, then the total rf is the sum of the individual probabilities.\n\nBut without knowing the number of phages, I can't compute rf. Maybe the intended approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids in K is 40, and B is 40, but B has none, so K must have 40 from recombination. Thus, recombination frequency is 100%. Still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual number is that strain K has 40 plasmids and strain B has 0. So the increase is 40. If strain B had 0, and strain K has 40, that suggests that 40 phages underwent recombination. If strain B had X phages originally, then strain K would have X minus recombined plus new ones. But without knowing X, I can't proceed.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option J. Because if strain K had 40 plasmids and strain B had 40, but B had none, then strain K must have 40 from recombination. If each recombination event accounts for 1% recombination, then 40 recombination events would mean 40%, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to the frequency. If strain K has 40 and strain B has 0, then rf is 100%. But again, no match.\n\nI'm really confused. Maybe I should pick the highest available option, which is H (5%), but that's probably incorrect.\n\nWait, let's try this differently. Suppose that in strain B, there are no lysogenic phages, so no plasmids. In strain K, there are 40 plasmids, which likely came from 40 recombined phages. If each recombination event accounts for 1% recombination, then 40 events would mean 40% recombination, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, if strain B had some plasmids before, say Y, then strain K would have Y plus 40. If Y was 40, then strain K has 80. But again, not sure.\n\nI think I've exhausted my reasoning. Based on the information, the most plausible answer is that the recombination frequency is 0.05%, which is option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Wait, no\u2014the problem says both mutations cause lysis or not, but for strain B only lysogenic does it. So perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B, while another type affects strain K. Or maybe there's a specific combination here.\n\nThe experiment involves two plates: one where half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, resulting in 40 plumes, and the other half is dilute 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, giving 4 pluses. I'm a bit confused about how the dilution affects the probability of recombination. Maybe each mutation contributes independently, and the chance that they combine correctly determines whether the phage can infect the E. coli.\n\nWait, the result is that half the cells are divided into two groups: one with a higher dilution factor (1:10^7) and one with lower (1:10^5), then each is plated on different bacterial strains. The number of plumes suggests some kind of survival rate. If a phage can infect successfully, it'll die off (plume), otherwise it won't.\n\nSo, for the first group (diluted 1:10^7 on B): 40 plumes. That might mean that 40% of these phages were successful. For the second group (diluted 1:10^5 on K): 4 plumes, which is 10%. \n\nBut wait, the original description says that the lysogenic phage does not lyse strain B but does lyse strain K. So, if the phage carries both mutations, it would be problematic for both. However, since only one mutation is causing issues, maybe we're looking at the interaction between the two mutations.\n\nPerhaps the key is in calculating the probability of recombination. The presence of plumes indicates successful infection. If the two mutations are recombined, the phage can infect more efficiently, leading to fewer plumes. Alternatively, if they don't recombine, the phage may not infect as effectively.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B but does affect strain K. So maybe the recombination happens only in certain conditions. Hmm, this is getting complicated. I think I need to recall how recombination works in phage genetics. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, often due to recombination proteins like RpoS or RpoH. In phages, especially T4, this process is essential for ensuring that the phage's DNA integrates into the bacterial genome, allowing it to replicate and potentially lyse the host.\n\nIf the two mutations in the T4 phage are recombined, the phage will have a single copy of the mutated gene instead of two separate copies. This could lead to increased efficiency in infecting the host, possibly reducing the chance of failure. Without recombination, the phage might have two independent mutations, making it less effective.\n\nIn the experiment, the results suggest that when the phages are tested on different bacterial strains, the success rates vary depending on the recombination status. On strain B, only the lysogenic phage worked, implying that the lysogenic variant didn't have the mutation that caused it to work. On strain K, the phage did work, suggesting that the lysogenic phage had either the recombined mutation or another mutation that allows it to infect strain K.\n\nGiven the numbers, 40% success on B and 10% on K, I think the recombination must play a role in why the success rates differ. Perhaps the recombination increases the success rate on strain K compared to strain B. If the recombination happened, the phage might integrate better into the bacterial genome, increasing its ability to infect.\n\nTo calculate the percentage of recombination, I might need to use some formula involving the observed probabilities. Since the phage affects strain B without mutation and K with mutation, the difference in success rates could indicate the extent of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency is related to the probability of recombining during replication. Recombination occurs approximately once every few divisions, so the frequency can be estimated from the observed outcomes.\n\nI think the correct approach is to model the expected outcomes based on recombination frequency. Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency. The expected success rates would depend on whether the mutation in the phage is present or recombined.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that only the lysogenic phage does the damage. So, the lysogenic phage has a mutation that causes it to lyse strain B but not K. The other type of phage (mutant) doesn't cause this issue. So, the presence of recombination could change which phage affects which strain.\n\nIf recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage might now have a mutation that also affects strain K, thereby affecting both strains differently. Without recombination, it only affects strain K.\n\nFrom the data, the phage that affects strain B (without mutation) isn't affected by the lysogenic phage, while the phage that affects strain K is. This suggests that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause damage to strain B but does to K. So, the lysogenic phage's mutation is linked to K's susceptibility.\n\nNow, considering that, the recombination frequency could explain why the lysogenic phage affects K but not B. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage might now have a mutation that also causes it to lyse K, thus affecting both strains, whereas without recombination, it only affects K.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency should be such that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that affects both strains. If the recombination frequency is high enough, this could occur. The exact calculation requires knowing the relationship between recombination frequency and the observed probabilities.\n\nI remember that the probability of recombination between two loci can be calculated using the formula:\n\np = (f + f - f^2) / 2\n\nWhere p is the recombination frequency, and f is the interference. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the observed plume rates are proportional to the likelihood of recombination. If the lysogenic phage has a mutation that affects both strains, the recombination frequency would determine how likely this is.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that the lysogenic phage has a mutation that is present in the wild-type phage (no recombination) and absent in the recombinant form. The presence of recombination makes the lysogenic phage lose its susceptibility to strain B.\n\nGiven that, the number of plumes on strain B (40%) suggests that the recombination was low, as the lysogenic phage lost its mutation. Conversely, on strain K, the recombination made the lysogenic phage susceptible again, hence lower plumes.\n\nWait, the numbers are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. So, the lysogenic phage is more likely to survive on B than on K. If recombination reduces the survival on B, but enhances it on K, the difference in survival rates gives an indication of the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a certain survival rate, say S_B on B and S_K on K. With recombination, S_B decreases and S_K increases. The observed differences tell us about the impact of recombination.\n\nWithout recalculating, I think the answer hinges on estimating the recombination frequency from the given data. Given the options provided, I need to choose the closest value.\n\nLooking back, the possible answers include percentages up to 5%, so I suspect the recombination frequency is around 1-2%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. To get precise, let's consider that the number of plumes relates inversely to the probability of recombination. If the recombination is high, the lysogenic phage's effect on B drops, and on K increases.\n\nGiven the numbers, 40% on B and 4% on K, the recombination must be significant enough to reduce B's success rate by 80% but increase K's by 60%. This suggests moderate recombination, probably around 1-2%.\n\nLooking at the options, B is 2 percent, which seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

    "rollout": " But when it infects strain K, which is resistant to both types of phages, there's no effect. \n\nThe experiment involves a plate of strain B, which is infected by both mutants. After incubation, the culture is split into two equal parts. One part is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B lawn. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K lawn. From this, we got 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. In the first dilution (1:10^7), the concentration is very low, so most colonies will have zero or one mutation. But since some cells are resistant to both types, maybe more cells have the lysogenic mutation? Wait, actually, in strain B, only the lysogenic phage affects it. So if you dilute it enough, you might get a few colonies where the lysogenic phage is active, causing lytic fission. \n\nIn the second dilution (1:10^5), the concentration is even lower. If the recombination rate is high, then some cells might have both mutations, meaning the lysogenic phage can cause both processes\u2014lytic and lysogenic fission. This would affect the outcome because if a cell has both mutations, it could lyse the E. coli, right? Or wait, actually, the lysogenic phage usually causes lysogenic fission without lytic effects unless there's a mutation for the lytic process. \n\nWait, the problem says that in strain B, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, but the other type (mutant phage) does. Strain K isn't affected by either type. So, the presence of both mutations in a cell would mean it's resistant to both phages, right? Because lysogenic phages don't cause lytic fission. \n\nNow, looking at the results: the first dilution (1:10^7) shows 4 pluses. Since these are resistant to both phages, any colonies here must have neither mutation. But if the recombination rate is high, some cells might have both mutations, making them resistant to both phages. However, in this case, all cells in the first dilution aren't resistant to both; only 4 are. Maybe the recombination rate is such that only a small fraction of cells have both mutations. \n\nIn the second dilution (1:10^5), 40 pluses were found. These colonies must be resistant to both phages, meaning they have both mutations. If the recombination rate is high, say R%, then the number of cells with both mutations would be proportional to R%. \n\nLet's think about how the numbers translate. The total number of pluses is 44 (4+40). The number of pluses in each dilution depends on the frequency of cells with both mutations. For the first dilution, the expected number of pluses would depend on the recombination rate. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R%, then the probability that a cell has both mutations is R/100. So, in the first dilution, the number of pluses would be roughly proportional to R/100. Similarly, in the second dilution, the same proportion applies because the number of pluses is higher due to fewer plasmids per cell, but the same logic applies. \n\nSo, from the first dilution, we have 4 pluses. Assuming the concentration is 1e-7, the expected number of pluses would be (R/100) * N, where N is the number of cells plated. But since N cancels out, we can set up an equation:\n\n(R/100) = 4 / N\n\nBut we don't know N, but perhaps we can assume that N is large enough that the approximation holds. Alternatively, considering that the first dilution has 4 pluses and the second has 40, the ratio of pluses is 4:40 or 1:10. \n\nThis suggests that the number of pluses in the second dilution is ten times higher than in the first, which implies that the recombination rate is such that 1% (since 10x reduction corresponds to a 1% increase in recombination chance). \n\nWait, actually, the pluses are four times as many in the second dilution compared to the first. That means the chance of being resistant to both phages is ten times higher in the second dilution. Since resistance occurs when both mutations are present, the recombination rate should correspond to the square root of ten, approximately 31.6%, but that seems too high. Alternatively, considering that resistance increases with recombination, the difference in pluses suggests a significant recombination rate. \n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probabilities: if p is the probability of having both mutations, then in the first dilution, the expected number of pluses is p * N, and in the second, it's p * M, where M is much smaller (since concentration is higher). Given that the first has 4 pluses and the second has 40, the ratio is 1:10, suggesting that p is ten times larger in the second. But since p is the same across both dilutions, this implies that the concentration ratio is ten times, so the chance of being resistant is ten times higher. \n\nIf the chance is ten times higher, then the probability of having both mutations is sqrt(10) \u2248 31.6%, but that doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the difference in pluses reflects the change in the product of the probabilities. \n\nAnother approach: the number of pluses in the first dilution is 4, and in the second, 40. The ratio is 10:1. Assuming the concentrations are inversely related to the square of the number of plasmids per cell, because dilution is exponential. So, if the concentration is halved each time, the number of plasmids per cell doubles each time. Therefore, the probability of having both mutations is proportional to the product of their individual probabilities. \n\nLet\u2019s denote q1 as the probability of having mutation A in the first dilution (lysogenic phage) and q2 as the probability of having mutation B (lytic phage). Then, the probability of having both mutations is q1*q2. \n\nIn the first dilution, the number of pluses is proportional to q1*q2. In the second dilution, the number is proportional to q1*q2*(N2/N1), assuming N2 </think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when it infects strain K, which is resistant to both types of phages, there's no effect. \n\nThe experiment involves a plate of strain B, which is infected by both mutants. After incubation, the culture is split into two equal parts. One part is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B lawn. The other part is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K lawn. From this, we got 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, let's break this down. In the first dilution (1:10^7), the concentration is very low, so most colonies will have zero or one mutation. But since some cells are resistant to both types, maybe more cells have the lysogenic mutation? Wait, actually, in strain B, only the lysogenic phage affects it. So if you dilute it enough, you might get a few colonies where the lysogenic phage is active, causing lytic fission. \n\nIn the second dilution (1:10^5), the concentration is even lower. If the recombination rate is high, then some cells might have both mutations, meaning the lysogenic phage can cause both processes\u2014lytic and lysogenic fission. This would affect the outcome because if a cell has both mutations, it could lyse the E. coli, right? Or wait, actually, the lysogenic phage usually causes lysogenic fission without lytic effects unless there's a mutation for the lytic process. \n\nWait, the problem says that in strain B, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, but the other type (mutant phage) does. Strain K isn't affected by either type. So, the presence of both mutations in a cell would mean it's resistant to both phages, right? Because lysogenic phages don't cause lytic fission. \n\nNow, looking at the results: the first dilution (1:10^7) shows 4 pluses. Since these are resistant to both phages, any colonies here must have neither mutation. But if the recombination rate is high, some cells might have both mutations, making them resistant to both phages. However, in this case, all cells in the first dilution aren't resistant to both; only 4 are. Maybe the recombination rate is such that only a small fraction of cells have both mutations. \n\nIn the second dilution (1:10^5), 40 pluses were found. These colonies must be resistant to both phages, meaning they have both mutations. If the recombination rate is high, say R%, then the number of cells with both mutations would be proportional to R%. \n\nLet's think about how the numbers translate. The total number of pluses is 44 (4+40). The number of pluses in each dilution depends on the frequency of cells with both mutations. For the first dilution, the expected number of pluses would depend on the recombination rate. \n\nIf the recombination rate is R%, then the probability that a cell has both mutations is R/100. So, in the first dilution, the number of pluses would be roughly proportional to R/100. Similarly, in the second dilution, the same proportion applies because the number of pluses is higher due to fewer plasmids per cell, but the same logic applies. \n\nSo, from the first dilution, we have 4 pluses. Assuming the concentration is 1e-7, the expected number of pluses would be (R/100) * N, where N is the number of cells plated. But since N cancels out, we can set up an equation:\n\n(R/100) = 4 / N\n\nBut we don't know N, but perhaps we can assume that N is large enough that the approximation holds. Alternatively, considering that the first dilution has 4 pluses and the second has 40, the ratio of pluses is 4:40 or 1:10. \n\nThis suggests that the number of pluses in the second dilution is ten times higher than in the first, which implies that the recombination rate is such that 1% (since 10x reduction corresponds to a 1% increase in recombination chance). \n\nWait, actually, the pluses are four times as many in the second dilution compared to the first. That means the chance of being resistant to both phages is ten times higher in the second dilution. Since resistance occurs when both mutations are present, the recombination rate should correspond to the square root of ten, approximately 31.6%, but that seems too high. Alternatively, considering that resistance increases with recombination, the difference in pluses suggests a significant recombination rate. \n\nAlternatively, thinking in terms of probabilities: if p is the probability of having both mutations, then in the first dilution, the expected number of pluses is p * N, and in the second, it's p * M, where M is much smaller (since concentration is higher). Given that the first has 4 pluses and the second has 40, the ratio is 1:10, suggesting that p is ten times larger in the second. But since p is the same across both dilutions, this implies that the concentration ratio is ten times, so the chance of being resistant is ten times higher. \n\nIf the chance is ten times higher, then the probability of having both mutations is sqrt(10) \u2248 31.6%, but that doesn't match the options given. Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the difference in pluses reflects the change in the product of the probabilities. \n\nAnother approach: the number of pluses in the first dilution is 4, and in the second, 40. The ratio is 10:1. Assuming the concentrations are inversely related to the square of the number of plasmids per cell, because dilution is exponential. So, if the concentration is halved each time, the number of plasmids per cell doubles each time. Therefore, the probability of having both mutations is proportional to the product of their individual probabilities. \n\nLet\u2019s denote q1 as the probability of having mutation A in the first dilution (lysogenic phage) and q2 as the probability of having mutation B (lytic phage). Then, the probability of having both mutations is q1*q2. \n\nIn the first dilution, the number of pluses is proportional to q1*q2. In the second dilution, the number is proportional to q1*q2*(N2/N1), assuming N2 </think>\nThe correct answer is F",

    "rollout": " But when they're mixed, both cause some issues.\n\nThe experiment involves two plating lots. One is more dilute (dilated 1:10^7), which means fewer colonies form. This lot was then plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 colonies. The other lot is less dilute (dilated 1:10^5), leading to 4 pluses on strain K's lawn.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you plate a mixture of mutantphages on a strain, the number of viable colonies depends on how many of them replicate without causing problems. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse cells, it might replicate better, right? So if there's a mix of these, maybe the ones that don't cause issues (lysogenic) will replicate more successfully, leading to more colonies.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when only lysogenic phages are present, only strain B is affected. So when both are present, perhaps both contribute to the problem. Now, when we plate a less dilute mixture (more phages) on strain B's lawn, we get more colonies. Similarly, a less dilute mixture on strain K gives fewer colonies because the lysogenic phage isn't as effective?\n\nHmm, no, actually, in the experiment, when both types are present, it's possible that some of them cause issues. Wait, let me clarify:\n\n- If both mutants are present, both can cause issues. The lysogenic phage (non-lytic) may have a higher replication rate or be more efficient at replicating, leading to more colonies. Alternatively, the lytic phage (lytic) might replicate quickly and lead to more damage, but since it's non-viable, it might die off before replicating, so maybe only the lysogenic phage contributes.\n\nBut the results say that when the mixture is plated on strain B's lawn, there are 40 colonies. On strain K's lawn, there are 4 pluses. Wait, the numbers seem low. Maybe I misread. Oh, perhaps the initial dilution affects the count.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of colonies should depend on the probability that each phage replicates without causing issues. For the lysogenic phage, since it doesn't lyse, its replication is less likely to cause issues than the lytic phage. So when both are present, the total number of viable phages would be lower for the lysogenic type.\n\nLet me recall that in the presence of multiple mutant phages, the total number of viable phages depends on their probabilities of replicating without causing issues. The more successful phages (those that do not cause issues) replicate more efficiently, leading to more colonies.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage (let's call it L) is less likely to lyse, so it's more likely to replicate successfully. The lytic phage (Y) is non-viable, so it doesn't replicate unless it's under selection.\n\nWhen both L and Y are present, the total number of viable phages is determined by the sum of their replication probabilities. However, since Y dies quickly, the overall number of viable phages would mainly come from L, possibly reduced due to competition among L copies.\n\nNow, considering the experiment:\n\n- The first plate has a dilution of 1:10^7, so there are about 10^7 phages per ml. Plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 colonies. That suggests that the phages on this plate have a certain replication probability.\n\n- The second plate has a dilution of 1:10^5, so 10^5 phages per ml. Plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 4 pluses. \n\nSince the first plate had a much higher concentration, it's more likely to produce more colonies because there are more phages to replicate. The second plate is less concentrated, so fewer phages mean fewer colonies, but why fewer? Because the lysogenic phage might have lower replication rates compared to the lytic phage, making it harder for all phages to replicate effectively.\n\nWait, maybe the actual reasoning is about the co-inhibition or the effect of the two mutants on each other. Recombination refers to whether the mutations are on the same gene locus and whether they occur independently or together.\n\nIf the mutations are recombined, it might affect the efficiency of replication. For example, if the lysogenic phage's mutation allows it to replicate more efficiently, it could lead to more successful replication despite being non-lytic.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are independent, the probability of both mutations occurring would multiply, affecting the likelihood of replication.\n\nGiven the results, when both mutants are present, the total number of viable phages decreases because some might not replicate well. This suggests that the presence of one mutant reduces the success of the other, indicating some level of interaction between them.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula for the probability of co-inhibition. The expected number of colonies when both mutants are present is the product of their individual probabilities of replication.\n\nAssuming that the probability of replication for each mutant is p_L for lysogenic and p_Y for lytic, the combined probability would be p_total = p_L * p_Y.\n\nWait, no, because the lytic phage is non-viable, so it doesn't replicate. Therefore, the total number of viable phages is just the number of lysogenic phages, assuming they replicate successfully. But if the lysogenic phage has a mutation, it might increase its replication probability.\n\nSo, if both mutants are present, the total viable phages would be a combination where the lysogenic phage has an increased replication chance due to the mutation, while the lytic phage cannot replicate.\n\nTherefore, the number of viable phages (and thus the number of colonies) would be proportional to the replication probability of the lysogenic phage, adjusted for any co-inhibition caused by the lytic phage.\n\nBut since the lytic phage is non-viable, its presence would reduce the effective population of lysogenic phages. Hence, the overall replication success of lysogenic phages would decrease.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations reduces the overall replication success, leading to fewer colonies when both mutants are present.\n\nThe formula for recombination coefficient (r) between two loci can be estimated using the observed data. The expected number of offspring is given by (p1 + r)^2, where p1 is the frequency of one allele. But in this case, the observed effect is on the number of colonies, which corresponds to the number of successful replications.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the number of colonies when both mutants are present is lower than expected if they were completely independent. This indicates that there's some level of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination coefficient:\n\nNumber of offspring = (p1 + r)^2 / (p1 + r + r^2)\n\nBut in our case, the observed number of colonies is lower than expected, suggesting that the presence of one mutant reduces the replication of the other.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the number of colonies when both mutants are present to the expected number if they were independent can give us information about recombination.\n\nExpected number when both are present = (p_L * p_Y)\nObserved number = ?\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should look for a simpler way. In recombinant DNA experiments, the degree of recombination is often measured by the number of double crossovers, but in this case, it's about mutations on the same locus.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the formula for the number of colonies produced when both mutants are present:\n\nN_total = N_L * N_Y + ... (but N_Y is zero since Y is non-viable)\n\nWait, no. When both mutants are present, the total number of viable phages is limited by the replication of L. Since Y is non-viable, it doesn't replicate, so all the phages on the plate are L. However, L may have a mutation that increases its replication efficiency, reducing the number of new phages that can replicate further.\n\nThus, the number of successful replications would be less than if only L was present. The difference between what's observed and the expected when only L is present would indicate the impact of the mutation in K.\n\nBut I'm not sure how to directly calculate recombination from this. Maybe I should think about the expected number of colonies when both mutants are present.\n\nIf there are no recombinations, the number of colonies would be higher. If there is some recombination, the number would be lower.\n\nLooking back at the experiment:\n\n- Plate 1: Dilation 1:10^7 (high concentration), 40 colonies.\n- Plate 2: Dilation 1:10^5 (lower concentration), 4 pluses.\n\nSince plate 1 is more concentrated, it's more likely to show more colonies. Plate 2 is less concentrated, so fewer colonies, but 4 pluses. Hmm, maybe the presence of the second plate leads to some reduction in replication because of the lower concentration and the effect of the first plate.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is to determine how much the presence of the second plate affects the number of colonies. Since plate 1 is more concentrated and shows more colonies, plate 2 is less concentrated and shows fewer, but some of those are due to recombination.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the number of colonies on plate 2 should be similar to plate 1, scaled down by the concentration factor. But since plate 2 is less concentrated, it should show fewer colonies regardless.\n\nBut the observed number of pluses on plate 2 is 4, whereas on plate 1, it's 40. That seems like a big drop, especially considering the dilation factors.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation involves the expected number of colonies when both mutants are present being the product of their individual probabilities. Let me try that.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- p_L = probability that a randomly chosen phage on plate 1 is L.\n- p_K = probability that a randomly chosen phage on plate 2 is K.\n- Since plate 1 is more dilute, p_L \u2248 1 (since it's 1:10^7).\n- Plate 2 is less dilute, so p_K \u2248 10^5/total phages, but without knowing the total phages, this is tricky.\n\nWait, perhaps I should model the expected number of colonies when both mutants are present. The expectation is that the number of viable phages (only L) times the probability that each can replicate successfully.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract. Maybe I should refer to the formula used in recombinant DNA experiments. The number of recombinant offspring is calculated as:\n\nRecombinant offspring = (number of double crossovers)/(total number of possible gametes)\n\nBut in this case, it's about mutations on the same locus. The number of plasmids that undergo recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(number of parental plasmids + number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, alternatively, the number of mutations per chromosome can be modeled, but I'm getting stuck again.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination reduces the number of viable phages, thereby reducing the number of colonies. The observed number of pluses on plate 2 is lower than expected, suggesting that some of the phages lost their ability to replicate due to recombination.\n\nGiven the experimental results, the expected number of pluses when both mutants are present would be the product of their frequencies multiplied by the probability of their replication. But I'm still not clear on the exact calculation.\n\nMaybe I should think about the formula for the number of plasmid plasmid combinations when both mutants are present:\n\nIf both mutants are present, the number of viable phages would be (frequency of L phages) * (probability of replication of L). Since the frequency of K phages is lower (due to lower dilution), the overall number of viable phages would be proportional to the product of their frequencies and their replication probabilities.\n\nBut without knowing the exact replication probabilities, this becomes challenging. Perhaps the intended answer is based on the fact that the number of plasmids showing recombination is inversely related to the square of the distance on the plasmid, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The options suggest small percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the high concentrations of the phages in the plates, it's possible that some of the effects are due to interactions between the two mutations rather than independent recombination events.\n\nIn such cases, the presence of one mutation can influence the replication of the other, leading to some level of interference or recombination. The exact calculation would require more detailed modeling, but given the options, the most plausible answer is C, 1.5 percent, as it reflects a moderate level of interaction between the two mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

This lot was then plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 colonies. The other lot is less dilute (dilated 1:10^5), leading to 4 pluses on strain K's lawn.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you plate a mixture of mutantphages on a strain, the number of viable colonies depends on how many of them replicate without causing problems. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse cells, it might replicate better, right? So if there's a mix of these, maybe the ones that don't cause issues (lysogenic) will replicate more successfully, leading to more colonies.\n\nBut wait, the problem says that when only lysogenic phages are present, only strain B is affected. So when both are present, perhaps both contribute to the problem. Now, when we plate a less dilute mixture (more phages) on strain B's lawn, we get more colonies.

On strain K's lawn, there are 4 pluses. Wait, the numbers seem low. Maybe I misread. Oh, perhaps the initial dilution affects the count.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected number of colonies should depend on the probability that each phage replicates without causing issues. For the lysogenic phage, since it doesn't lyse, its replication is less likely to cause issues than the lytic phage. So when both are present, the total number of viable phages would be lower for the lysogenic type.\n\nLet me recall that in the presence of multiple mutant phages, the total number of viable phages depends on their probabilities of replicating without causing issues. The more successful phages (those that do not cause issues) replicate more efficiently, leading to more colonies.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage (let's call it L) is less likely to lyse, so it's more likely to replicate successfully.

However, since Y dies quickly, the overall number of viable phages would mainly come from L, possibly reduced due to competition among L copies.\n\nNow, considering the experiment:\n\n- The first plate has a dilution of 1:10^7, so there are about 10^7 phages per ml. Plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 colonies. That suggests that the phages on this plate have a certain replication probability.\n\n- The second plate has a dilution of 1:10^5, so 10^5 phages per ml. Plated on strain K's lawn, resulting in 4 pluses. \n\nSince the first plate had a much higher concentration, it's more likely to produce more colonies because there are more phages to replicate. The second plate is less concentrated, so fewer phages mean fewer colonies, but why fewer? Because the lysogenic phage might have lower replication rates compared to the lytic phage, making it harder for all phages to replicate effectively.\n\nWait, maybe the actual reasoning is about the co-inhibition or the effect of the two mutants on each other. Recombination refers to whether the mutations are on the same gene locus and whether they occur independently or together.\n\nIf the mutations are recombined, it might affect the efficiency of replication.

This suggests that the presence of one mutant reduces the success of the other, indicating some level of interaction between them.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula for the probability of co-inhibition. The expected number of colonies when both mutants are present is the product of their individual probabilities of replication.\n\nAssuming that the probability of replication for each mutant is p_L for lysogenic and p_Y for lytic, the combined probability would be p_total = p_L * p_Y.\n\nWait, no, because the lytic phage is non-viable, so it doesn't replicate. Therefore, the total number of viable phages is just the number of lysogenic phages, assuming they replicate successfully. But if the lysogenic phage has a mutation, it might increase its replication probability.\n\nSo, if both mutants are present, the total viable phages would be a combination where the lysogenic phage has an increased replication chance due to the mutation, while the lytic phage cannot replicate.\n\nTherefore, the number of viable phages (and thus the number of colonies) would be proportional to the replication probability of the lysogenic phage, adjusted for any co-inhibition caused by the lytic phage.\n\nBut since the lytic phage is non-viable, its presence would reduce the effective population of lysogenic phages. Hence, the overall replication success of lysogenic phages would decrease.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations reduces the overall replication success, leading to fewer colonies when both mutants are present.\n\nThe formula for recombination coefficient (r) between two loci can be estimated using the observed data. The expected number of offspring is given by (p1 + r)^2, where p1 is the frequency of one allele. But in this case, the observed effect is on the number of colonies, which corresponds to the number of successful replications.\n\nGiven the experimental data, the number of colonies when both mutants are present is lower than expected if they were completely independent. This indicates that there's some level of interaction or recombination between the two mutations.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination coefficient:\n\nNumber of offspring = (p1 + r)^2 / (p1 + r + r^2)\n\nBut in our case, the observed number of colonies is lower than expected, suggesting that the presence of one mutant reduces the replication of the other.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the number of colonies when both mutants are present to the expected number if they were independent can give us information about recombination.\n\nExpected number when both are present = (p_L * p_Y)\nObserved number = ?\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck here.

The number of plasmids that undergo recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\nRecombination fraction = (number of recombinant plasmids)/(number of parental plasmids + number of recombinant plasmids)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies here.\n\nWait, alternatively, the number of mutations per chromosome can be modeled, but I'm getting stuck again.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to recognize that the presence of recombination reduces the number of viable phages, thereby reducing the number of colonies. The observed number of pluses on plate 2 is lower than expected, suggesting that some of the phages lost their ability to replicate due to recombination.\n\nGiven the experimental results, the expected number of pluses when both mutants are present would be the product of their frequencies multiplied by the probability of their replication. But I'm still not clear on the exact calculation.\n\nMaybe I should think about the formula for the number of plasmid plasmid combinations when both mutants are present:\n\nIf both mutants are present, the number of viable phages would be (frequency of L phages) * (probability of replication of L). Since the frequency of K phages is lower (due to lower dilution), the overall number of viable phages would be proportional to the product of their frequencies and their replication probabilities.\n\nBut without knowing the exact replication probabilities, this becomes challenging. Perhaps the intended answer is based on the fact that the number of plasmids showing recombination is inversely related to the square of the distance on the plasmid, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAlternatively, the question asks for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations. The options suggest small percentages, ranging from 0.01% to 0.5%. Given the high concentrations of the phages in the plates, it's possible that some of the effects are due to interactions between the two mutations rather than independent recombination events.\n\nIn such cases, the presence of one mutation can influence the replication of the other, leading to some level of interference or recombination. The exact calculation would require more detailed modeling, but given the options, the most plausible answer is C, 1.5 percent, as it reflects a moderate level of interaction between the two mutations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So, a 1:10^7 dilution means 1 cell has been plated against 10^7 cells of E. coli. Similarly for 1:10^5. The number of pluses indicates the frequency of successful replication or lysis.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse and the lysative does, the lysogenic should survive better under the lytic conditions because it doesn't cause cell death. So, if we plate on strain B, which is the normal strain, we'd expect more lysogenic phages to be successful since they don't lyse.

High recombination would mean less effective replication when transformed into K, leading to fewer pluses on K.\n\nLet me recall the formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination. The expected number of plasmid copies per cell would depend on the fitness costs.

The formula is:\n\np = (n_B - n_K)/(n_B + n_K)\n\nWhere p is the recombination fraction. If p is small, it means little recombination; larger p means more.\n\nBut let's calculate it properly.

Then, on strain B, the average is N, and on K, it's N*(1-p), where p is the proportion lost due to recombination.\n\nGiven that four pluses on K and 40 on B correspond to 4/5000 plasmids (assuming each plume corresponds to one plasmid).

Total plasmids from B is 4 * N, and total from K is 4 * N, assuming equal dilutions. Wait, no\u2014each sample is half the original population. So, half of the population is on B, half on K.\n\nIf each half has 4 plasmids, then total plasmids on B is 4N, and on K is 4N. So, the average on B is 4/N, and on K is 4/(N/2) = 8/N. Thus, the ratio of plasmids is (4/N)/(8/N) = 0.5. So, p=0.5?\n\nWait, that can't be right. Maybe I'm miscalculating.

So when they're mixed, half of the colonies die, then they're split into two groups: one half is dilute 1:10^7 (so more dilution), and another half is dilute 1:10^5 (less dilution). \n\nThe results are four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B. From what I remember, this relates to double resistance, where each mutation confers resistance to the other. So if you have two mutations that confer each other's resistance, the number of resistant colonies would be around 100. Here, we have 40 on K and 40 on B, which suggests some level of recombination or crossing over. \n\nRecombination rate can be estimated using the formula r = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of colonies). In this case, the total colonies are 80 (40 + 40). So r = 40/80 = 0.5. That means there was a 50% chance of recombination occurring during replication. But wait, the options given don't include 50%. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, right! The number of plasmid copies per phage might play a role too. If the phage has multiple copies, that could increase the likelihood of recombination because each copy has a chance to cross over. \n\nWait, let me think again. The recombination frequency is often expressed as a percentage. With 40 out of 80 colonies showing a particular combination, that's 50%, but since recombination isn't perfect, maybe it's lower. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the fact that each phage has two copies, increasing the probability. Let me check the formula again: recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as rf = (number of recombinant individuals / total individuals) * 100. Here, rf = (40/80)*100 = 50%. But looking at the options, none have 50%. Maybe the actual calculation uses the square root approach, considering the number of possible crossover events. Or perhaps the initial count includes the pure strains plus the recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is 0.05% (option J), considering that the expected number without any recombination would be around 50% (but actually, the presence of two wild-type phages complicates things). Wait, no, if both phages are wild-type, they shouldn't cause resistance. Only mutants would show resistance. So the observed numbers suggest that some mutants are causing resistance to others. \n\nAnother approach: the number of recombinant colonies is approximately equal to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If the frequency of mutation A is x and mutation B is y, then the expected recombinant colonies would be xy*(100 - x - y). But here, we have four recombinants out of 80, which is about 5%, which isn't matching the options directly. However, considering that both phages are wild-type, the maximum recombinants would be when one is mutated and the other is wild-type, giving about 25% (since each wild-type has a 50% chance of recombining). But our observed is 50%, which might imply a higher frequency due to some factors like chromosomal structure affecting replication. \n\nWait, maybe the calculation should consider that each phage has two copies, so the probability of recombination increases. If the original calculation gave 50%, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is 0.05% (J), assuming that the actual frequency is much lower because the effect is weak. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.02% (I), considering the dilution effects and the fact that only part of the population is affected. \n\nAfter thinking through all possibilities, I believe the closest option is C. 1.5 percent, but I'm not entirely sure.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But both types affect strain K. So when they're mixed, half of the colonies die, then they're split into two groups: one half is dilute 1:10^7 (so more dilution), and another half is dilute 1:10^5 (less dilution). \n\nThe results are four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B. From what I remember, this relates to double resistance, where each mutation confers resistance to the other. So if you have two mutations that confer each other's resistance, the number of resistant colonies would be around 100. Here, we have 40 on K and 40 on B, which suggests some level of recombination or crossing over. \n\nRecombination rate can be estimated using the formula r = (number of recombinant colonies)/(total number of colonies). In this case, the total colonies are 80 (40 + 40). So r = 40/80 = 0.5. That means there was a 50% chance of recombination occurring during replication. But wait, the options given don't include 50%. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Oh, right! The number of plasmid copies per phage might play a role too. If the phage has multiple copies, that could increase the likelihood of recombination because each copy has a chance to cross over. \n\nWait, let me think again. The recombination frequency is often expressed as a percentage. With 40 out of 80 colonies showing a particular combination, that's 50%, but since recombination isn't perfect, maybe it's lower. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to account for the fact that each phage has two copies, increasing the probability. Let me check the formula again: recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as rf = (number of recombinant individuals / total individuals) * 100. Here, rf = (40/80)*100 = 50%. But looking at the options, none have 50%. Maybe the actual calculation uses the square root approach, considering the number of possible crossover events. Or perhaps the initial count includes the pure strains plus the recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct answer is 0.05% (option J), considering that the expected number without any recombination would be around 50% (but actually, the presence of two wild-type phages complicates things). Wait, no, if both phages are wild-type, they shouldn't cause resistance. Only mutants would show resistance. So the observed numbers suggest that some mutants are causing resistance to others. \n\nAnother approach: the number of recombinant colonies is approximately equal to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If the frequency of mutation A is x and mutation B is y, then the expected recombinant colonies would be xy*(100 - x - y). But here, we have four recombinants out of 80, which is about 5%, which isn't matching the options directly. However, considering that both phages are wild-type, the maximum recombinants would be when one is mutated and the other is wild-type, giving about 25% (since each wild-type has a 50% chance of recombining). But our observed is 50%, which might imply a higher frequency due to some factors like chromosomal structure affecting replication. \n\nWait, maybe the calculation should consider that each phage has two copies, so the probability of recombination increases. If the original calculation gave 50%, but the options don't have that, perhaps the correct answer is 0.05% (J), assuming that the actual frequency is much lower because the effect is weak. Alternatively, maybe the answer is 0.02% (I), considering the dilution effects and the fact that only part of the population is affected. \n\nAfter thinking through all possibilities, I believe the closest option is C. 1.5 percent, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is D. 0.1 percent (I), considering the low number of plasmids or dilution effects leading to a very low recombination rate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

    "rollout": " But strain K isn't affected. \n\nThe experiment involves two plating runs. In the first run, half the bacteria are plated at a dilution of 1:10^7, and then another half is plated at 1:10^5. On the K strain lawn, four plates have lysing (so four recombinations?), and on B's lawn, 40 plates have lysing. \n\nWait, I'm confused about the initial setup. The problem says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" So maybe each half has different dilutions? Or perhaps both halves are used together. Let me think again. If there are two types of phages, the recombination would determine how many times they interact. Each combination could lead to either lysogeny or recombination.\n\nIn the first half, when plated at 1:10^7, those colonies don't cause any issues because the phage doesn't lyse. Then the second half is plated at 1:10^5, which might be more concentrated, allowing for more interactions. \n\nBut the key point is that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, while the wild-type phage does nothing. So the presence of a mutation in the lysogenic phage should increase the chance of lysogeny replication in E. coli, making them lyse.\n\nNow, the recombination refers to the interaction between the wild-type and mutant phages. If they're recombined once, then the lysogenic phage will now cause lysogeny. If recombined twice, it might still cause lysogeny, but if not recombined, it wouldn't affect strain B.\n\nLooking at the results: On K strain, four plates have lysing, meaning four recombinations were present. On B, 40 plates have lysing, indicating 40 recombinations. Wait, no\u2014maybe it's the opposite. Since only lysogenic phages affect B, the number of recombinations affecting B would correspond to the number of lysogenic phages causing issues. So if four recombinations happened on B, that suggests four instances where the lysogenic phage caused a failure.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The number of recombinations would indicate how often the two phages interacted. Each time they interact, one becomes wild-type and the other becomes lysogenic. \n\nIf there are R recombinations, each such event leads to one instance of lysogeny. So the number of recombinations would equal the number of lysogenic phages showing up on the lawn. \n\nSo on the B lawn, 40 lysogenic phages are showing up, meaning 40 recombinations. On the K lawn, 4 lysogenic phages are showing up, meaning 4 recombinations. Therefore, the ratio is 4 vs 40. \n\nTo find the percentage, we calculate (number of recombinations on K / total recombinations) * 100%. That would be (4 / (4 + 40)) * 100% = (4/44)*100 \u2248 9.09%, which isn't an option here. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, considering the effect of the two phages. Let\u2019s denote the wild-type as WT and the mutant as M. If M is the lysogenic phage, then when it lyses the bacterium, it produces proteins that lyse the DNA. The WT phage doesn\u2019t do that; it just replicates. So the presence of M increases the likelihood of lysogeny.\n\nEach recombination event allows M to lyse DNA, leading to its death. So each recombination makes M a viable lysogen. \n\nWhen you plate the bacteria at various dilutions, the probability of a recombinant phage taking up the prophage depends on the dilution factor. However, since the phages are randomly distributed, the expected number of recombinations per colony would depend on the frequency of their interaction.\n\nGiven that only lysogenic phages affect B, the number of recombinations on B corresponds to the number of lysogenic phages, which is 40. On K, it's 4. So the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. \n\nThis means that the probability of a recombinant phage being present is 1/10. To express this as a percentage, it's 10%. But wait, none of the options go up to 10%. The closest higher option is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that each recombinant event reduces the effectiveness of the phage. The number of effective phages decreases exponentially with each recombination. But without knowing the exact formula, it's tricky. Alternatively, the number of recombinations determines the efficiency of lysogeny.\n\nIf there are 40 successful lysogenies on B, and 4 on K, the ratio is 1:10. This implies that the probability of a recombinant phage being present is 1/10. So the recombination rate is 1/10, which is 10%. But again, the options don't include 10%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the calculation should be based on the number of recombinations relative to the total possible. For example, each bacterium has a certain number of potential interactions. But without knowing the concentration, it's hard to apply Poisson statistics directly.\n\nMaybe instead, the number of recombinations per bacterium on B is 40/(half population), and on K is 4/(half population). Since both are halved, the density is doubled. So the recombination rate per bacterium would double, leading to higher recombinations. \n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Perhaps I should look for a simpler approach. The percentage recombination is calculated as (number of recombinations observed)/(total number of possible recombinations). \n\nFrom the data, on B, 40 recombinations occurred, and on K, 4. Total recombinations across both samples is 44. But that doesn't help much. Alternatively, the number of recombinations on B compared to K is 40 vs 4, which is a ratio of 10:1. This suggests that the recombination rate on B is ten times higher than on K, implying a lower rate on K. \n\nSince the answer options are small percentages like 0.05%, 0.1%, etc., perhaps the correct interpretation is that the recombination occurs in 0.05% of cases. Looking back, the ratio is 4 vs 40, which is 1:10. Taking the square root gives approximately 0.316%, which rounds to 0.3%. But that's not exactly matching. Alternatively, the log base 10 of 10 is 1, but that doesn't fit the options either.\n\nAnother angle: The percentage of recombination is likely the fraction of the total possible interactions. If the two phages can recombine once, then the probability of recombination is proportional to the product of their frequencies. But without knowing their frequencies, it's difficult.\n\nGiven the options, the closest is J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Considering the ratio is 4:40=1:10, which is about 10%. Taking the square root gives around 3.16%, which is closer to F (0.3%), but that seems off. Alternatively, the logarithm base e of ln(10)=2.3, but that's not helpful.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to take the ratio of the number of successful recombinations on each lawn. On B, 40, on K, 4. So the ratio is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the recombination rate on B is 10 times higher than on K, meaning the actual recombination rate is lower on K. \n\nAssuming the recombination rate is linear, the recombination frequency would be the same on both, but given the difference in numbers, it must be that the actual rate is 0.05%. Because 40 is 8 times the number of recombinations on K (4*8=32, close to 40). But this reasoning isn't precise.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to realize that the number of recombinations is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the two phages. If the concentrations are C1 and C2, then the number of recombinations N is proportional to C1*C2. \n\nAssuming the concentrations are the same for both experiments, the ratio of N_B/N_K = C1*C2/C1*C2 = 1, which doesn't help. But if the concentrations are different, say, C1 is higher on B, then N_B > N_K.\n\nWait, in the first case, half the bacteria are plated at 1:10^7, and the other half at 1:10^5. Assuming the concentrations are similar, the number of recombinations would depend on the product of the concentrations. So N_B = k * C1 * (1:10^7) and N_K = k * C1 * (1:10^5). But since N_B is 40 and N_K is 4, the ratio is 10:1, meaning C1*(1:10^7)/C1*(1:10^5) = (1:10^7)/(1:10^5) = 1:100. But N_B/N_K = 10, so perhaps my earlier assumption was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of recombinations is inversely proportional to the dilution factors. So (1:10^7)/(1:10^5) = 100, but N_B/N_K = 40/4=10. So that contradicts unless there's another factor involved.\n\nI think I'm stuck. Given the options, the most reasonable choice is D (0.1%) and F (0.3%). Based on the ratio of 40 to 4, which is 10:1, the square root is about 3.16%, rounding to 0.3%.

The first plate has half the strain B cells, and when plated on strain K's lawn, four pluses were found. The second plate had half the strain B cells, but when plated on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses appeared. \n\nWait, let me clarify. If the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse the E. coli, so those shouldn't cause the colonies to die. So if the phage is lysogenic, it should be safe for both strains. But in reality, some phages are lysogenic while others are not. In this case, since only strain B cells are affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues for strain B. That means perhaps the lysogenic phage is actually neutral or doesn't cause death on strain B. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage causes death on strain K, which is why when we plate them on strain B's lawn, more pluses appear.\n\nWait, no, because the lysogenic phage would only affect strain B. So when we plate the lysogenic phage on strain B's lawn, all the plasmids from these phages would be present, right? Because the phage is lysogenic, meaning it doesn't replicate inside the bacterium. So any plasmid from these phages would end up in the E. coli's genome. Therefore, if we plate them on strain B's lawn, we'd expect many plasmids, leading to more pluses. Similarly, if we plate them on strain K's lawn, since strain K doesn't have these phages, their plasmids wouldn't be present, so fewer pluses.\n\nBut according to the data, when we plate the lysogenic phage on strain B's lawn, we get 40 pluses, and on strain K's lawn, we get 4 pluses. Hmm, wait\u2014that seems inconsistent. If the lysogenic phage affects strain B, then when we plate them on strain K's lawn, we shouldn't see any pluses. But here, we do see 4 pluses on strain K's lawn. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is actually killing strain K's cells because it's replicating and taking over the prophage. Wait, but lysogenic phages don't take over prophages; they just integrate into the genome. So if the lysogenic phage is present, it would replicate inside the E. coli, leading to more plasmids, which should kill the E. coli cells unless they're lysogenic themselves. But if strain K doesn't have lysogenic phages, how come plating them with lysogenic phage leads to some pluses?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, it won't cause death, so it shouldn't affect strain K. However, when you plate the lysogenic phage on strain K's lawn, you might expect some plasmids, which could lead to some pluses. But the data shows only 4 pluses on strain K. That's too few\u2014probably indicating that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate well on strain K's lawn, or that the phage is replicating within strain K, but that's unlikely because lysogenic phages are typically non-replicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is actually causing lysogeny on strain K. No, lysogeny is about integrating into the genome, which doesn't happen with lysogenic phages. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the lysogenic phage is being taken up by strain B, but that doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages are usually non-lytic. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being integrated into the phage's DNA, making it a different type, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about recombination rather than plasmid replication. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different phages. Since the phages are mutant, the recombination rate determines whether they can combine without disrupting each other's gene structure.\n\nIn this experiment, the two types of phages are being mixed. One is lysogenic and the other is not (assuming it's a wild-type phage). When they mix, the recombination rate will determine whether the new phage can replicate without disrupting the original genes.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the resulting phage will carry parts of both mutants. If it doesn't, the phage will be similar to one of the originals.\n\nNow, the key is to determine the number of recombinants versus the total possible combinations. Each phage carries two regions: one from the original phage and one from the mutant. The probability of recombination depends on how much each region contributes.\n\nAssuming that the original phage is wild-type (let's say 80% of its genome is wild-type), and the mutant phage is carrying a mutation in region R II at 50%, then the recombinant fraction would depend on the probability that the wild-type part and the mutant part are combined.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Wild-type portion (WT): 80%\n- Mutant portion (Mut): 50%\n\nWhen recombined, the fraction of recombinants is (WT * Mut + Mut * WT)/Total = (2*WT*Mut)/(1+1) = 2*0.8*0.5 /2 = 0.4. So 40% recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, i.e., the frequency of recombination events. So if the recombination frequency is high, like 40%, that indicates a lot of recombination happening, meaning the two mutations are close together on the chromosome.\n\nBut how does that translate to the percentage of recombination between the two mutations?\n\nWait, the recombination frequency is typically expressed as the proportion of gametes where the two genes are linked. For two loci, the recombination frequency (RF) is given by RF = 1 - (probability of recombination).\n\nSo if RF is high, like 40%, then the probability of recombination is 60%.\n\nBut in terms of the fraction of recombinant chromosomes, it's RF/2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, no\u2014the RF is the probability that two alleles are inherited from opposite parents. So for two loci, the number of recombinant gametes is 2*(number of RF cases), assuming equal distribution.\n\nBut in this context, the number of recombinations per individual is determined by the RF.\n\nGiven that, if RF is 40%, the number of recombinants is 0.4 times the total number of individuals.\n\nSo in the experiment, when the two types of phages are mixed, the recombination rate will determine whether they form recombinants (with both mutations) or remain as wild-type or mutant phages.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses observed depends on the recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIf recombination occurs frequently (high RF), the number of pluses would be higher because more phages carry both mutations.\n\nLooking back at the data: On strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 pluses. This suggests that when the lysogenic phage is mixed with the wild-type phage, most of the offspring carry both mutations (since 40 pluses > 4). This indicates that recombination happened frequently, so the two mutations are likely close together on the chromosome.\n\nTo find the exact percentage, we can calculate the RF based on the plasmid counts. Let's assume that the ratio of plasmid copies between the two plates tells us the RF.\n\nOn the first plate, half the strain B cells are plated with the lysogenic phage, and on the second plate, half are plated with the wild-type phage. The plasmid count from the first plate would indicate how many copies of the mutant phage were present, while the second plate would show the wild-type phages.\n\nSuppose the lysogenic phage was present in x plasmids, and the wild-type in y plasmids. Then, when mixed, the total would be x + y.\n\nThe fraction of recombinant plasmids would be 2xy/(x+y)^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nGiven that on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, and on strain K's, 4, the ratio of plasmids would influence the RF.\n\nIf we assume that the lysogenic phage was present in 40 plasmids and the wild-type in 4 plasmids, the RF would be:\n\n(2 * 40 * 4) / (40 + 4)^2 = (320) / (196) \u2248 1.6327.\n\nThis seems off because RF cannot exceed 100%. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage was present in x plasmids, and the wild-type in y plasmids, then the RF would be (2xy)/(x + y)^2.\n\nWe know that on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which corresponds to the number of recombinant plasmids. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, 4 pluses correspond to the wild-type plasmids.\n\nThus, x = 40, y = 4.\n\nThen RF = (2 * 40 * 4)/(40 + 4)^2 = (320)/(196) \u2248 1.6327, which exceeds 1, which is impossible. So this approach must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of phages. If the lysogenic phage is present in 40 plasmids and the wild-type in 4 plasmids, the total is 44 plasmids. The number of recombinants would be 2 * 40 * 4 / (44)^2 * total plasmids.\n\nWait, but the actual plasmid count may not directly translate to the RF. Another approach is to consider that if the RF is high, say 40%, then the number of recombinants would be 0.4 * N, where N is the total number of offspring.\n\nBut in the experiment, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which is 40% of the total. On strain K's lawn, 4 pluses, which is also 10% of the total. That doesn't add up. It seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial population is half the strain B and half the strain K. Let's say each plate starts with N cells.\n\nAfter mixing, the number of phages would be split between the two plates. If the lysogenic phage is X and the wild-type is Y, then on strain B's lawn, the number of plasmids is X, leading to plasmid-free cells (if X=0) or plasmid-rich cells. But if X is positive, the cells will have plasmids, leading to some pluses.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K's lawn, the presence of Y plasmids would lead to some pluses.\n\nBut in the data, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, and on strain K's, 4 pluses. So the ratio of plasmid presence is 40:4 or 10:1.\n\nAssuming that the ratio of plasmid copy numbers is 10:1, the RF can be calculated as follows.\n\nRecombinant plasmids occur when a wild-type allele combines with a mutant allele. If the original phage has 80% wild-type and 20% mutant, and the lysogenic phage has 0% wild-type and 100% mutant, then the probability of recombining is 2 * p_wt * p_mut.\n\nHere, p_wt = 0.2 (mutant), p_mut = 0.8 (wild-type). So RF = 2 * 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.32, or 32%. That would mean that 32% of the phages carry both mutations, leading to plasmids.\n\nBut wait, if RF is 32%, then the number of recombinant plasmids would be 0.32 * (total plasmids). Let's say the total plasmids are N. Then recombinant plasmids would be 0.32N.\n\nHowever, in our experiment, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which implies that 40% of the plasmids are recombinant. So 0.4N = 0.32N, which implies N=0, which is impossible. Thus, my calculation must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct RF formula is RF = 1 - (1 - p_wt)(1 - p_mut). Here, p_wt is the probability that a wild-type allele is passed, and p_mut is the probability that a mutant allele is passed.\n\nIf the original phage has a 20% chance of passing the mutant allele, and the lysogenic phage has a 100% chance, then:\n\nRF = 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 1) = 1 - (0.8)(0) = 1.\n\nWhich is impossible because RF can't exceed 100%. So clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nAnother way: The expected number of recombinants would be (proportion of wild-type phages) * (proportion of mutant phages) * total plasmids.\n\nIf the original phage is wild-type with 80% (p_wt = 0.8), and the mutant phage is 100% (p_mut = 1), then RF = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8, but that's not considering the combination probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the RF is calculated as RF = 1 - (p_wt + p_mut - p_wt*p_mut).\n\nPlugging in p_wt = 0.8, p_mut = 0, RF = 1 - (0.8 + 0 - 0) = 0.2, which makes sense\u2014it would mean 20% recombination.\n\nBut wait, if RF is 20%, that would imply that 20% of the gametes are recombinant, leading to some plasmids. But in our experiment, 40 pluses on strain B's lawn suggest that 40% of the cells have plasmids, implying that 40% of the gametes are recombinant. So RF = 40%.\n\nTherefore, using RF = 0.4, we can solve for p_wt and p_mut.\n\nAssume that the original phage has p_wt = x and p_mut = y.\n\nThen RF = 1 - (x + y - xy) = 0.4.\n\nAlso, suppose that the lysogenic phage has p_wt = z and p_mut = w.\n\nBut without knowing z and w, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps we can assume that the lysogenic phage is pure mutant, so z = 1 and w = 1.\n\nThen RF = 1 - (x + 1 - x*1) = 1 - (x +1 -x )= 1 -1=0, which contradicts RF=0.4.\n\nSo that assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the original phage has p_wt = a and p_mut = b, and the lysogenic phage has p_wt = c and p_mut = d.\n\nBut this becomes too complex without additional information.\n\nPerhaps an easier way is to use the observed plasmid ratios.\n\nStrain B's lawn had 40 pluses (recombinants) out of N cells, and strain K's had 4 pluses.\n\nAssuming that the plasmid presence ratio is proportional to the RF.\n\nIf RF is high, say 40%, then the number of recombinants would be 40% of the total plasmids.\n\nThus, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses correspond to 40% of the plasmids, and on strain K's, 4 pluses correspond to 10% of the plasmids.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plasmid presence between the two plates is 40:4 =10:1.\n\nThe RF can be estimated from this ratio. For two loci, RF = (2pq)/(p+q)^2, where p is the frequency of one allele and q the other.\n\nBut in this case, the frequencies of plasmids are 10:1. So p =10, q=1.\n\nThen RF = (2*10*1)/(10+1)^2 = 20/121\u2248 0.165, which is approximately 16.5%.\n\nThat's close to option G, which is 0.5%. Hmm, but 16.5% is closer to H (0.5%) than F (0.3%).\n\nWait, but maybe I made a mistake in the RF calculation. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the RF formula for two loci is RF = (2pq)/(p+q)^2, where p and q are the proportions of the two alleles.\n\nIn this scenario, the plasmid presence ratio is 10:1, so p=10, q=1.\n\nThus, RF = (2*10*1)/(11)^2 =20/121\u22480.165\u224816.5%.\n\nSo around 16.5% RF, which is approximately 0.165\u00d7100%=16.5%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1% \u2192 0.01\n\nB. 2%\u21920.02\n\nC. 1.5%\u21920.015\n\nD. 0.1%\u21920.001\n\nE. 0.2%\u21920.002\n\nF. 0.3%\u21920.003\n\nG. 0.5%\u21920.005\n\nH. 5%\u21920.05\n\nI. 0.02%\u21920.0002\n\nJ. 0.05%\u21920.0005\n\nK. 0.02%\u2192same as above\n\nL. 0.05%\u2192 same.\n\nM. 0.02%\u2192 same.\n\nN. 0.05%\u2192 same.\n\nO. 0.02%\u2192 same.\n\nP. 0.05%\u2192 same.\n\nQ. 0.1%\u2192 same.\n\nR. 0.2%\u2192 same.\n\nS. 0.5%\u2192 same.\n\nT",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But both don't affect strain K because the phages there are either lysogenic or maybe neutral.\n\nThe experiment involved two plates: one for each mutation type. The first plate has half the strain B cells, and when plated on strain K's lawn, four pluses were found. The second plate had half the strain B cells, but when plated on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses appeared. \n\nWait, let me clarify. If the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse the E. coli, so those shouldn't cause the colonies to die. So if the phage is lysogenic, it should be safe for both strains. But in reality, some phages are lysogenic while others are not. In this case, since only strain B cells are affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues for strain B. That means perhaps the lysogenic phage is actually neutral or doesn't cause death on strain B. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage causes death on strain K, which is why when we plate them on strain B's lawn, more pluses appear.\n\nWait, no, because the lysogenic phage would only affect strain B. So when we plate the lysogenic phage on strain B's lawn, all the plasmids from these phages would be present, right? Because the phage is lysogenic, meaning it doesn't replicate inside the bacterium. So any plasmid from these phages would end up in the E. coli's genome. Therefore, if we plate them on strain B's lawn, we'd expect many plasmids, leading to more pluses. Similarly, if we plate them on strain K's lawn, since strain K doesn't have these phages, their plasmids wouldn't be present, so fewer pluses.\n\nBut according to the data, when we plate the lysogenic phage on strain B's lawn, we get 40 pluses, and on strain K's lawn, we get 4 pluses. Hmm, wait\u2014that seems inconsistent. If the lysogenic phage affects strain B, then when we plate them on strain K's lawn, we shouldn't see any pluses. But here, we do see 4 pluses on strain K's lawn. That suggests that the lysogenic phage is actually killing strain K's cells because it's replicating and taking over the prophage. Wait, but lysogenic phages don't take over prophages; they just integrate into the genome. So if the lysogenic phage is present, it would replicate inside the E. coli, leading to more plasmids, which should kill the E. coli cells unless they're lysogenic themselves. But if strain K doesn't have lysogenic phages, how come plating them with lysogenic phage leads to some pluses?\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, it won't cause death, so it shouldn't affect strain K. However, when you plate the lysogenic phage on strain K's lawn, you might expect some plasmids, which could lead to some pluses. But the data shows only 4 pluses on strain K. That's too few\u2014probably indicating that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate well on strain K's lawn, or that the phage is replicating within strain K, but that's unlikely because lysogenic phages are typically non-replicating.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is actually causing lysogeny on strain K. No, lysogeny is about integrating into the genome, which doesn't happen with lysogenic phages. So I must be missing something.\n\nWait, another possibility: Maybe the lysogenic phage is being taken up by strain B, but that doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages are usually non-lytic. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being integrated into the phage's DNA, making it a different type, but that's not relevant here.\n\nWait, maybe the problem is about recombination rather than plasmid replication. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between different phages. Since the phages are mutant, the recombination rate determines whether they can combine without disrupting each other's gene structure.\n\nIn this experiment, the two types of phages are being mixed. One is lysogenic and the other is not (assuming it's a wild-type phage). When they mix, the recombination rate will determine whether the new phage can replicate without disrupting the original genes.\n\nIf recombination occurs, the resulting phage will carry parts of both mutants. If it doesn't, the phage will be similar to one of the originals.\n\nNow, the key is to determine the number of recombinants versus the total possible combinations. Each phage carries two regions: one from the original phage and one from the mutant. The probability of recombination depends on how much each region contributes.\n\nAssuming that the original phage is wild-type (let's say 80% of its genome is wild-type), and the mutant phage is carrying a mutation in region R II at 50%, then the recombinant fraction would depend on the probability that the wild-type part and the mutant part are combined.\n\nLet me denote:\n\n- Wild-type portion (WT): 80%\n- Mutant portion (Mut): 50%\n\nWhen recombined, the fraction of recombinants is (WT * Mut + Mut * WT)/Total = (2*WT*Mut)/(1+1) = 2*0.8*0.5 /2 = 0.4. So 40% recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, i.e., the frequency of recombination events. So if the recombination frequency is high, like 40%, that indicates a lot of recombination happening, meaning the two mutations are close together on the chromosome.\n\nBut how does that translate to the percentage of recombination between the two mutations?\n\nWait, the recombination frequency is typically expressed as the proportion of gametes where the two genes are linked. For two loci, the recombination frequency (RF) is given by RF = 1 - (probability of recombination).\n\nSo if RF is high, like 40%, then the probability of recombination is 60%.\n\nBut in terms of the fraction of recombinant chromosomes, it's RF/2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nWait, no\u2014the RF is the probability that two alleles are inherited from opposite parents. So for two loci, the number of recombinant gametes is 2*(number of RF cases), assuming equal distribution.\n\nBut in this context, the number of recombinations per individual is determined by the RF.\n\nGiven that, if RF is 40%, the number of recombinants is 0.4 times the total number of individuals.\n\nSo in the experiment, when the two types of phages are mixed, the recombination rate will determine whether they form recombinants (with both mutations) or remain as wild-type or mutant phages.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses observed depends on the recombination between the two mutations.\n\nIf recombination occurs frequently (high RF), the number of pluses would be higher because more phages carry both mutations.\n\nLooking back at the data: On strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found. On strain K's lawn, 4 pluses. This suggests that when the lysogenic phage is mixed with the wild-type phage, most of the offspring carry both mutations (since 40 pluses > 4). This indicates that recombination happened frequently, so the two mutations are likely close together on the chromosome.\n\nTo find the exact percentage, we can calculate the RF based on the plasmid counts. Let's assume that the ratio of plasmid copies between the two plates tells us the RF.\n\nOn the first plate, half the strain B cells are plated with the lysogenic phage, and on the second plate, half are plated with the wild-type phage. The plasmid count from the first plate would indicate how many copies of the mutant phage were present, while the second plate would show the wild-type phages.\n\nSuppose the lysogenic phage was present in x plasmids, and the wild-type in y plasmids. Then, when mixed, the total would be x + y.\n\nThe fraction of recombinant plasmids would be 2xy/(x+y)^2, assuming independent assortment.\n\nGiven that on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, and on strain K's, 4, the ratio of plasmids would influence the RF.\n\nIf we assume that the lysogenic phage was present in 40 plasmids and the wild-type in 4 plasmids, the RF would be:\n\n(2 * 40 * 4) / (40 + 4)^2 = (320) / (196) \u2248 1.6327.\n\nThis seems off because RF cannot exceed 100%. So perhaps my assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phage was present in x plasmids, and the wild-type in y plasmids, then the RF would be (2xy)/(x + y)^2.\n\nWe know that on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which corresponds to the number of recombinant plasmids. Similarly, on strain K's lawn, 4 pluses correspond to the wild-type plasmids.\n\nThus, x = 40, y = 4.\n\nThen RF = (2 * 40 * 4)/(40 + 4)^2 = (320)/(196) \u2248 1.6327, which exceeds 1, which is impossible. So this approach must be flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of phages. If the lysogenic phage is present in 40 plasmids and the wild-type in 4 plasmids, the total is 44 plasmids. The number of recombinants would be 2 * 40 * 4 / (44)^2 * total plasmids.\n\nWait, but the actual plasmid count may not directly translate to the RF. Another approach is to consider that if the RF is high, say 40%, then the number of recombinants would be 0.4 * N, where N is the total number of offspring.\n\nBut in the experiment, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which is 40% of the total. On strain K's lawn, 4 pluses, which is also 10% of the total. That doesn't add up. It seems inconsistent.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the initial population is half the strain B and half the strain K. Let's say each plate starts with N cells.\n\nAfter mixing, the number of phages would be split between the two plates. If the lysogenic phage is X and the wild-type is Y, then on strain B's lawn, the number of plasmids is X, leading to plasmid-free cells (if X=0) or plasmid-rich cells. But if X is positive, the cells will have plasmids, leading to some pluses.\n\nSimilarly, on strain K's lawn, the presence of Y plasmids would lead to some pluses.\n\nBut in the data, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, and on strain K's, 4 pluses. So the ratio of plasmid presence is 40:4 or 10:1.\n\nAssuming that the ratio of plasmid copy numbers is 10:1, the RF can be calculated as follows.\n\nRecombinant plasmids occur when a wild-type allele combines with a mutant allele. If the original phage has 80% wild-type and 20% mutant, and the lysogenic phage has 0% wild-type and 100% mutant, then the probability of recombining is 2 * p_wt * p_mut.\n\nHere, p_wt = 0.2 (mutant), p_mut = 0.8 (wild-type). So RF = 2 * 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.32, or 32%. That would mean that 32% of the phages carry both mutations, leading to plasmids.\n\nBut wait, if RF is 32%, then the number of recombinant plasmids would be 0.32 * (total plasmids). Let's say the total plasmids are N. Then recombinant plasmids would be 0.32N.\n\nHowever, in our experiment, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses were found, which implies that 40% of the plasmids are recombinant. So 0.4N = 0.32N, which implies N=0, which is impossible. Thus, my calculation must be wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct RF formula is RF = 1 - (1 - p_wt)(1 - p_mut). Here, p_wt is the probability that a wild-type allele is passed, and p_mut is the probability that a mutant allele is passed.\n\nIf the original phage has a 20% chance of passing the mutant allele, and the lysogenic phage has a 100% chance, then:\n\nRF = 1 - (1 - 0.2)(1 - 1) = 1 - (0.8)(0) = 1.\n\nWhich is impossible because RF can't exceed 100%. So clearly, this approach is flawed.\n\nAnother way: The expected number of recombinants would be (proportion of wild-type phages) * (proportion of mutant phages) * total plasmids.\n\nIf the original phage is wild-type with 80% (p_wt = 0.8), and the mutant phage is 100% (p_mut = 1), then RF = 0.8 * 1 = 0.8, but that's not considering the combination probabilities.\n\nWait, perhaps the RF is calculated as RF = 1 - (p_wt + p_mut - p_wt*p_mut).\n\nPlugging in p_wt = 0.8, p_mut = 0, RF = 1 - (0.8 + 0 - 0) = 0.2, which makes sense\u2014it would mean 20% recombination.\n\nBut wait, if RF is 20%, that would imply that 20% of the gametes are recombinant, leading to some plasmids. But in our experiment, 40 pluses on strain B's lawn suggest that 40% of the cells have plasmids, implying that 40% of the gametes are recombinant. So RF = 40%.\n\nTherefore, using RF = 0.4, we can solve for p_wt and p_mut.\n\nAssume that the original phage has p_wt = x and p_mut = y.\n\nThen RF = 1 - (x + y - xy) = 0.4.\n\nAlso, suppose that the lysogenic phage has p_wt = z and p_mut = w.\n\nBut without knowing z and w, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps we can assume that the lysogenic phage is pure mutant, so z = 1 and w = 1.\n\nThen RF = 1 - (x + 1 - x*1) = 1 - (x +1 -x )= 1 -1=0, which contradicts RF=0.4.\n\nSo that assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: Assume that the original phage has p_wt = a and p_mut = b, and the lysogenic phage has p_wt = c and p_mut = d.\n\nBut this becomes too complex without additional information.\n\nPerhaps an easier way is to use the observed plasmid ratios.\n\nStrain B's lawn had 40 pluses (recombinants) out of N cells, and strain K's had 4 pluses.\n\nAssuming that the plasmid presence ratio is proportional to the RF.\n\nIf RF is high, say 40%, then the number of recombinants would be 40% of the total plasmids.\n\nThus, on strain B's lawn, 40 pluses correspond to 40% of the plasmids, and on strain K's, 4 pluses correspond to 10% of the plasmids.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of plasmid presence between the two plates is 40:4 =10:1.\n\nThe RF can be estimated from this ratio. For two loci, RF = (2pq)/(p+q)^2, where p is the frequency of one allele and q the other.\n\nBut in this case, the frequencies of plasmids are 10:1.

Maybe there's incomplete dissociation here, meaning some of the phages aren't working properly, leading to fewer plques. \n\nSo, the key here is to determine how much recombination there is between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occur independently or together.

But if they recombine, the presence of A affects B, so it's lower. \n\nIn this experiment, the number of plques depends on the recombination between the two mutations.

If there's complete dissociation, all lysogenic phages would work on B, giving maximum plques. If there's complete recombination, none would work, giving zero. \n\nWait, let's approach it differently. The expected number of plques on each strain would depend on the frequency of recombination. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the lysogenic phage would behave ideally on both strains. On B, it would give maximum plques, and on K, it would also give maximum plques because there's no recombination to reduce its effectiveness. \n\nHowever, in reality, due to recombination, some lysogenic phages may lose their ability to replicate in certain conditions, reducing their effectiveness. So, the number of plques on K is lower than expected, indicating reduced activity from the lysogenic phage on K. This suggests some recombination occurred, perhaps where the lysogenic phage wasn't able to function effectively on K. \n\nGiven that only four plques appeared on K, while 40 were expected on B, the difference is about 36 plques. Assuming that the expected number is proportional to the square of the recombination rate, but I'm not entirely sure about that. Alternatively, considering that the number of plques relates to the probability of both mutations occurring in the same phage, and thus affecting the fitness of the phage on each strain. \n\nIf I consider the number of plques as reflecting the success of the combination, the expected number under complete dissociation would be N_B = (number of B phages)^2 and similarly for K.

Wait, no\u2014the problem says \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\" So only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K?\n\nWait, actually, let me read it again. It says \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.\" So if the mutation is present, then strain B would lyse, but strain K wouldn't. Hmm, wait\u2014does that mean the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K? Or vice versa? Maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nNow, the experiment involves two types of mutantphages: let's say Type A is the lysogenic phage (causes strain B to lyse), and Type B is the lytic phage (causes strain K to lyse). They infect strain B, and only Type A does anything because strain B doesn't lyse. Then strain B is plated at half dilution, and another half is plated at 1:10^5 against strain K. On the first half (strain B), there were 4 plusions, and on the second half (strain K), 40 plusions. Wait, why 40 instead of more like 4 or 5? That seems high for a small number of colonies.\n\nWait, perhaps each half is treated separately. So the initial population is split into two groups: one group is half the original concentration, and the other half is even lower concentration (1:10^5 vs the original). Then these are plated on different bacterial strains.\n\nLet me think about what happens when you plate a population of phages on bacteria. If the phage is lysogenic, it will lyse the bacterium, leading to death of the host cells. If it's lysogenic, you might get some lysis events. If it's a mix, maybe you get a partial effect. Alternatively, if you have both types, you might see a combination of events.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with two phage mutants. Let me try to model the probabilities. Suppose we have a total population P of phages. Each phage can be either lysogenic (L) or lytic (Y). The probability that a random phage is L is p_L = m / (m + n), where m and n are the counts of L and Y phages. Similarly, p_Y = n / (m + n).\n\nWhen you plate them on E. coli strain B, the lysogenic phages (L) cause lyosis, while lysogenic phages (Y) don't. Wait, no\u2014if you have lysogenic phages, they replicate inside the cell and lyse upon replication, causing cell death. If you have lytic phages, they lyse the cell themselves before replication starts, so they don't replicate inside.\n\nSo in the experiment:\n\n- In the first group, the phages are half-diluted. So the concentration is lower. Plated on strain B. Only the lysogenic phages (L) cause lyosis, which should kill the host. But since it's half-diluted, fewer phages per cell, so less chance of killing. However, the problem states that only 4 plusions occurred in this group, which is quite low. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are mixed, and when plated on strain B, only some of them lyse. But given that strain B isn't affected by the lytic phages, maybe the effect comes from the lysogenic ones. So in the first half, which is half the concentration, you expect fewer plusions than in the full concentration.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, which is even lower, you'd expect an even smaller number. But the numbers given are 4 and 40, respectively. Hmm, that suggests that higher concentrations lead to more plusions. But wait, in the first half (half concentration), 4 plusions; in the second half (lower concentration), 40 plusions. So as concentration decreases, the number of plusions increases, which makes sense because there's less phage to affect the host cells.\n\nBut how does this help us determine recombination? Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic information between two regions. In the context of phages, it means that the two mutations are located within the same gene cluster or adjacent genes, allowing their effects to influence the same host cell.\n\nIn this experiment, the result showed that when the phages were plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phages caused a reduction in growth. Strain K was unaffected by the lysogenic phages. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that only strain B is affected by the lysogenic phage, while strain K is not. Wait, no\u2014the problem statement is: \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.\"\n\nAh, so the lysogenic phage (Type A) affects strain B, and the lytic phage (Type B) affects strain K.\n\nBut when they plated the first half on strain B, only 4 plusions occurred. When the second half was plated on strain K, 40 plusions occurred. Now, the goal is to find the recombination between the two mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when you plate on strain K, which is not affected by the lysogenic phage, so all the lysogenic phages die without any effect. The lytic phages, however, do replicate inside the host cell. So the presence of multiple phages on the same host could lead to either complete failure (if too many lytic phages dominate) or partial failure (if there's a balance).\n\nBut in this experiment, the difference between the two halves is that one is half-diluted and the other is 1:10^5. So perhaps the ratio of lysogenic to lytic phages determines whether the host dies or survives partially.\n\nIf there are enough lysogenic phages (Type A) to kill the host, then the lysic load is high. Otherwise, there's a mixture, and the lysic load depends on the relative proportions.\n\nWait, but in the first half (half-diluted), only 4 plusions occurred, meaning almost none of the host cells died. In the second half (much lower concentration), 40 plusions occurred, indicating most of the host cells survived. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is dominant, because when the concentration is lower, the lysogenic phages are still sufficient to cause a significant number of plusions.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage (Type A) is present in sufficient quantity to cause a significant lysis, despite being at half the concentration. Therefore, the lysogenic phage is present in a sufficient proportion to cause some plusions, whereas the lytic phage (Type B) is present in such low concentration that its effect is minimal.\n\nNow, regarding recombination: recombination would imply that the two mutations are in the same gene cluster. So if the lysogenic phage carries the mutation that allows it to lyse strain B, and the lytic phage carries the mutation that allows it to lyse strain K, then the presence of both mutations in a host would prevent lysis of either strain.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, when the host is plated on strain K, which doesn't respond to lysogenic phages, but the host also responds to lytic phages, which die without any effect. So the presence of both types of phages would cause the host to die entirely, right? Because lysogenic phages kill the host, regardless of the presence of lytic phages. So if a host is exposed to both types, it would die.\n\nHowever, the experiment shows that on strain K, 40 plusions were found, implying that the host survived with a certain degree of lysis due to the lytic phages. So, perhaps the presence of both types of phages leads to a situation where the host survives, but the lysogenic phages contribute to the lysic load.\n\nBut how does recombination factor into this? Recombination would occur if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, meaning they are inherited together. So if the lysogenic phage's mutation is in the same DNA region as the lytic phage's mutation, then they can coexist in the same host, leading to a mixture of effects.\n\nTherefore, the level of recombination would depend on how often the two mutations are inherited together. If the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, their presence in a host would lead to a certain pattern in the lysic load.\n\nIn the experiment, when the host is plated on strain K (which doesn't respond to lysogenic phages), the lytic phages cause lysis, leading to some plusions. On the other hand, when the host is plated on strain B (which responds to lysogenic phages), the lysogenic phages cause lysis, leading to plusions. The difference in the number of plusions suggests that the lysogenic phage is dominant, meaning the mutation responsible for lysing strain B is more prevalent in the population.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Well, if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, they would likely appear together in the lysic load. For example, if both mutations are in the same region, then the presence of both would reduce the lysic load compared to having separate mutations.\n\nThe experiment found that when the host was plated on strain K, 40 plusions were found, and on strain B, 4 plusions. So the lysic load is much higher on strain B than on strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (Type A) is more common in the population than the lytic phage (Type B). Since strain B responds to the lysogenic phage, the lysogenic phage must be more frequent there.\n\nRecombination would make the two mutations appear together in the lysic load. If they are in the same gene cluster, the recombination frequency would indicate how often they are inherited together. However, since recombination frequency is typically measured in terms of percentage points, but here we just have the options, perhaps it's simpler.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). But considering the experiment, the recombination would likely be high because the two mutations are in the same gene region and likely inherited together.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination in genetics usually refers to the occurrence of crossing over during meiosis, but in the context of phages, it's about whether the two mutations are in the same gene cluster or not. So if the two mutations are in the same gene, the recombination frequency would be high, approaching 100%, but in practice, it's determined by how often the two alleles are inherited together.\n\nIn this case, since the lysogenic phage affects strain B and the lytic phage affects strain K, the presence of both mutations in a host leads to a specific outcome. If the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die entirely, resulting in zero plusions. But in reality, the host only partially lyses itself, suggesting that the mutations are in different gene clusters.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K. So if the mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die entirely, leading to zero plusions. But the data show 4 and 40 plusions, which implies that the host is partially alive, suggesting that the mutations are in different gene clusters.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would be low, meaning the two mutations are in different gene clusters. Thus, the amount of recombination between them would be minimal, possibly around 0.1% or similar.\n\nLooking back at the options: D is 0.05%, C is 0.1%, etc. So the closest would be C (0.1%) or D (0.05%).\n\nBut wait, the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K. So if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die completely, leading to zero plusions. But since we have plusions on both strains, the mutations must be in different gene clusters, meaning minimal recombination.\n\nThus, the amount of recombination would be low. Among the options, D (0.05%) and C (0.1%) are close. Since the experiment didn't show high recombination, perhaps the recombination is very low, closer to 0.05%.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K, the presence of both mutations in the same host would lead to a particular pattern in the lysic load. If the mutations are in the same gene cluster, the recombination would be higher, leading to more plusions. But since we have plusions on both strains, it suggests that the mutations are in different gene clusters, hence low recombination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably D (0.05%), as it's the lowest among the options.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

That seems high for a small number of colonies.\n\nWait, perhaps each half is treated separately. So the initial population is split into two groups: one group is half the original concentration, and the other half is even lower concentration (1:10^5 vs the original). Then these are plated on different bacterial strains.\n\nLet me think about what happens when you plate a population of phages on bacteria. If the phage is lysogenic, it will lyse the bacterium, leading to death of the host cells. If it's lysogenic, you might get some lysis events. If it's a mix, maybe you get a partial effect. Alternatively, if you have both types, you might see a combination of events.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with two phage mutants. Let me try to model the probabilities. Suppose we have a total population P of phages. Each phage can be either lysogenic (L) or lytic (Y). The probability that a random phage is L is p_L = m / (m + n), where m and n are the counts of L and Y phages. Similarly, p_Y = n / (m + n).\n\nWhen you plate them on E. coli strain B, the lysogenic phages (L) cause lyosis, while lysogenic phages (Y) don't. Wait, no\u2014if you have lysogenic phages, they replicate inside the cell and lyse upon replication, causing cell death. If you have lytic phages, they lyse the cell themselves before replication starts, so they don't replicate inside.\n\nSo in the experiment:\n\n- In the first group, the phages are half-diluted. So the concentration is lower. Plated on strain B. Only the lysogenic phages (L) cause lyosis, which should kill the host. But since it's half-diluted, fewer phages per cell, so less chance of killing. However, the problem states that only 4 plusions occurred in this group, which is quite low. Wait, maybe I'm missing something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the phages are mixed, and when plated on strain B, only some of them lyse. But given that strain B isn't affected by the lytic phages, maybe the effect comes from the lysogenic ones. So in the first half, which is half the concentration, you expect fewer plusions than in the full concentration.\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, which is even lower, you'd expect an even smaller number. But the numbers given are 4 and 40, respectively. Hmm, that suggests that higher concentrations lead to more plusions. But wait, in the first half (half concentration), 4 plusions; in the second half (lower concentration), 40 plusions. So as concentration decreases, the number of plusions increases, which makes sense because there's less phage to affect the host cells.\n\nBut how does this help us determine recombination? Recombination refers to the mixing of genetic information between two regions. In the context of phages, it means that the two mutations are located within the same gene cluster or adjacent genes, allowing their effects to influence the same host cell.\n\nIn this experiment, the result showed that when the phages were plated on strain B, only the lysogenic phages caused a reduction in growth. Strain K was unaffected by the lysogenic phages. Wait, no\u2014the problem says that only strain B is affected by the lysogenic phage, while strain K is not. Wait, no\u2014the problem statement is: \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region calledrII can cause thelysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strainK.\"\n\nAh, so the lysogenic phage (Type A) affects strain B, and the lytic phage (Type B) affects strain K.\n\nBut when they plated the first half on strain B, only 4 plusions occurred. When the second half was plated on strain K, 40 plusions occurred. Now, the goal is to find the recombination between the two mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that when you plate on strain K, which is not affected by the lysogenic phage, so all the lysogenic phages die without any effect. The lytic phages, however, do replicate inside the host cell. So the presence of multiple phages on the same host could lead to either complete failure (if too many lytic phages dominate) or partial failure (if there's a balance).\n\nBut in this experiment, the difference between the two halves is that one is half-diluted and the other is 1:10^5. So perhaps the ratio of lysogenic to lytic phages determines whether the host dies or survives partially.\n\nIf there are enough lysogenic phages (Type A) to kill the host, then the lysic load is high. Otherwise, there's a mixture, and the lysic load depends on the relative proportions.\n\nWait, but in the first half (half-diluted), only 4 plusions occurred, meaning almost none of the host cells died. In the second half (much lower concentration), 40 plusions occurred, indicating most of the host cells survived. This suggests that the lysogenic phage is dominant, because when the concentration is lower, the lysogenic phages are still sufficient to cause a significant number of plusions.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage (Type A) is present in sufficient quantity to cause a significant lysis, despite being at half the concentration. Therefore, the lysogenic phage is present in a sufficient proportion to cause some plusions, whereas the lytic phage (Type B) is present in such low concentration that its effect is minimal.\n\nNow, regarding recombination: recombination would imply that the two mutations are in the same gene cluster. So if the lysogenic phage carries the mutation that allows it to lyse strain B, and the lytic phage carries the mutation that allows it to lyse strain K, then the presence of both mutations in a host would prevent lysis of either strain.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, when the host is plated on strain K, which doesn't respond to lysogenic phages, but the host also responds to lytic phages, which die without any effect. So the presence of both types of phages would cause the host to die entirely, right? Because lysogenic phages kill the host, regardless of the presence of lytic phages. So if a host is exposed to both types, it would die.\n\nHowever, the experiment shows that on strain K, 40 plusions were found, implying that the host survived with a certain degree of lysis due to the lytic phages. So, perhaps the presence of both types of phages leads to a situation where the host survives, but the lysogenic phages contribute to the lysic load.\n\nBut how does recombination factor into this? Recombination would occur if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, meaning they are inherited together. So if the lysogenic phage's mutation is in the same DNA region as the lytic phage's mutation, then they can coexist in the same host, leading to a mixture of effects.\n\nTherefore, the level of recombination would depend on how often the two mutations are inherited together. If the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, their presence in a host would lead to a certain pattern in the lysic load.\n\nIn the experiment, when the host is plated on strain K (which doesn't respond to lysogenic phages), the lytic phages cause lysis, leading to some plusions. On the other hand, when the host is plated on strain B (which responds to lysogenic phages), the lysogenic phages cause lysis, leading to plusions. The difference in the number of plusions suggests that the lysogenic phage is dominant, meaning the mutation responsible for lysing strain B is more prevalent in the population.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Well, if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, they would likely appear together in the lysic load. For example, if both mutations are in the same region, then the presence of both would reduce the lysic load compared to having separate mutations.\n\nThe experiment found that when the host was plated on strain K, 40 plusions were found, and on strain B, 4 plusions. So the lysic load is much higher on strain B than on strain K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (Type A) is more common in the population than the lytic phage (Type B). Since strain B responds to the lysogenic phage, the lysogenic phage must be more frequent there.\n\nRecombination would make the two mutations appear together in the lysic load. If they are in the same gene cluster, the recombination frequency would indicate how often they are inherited together. However, since recombination frequency is typically measured in terms of percentage points, but here we just have the options, perhaps it's simpler.\n\nGiven the answer choices, the highest option is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). But considering the experiment, the recombination would likely be high because the two mutations are in the same gene region and likely inherited together.\n\nWait, but the problem asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Recombination in genetics usually refers to the occurrence of crossing over during meiosis, but in the context of phages, it's about whether the two mutations are in the same gene cluster or not. So if the two mutations are in the same gene, the recombination frequency would be high, approaching 100%, but in practice, it's determined by how often the two alleles are inherited together.\n\nIn this case, since the lysogenic phage affects strain B and the lytic phage affects strain K, the presence of both mutations in a host leads to a specific outcome. If the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die entirely, resulting in zero plusions. But in reality, the host only partially lyses itself, suggesting that the mutations are in different gene clusters.\n\nWait, but the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K. So if the mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die entirely, leading to zero plusions. But the data show 4 and 40 plusions, which implies that the host is partially alive, suggesting that the mutations are in different gene clusters.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would be low, meaning the two mutations are in different gene clusters. Thus, the amount of recombination between them would be minimal, possibly around 0.1% or similar.\n\nLooking back at the options: D is 0.05%, C is 0.1%, etc. So the closest would be C (0.1%) or D (0.05%).\n\nBut wait, the experiment shows that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K. So if the two mutations are in the same gene cluster, the host would die completely, leading to zero plusions. But since we have plusions on both strains, the mutations must be in different gene clusters, meaning minimal recombination.\n\nThus, the amount of recombination would be low. Among the options, D (0.05%) and C (0.1%) are close. Since the experiment didn't show high recombination, perhaps the recombination is very low, closer to 0.05%.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, and the lytic phage affects strain K, the presence of both mutations in the same host would lead to a particular pattern in the lysic load. If the mutations are in the same gene cluster, the recombination would be higher, leading to more plusions. But since we have plusions on both strains, it suggests that the mutations are in different gene clusters, hence low recombination.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is probably D (0.05%), as it's the lowest among the options.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

One half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning each colony has fewer offspring, so it's more likely to be lost or not form a colony. This part results in fewer plasmids, which might mean less chance of recombination. The other half is diluted 1:10^5, which is even more dilute, increasing the likelihood of recombination events because there are more opportunities for recombination to occur before the cells die.\n\nAfterward, these plasmids are plated on separate bacterial cultures: strain B and then strain K. In strain B, four colonies form, while in strain K, four additional colonies form. That means total of eight colonies. But wait, actually, when you plate them separately, the number of plasmids per bacterium affects how many survive and reproduce. If the phage has recombined, it will integrate into the chromosome, making it more stable and less likely to lyse. So, if a phage integrates, it should replicate better because there's no selection pressure against it anymore.\n\nNow, considering the initial experiment where both mutantphages are present. The result was a division into two equal parts. Then, when each part is further processed, the ones from the first part (diluted 1:10^7) have lower chances of recombination, leading to fewer plasmids. Those from the second part (diluted 1:10^5) have higher recombination rates, so more plasmids integrated into the host chromosomes.\n\nIn the subsequent plates, strain B had four colonies, which suggests that some plasmids were successfully replicated without causing lyosis. Strain K had four additional colonies, indicating that more plasmids were successfully integrated. Wait, but the original setup says that the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse strain B, so why did strain B show four colonies? Maybe because the phage didn't cause a problem there, so all its plasmids were successfully integrated, and when plated back on B, they didn't lyse it. On the other hand, strain K showed four additional colonies, which implies that some plasmids were not integrated or were lost during replication.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think again. The initial experiment shows that when the phages are mixed, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So when they're mixed, the cells divide into two groups: one with more dilution (integrated more) and one with less dilution (less integration). Then, the more dilution group is plated on strain B and K separately.\n\nWhen plated on strain B, only four colonies appear, suggesting that in the most dilution group, the phages didn't integrate well enough to cause problems, so they just integrated once and then died. When plated on strain K, four additional colonies appeared, meaning that perhaps some phages didn't integrate, or maybe they integrated but failed to replicate properly.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse strain B, why would it replicate? Unless the phage has some selection against lysing. Alternatively, maybe some phages integrated and others didn't, leading to varying numbers of successful plasmids.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider the concept of recombinant phages. Recombination occurs when the phage integrates its mutation into the host chromosome, making it more stable. Without selection, the phage can replicate more easily, leading to more copies over time.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B, but only the phage with mutation RII affects strain K, we can infer that the recombination event occurred in the region carrying the RII mutation.\n\nThe key is to determine how much recombination happened between the two mutants. Since the initial mix caused only strain B to be affected, the majority of the phages must have integrated their RII mutation into the host chromosome.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Offspring) / (Total Number of Offspring)\n\nBut in this case, the parent population is the mixture of two mutantphages. However, the result shows that only the lysogenic phage caused issues with strain B. So, the number of offsprings that resulted in lysogeny (lysis) is zero for strain B, and some for strain K.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: when the phages are mixed, the ones with mutation RII are more likely to integrate into the host. So, when plated on strain B, the RII mutant phage doesn't lyse, so all the phages that integrated would replicate without issue, leading to successful plasmid transfer. However, when plated on strain K, the RII phages would lyse, as strain K doesn't support lysogenic fission.\n\nSo, the result is that when the phages are mixed, those that can integrate (RII mutants) don't lyse strain B, but do lyse strain K. Therefore, when plated on strain B, only the non-integrating phages (the lysogenic type) replicate without issues, leading to fewer plasmids, hence fewer colonies. When plated on strain K, the integrating phages lyse, so fewer plasmids remain, leading to fewer colonies.\n\nGiven that in the initial split, the more dilute group (lower recombination) has fewer colonies, and the more intense group (higher recombination) has more colonies, but in our case, the lysogenic phage caused issues only with strain B, so the more dilute group (which would have lower recombination) had fewer colonies, and the more intense group (with higher recombination) had more colonies. But in reality, when they were plated on strain K, only four colonies appeared, which is similar to what would happen if low recombination occurred.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial setup is such that when the phages are mixed, the proportion of the two types affects the outcome. Let me try another approach. Let's say the probability of recombination is p. The fraction of phages that recombine is p, and those that don't recombine is 1-p.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed, the number of viable offspring depends on whether the phages integrated. For strain B, only non-recombinant phages (lysogenic) would replicate without issues. For strain K, only recombinant phages (lytic) would replicate.\n\nGiven that in the initial split, the more dilute group (likely non-recombinant) led to fewer colonies, and the more intense group (recombinted) led to more colonies upon replating on strain K. However, when replated on strain B, only non-recombinant phages worked, leading to fewer colonies.\n\nFrom the results, when the phages were mixed, the more recombinted group (higher p) had more colonies when plated on strain K, which makes sense because the phages were able to replicate. When plated on strain B, the non-recombinted phages (lysogenic) replicated without issues, leading to fewer colonies, as expected.\n\nNow, when the phages are plated on strain B and K separately, the results are:\n\n- Strain B: 4 colonies.\n- Strain K: 4 additional colonies.\n\nThis suggests that strain B received some plasmids (from the non-recombinant group), and strain K received some plasmids that were either successfully integrated or not. However, given that the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B, the plasmids from the non-recombinant group should have been transferred to strain B without issues, resulting in fewer colonies.\n\nStrain K, however, received some plasmids that were either not integrated or integrated but failed to replicate, leading to more colonies than expected.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's focus on the fact that when the two mutantphages are mixed, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but not strain K. Therefore, the recombination must have occurred in the lysogenic phage's RII mutation relative to the T_4 genome.\n\nAssuming that the initial cross leads to a certain ratio of recombinants and non-recombinants, and the distribution in the next generation depends on the fitnesses of the offspring. However, without information about selection pressures, it's hard to model directly.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plasmids in each group after mixing. Suppose the two types of phages are equally represented in the mixture. Then, the majority would be non-recombinant, leading to fewer colonies when plated on strain B, and some recombinant, leading to more colonies when plated on strain K.\n\nBut according to the results, strain B had four colonies, and strain K had four additional. So, the number of colonies for each is similar, suggesting that the recombination rate is moderate.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the percentage of recombination. To find this, we can consider the change in the number of colonies when the phages are plated on different bacteria.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N as the initial number of phages,\n- p as the recombination frequency,\n- q = 1 - p as the non-recombination frequency.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed and plated on strain B, only the non-recombination phages (lysogenic) replicate without issues, leading to fewer colonies. When plated on strain K, the recombination phages (lytic) replicate, leading to more colonies.\n\nIf we assume that initially, there are equal numbers of lysogenic and recombination phages, then after mixing, the majority would be non-recombination. Plating on strain B would result in fewer colonies because only non-recombination phages were present. Plating on strain K would result in more colonies because only recombination phages were present.\n\nThe exact calculation would depend on the recombination frequency. Given the results, if the recombination occurred at a level that allowed some phages to integrate but still produced a certain number of plasmids, the percentage could be around 0.1% or 0.2%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 0.05%, and E is 0.02%. Perhaps closer to 0.1%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when the phages are mixed, the majority become non-recombinant, leading to fewer colonies on strain B, and the recombination phages lead to more on strain K. The difference in the number of colonies reflects the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that the initial split was into two halves, with the more dilute group having lower recombination, leading to fewer colonies on strain B, and the more intense group having higher recombination, leading to more colonies on strain K.\n\nSince the question states that four colonies formed on strain B and four additional on strain K, this suggests that the recombination occurred at a level that allows some but not all phages to integrate. The exact percentage would depend on the precise calculations, but given the options, 0.1% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Given the results, if the recombination occurred at a level that allowed some phages to integrate but still produced a certain number of plasmids, the percentage could be around 0.1% or 0.2%.\n\nLooking at the options, D is 0.05%, and E is 0.02%. Perhaps closer to 0.1%, which is option D.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when the phages are mixed, the majority become non-recombinant, leading to fewer colonies on strain B, and the recombination phages lead to more on strain K. The difference in the number of colonies reflects the recombination rate.\n\nGiven that the initial split was into two halves, with the more dilute group having lower recombination, leading to fewer colonies on strain B, and the more intense group having higher recombination, leading to more colonies on strain K.\n\nSince the question states that four colonies formed on strain B and four additional on strain K, this suggests that the recombination occurred at a level that allows some but not all phages to integrate. The exact percentage would depend on the precise calculations, but given the options, 0.1% seems plausible.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.",

So, the experiment shows that some of the phages cause issues in strain B and others don't affect strain K.\n\nThe plate is split into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, there were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nRecombination refers to how often the two mutations occur together. If the mutations are linked, then a double mutant would be rare. The formula for the expected number of recombinants (double mutants) in a test cross is 1/(2N), where N is the population size, assuming random segregation. But since we're dealing with dilutions here, maybe the formula is adjusted.\n\nLet me think about the dilution factors. The first half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning each bacterium represents 1e-7 of the original culture. Similarly, the second half is 1:1e5. The total number of bacteria after dilution depends on the initial population, but since we're comparing the probabilities, perhaps we can ignore the initial population and focus on the dilution ratios.\n\nIn a double cross, the probability of getting a double mutant (both mutations occurring) is the product of the individual probabilities if the mutations are independent. Wait, no\u2014recombination affects their occurrence. Recombination reduces the likelihood of both events happening at the same time compared to independent events.\n\nWait, actually, if the two mutations are linked, the chance of a double mutant would be lower than independent events. For a double mutant, the expected frequency is 1/(2N), but since we have different dilutions, maybe it's 1/(2 * D1 * D2), where D1 and D2 are the dilution factors? Or perhaps it's more like the product of the inverse dilution factors.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution factors as the probability of selecting a bacterium with the mutation, the combined probability of both mutations is the product of the probabilities. Since the phages are selected from each half, the combined probability might be (p1 * p2), where p1 = 1/1e7 and p2 = 1/1e5. That would be 1e-12, which seems too low. But in reality, when you mix the two samples, the probability that a bacterium has both mutations isn't just the product; it's actually the product divided by the total number of possible combinations.\n\nWait, another approach: In a double cross, the probability of getting a double mutant is approximately (1/D1 + 1/D2 - 1)/(2), but I'm not sure about that. Maybe I should look up the formula for the expected number of recombinant offspring in a double cross.\n\nActually, the formula for the expected number of recombinant individuals in a double cross is given by:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) )\n\nWhere D1 and D2 are the dilution coefficients. So D1 is 1e7 and D2 is 1e5. Plugging in:\n\nE = 1 / (2 * 1e7 * 1e5) ) = 1 / (2e12) \u2248 5e-13. That's way less than what was observed, so maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. The expected number of recombinants is also influenced by the linkage. If the mutations are linked, the probability of both being present is higher than independent events. Alternatively, maybe the expected number is related to the product of the recombination fraction and the product of the selection frequencies.\n\nAnother approach: The actual number of recombinants observed is 4 on K and 40 on B. But these are counts, not probabilities. To find the recombination rate, let's consider the ratio of the expected recombinants.\n\nAssuming that the expected recombinants would be proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Let\u2019s denote p1 as the probability that a bacterium has the lysogenic phage mutation, and p2 as the probability for the lysogenic lysogen (since it's a double mutant, it's the product of both).\n\nIf the mutations are linked, the expected recombinant rate R is given by R = p1 * p2 * (1 - r), where r is the recombination fraction. But without knowing r, this complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, in a typical scenario, if the two mutations are linked, the expected number of recombinants (double mutants) would be roughly equal to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. However, in practice, this might be scaled by the dilution factors.\n\nGiven that in the experiment, the double mutant (K strain) appears 4 times, while the other half (B strain) has 40. This suggests that the proportion of double mutants is much lower in the B half than in K. Wait, but the B half had a higher dilution (1e5 instead of 1e7), so the chance of having a double mutant should be lower. Indeed, 4 out of 40 is 10%, which is lower than the 0.5% observed in strain K. Hmm, but I need to relate this to recombination.\n\nWait, another angle: The number of recombinants expected in a test cross is calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinants = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nBut without knowing r, it's tricky. Alternatively, the expected number could be approximated as (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) multiplied by the expected recombination rate.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to calculate the expected recombinants based on the observed data. Let's assume that the expected recombinants (double mutants) should be equal to the probability of a double mutant multiplied by the total number of colonies. But in our case, the total colonies are split into two halves.\n\nFirst half (diluted 1e7): Expected recombinants = P_recombinant * (1e7 / 2). Second half (diluted 1e5): Expected recombinants = P_recombinant * (1e5 / 2).\n\nFrom the experiment, the first half (diluted 1e7) didn't get any double mutants (0 found), while the second half (diluted 1e5) got 4 double mutants. So, the ratio of double mutants between the two halves is 4 : 0, but that's not helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of double mutants in the first half should be zero, indicating that either the probability is very low or the recombination fraction is high enough to make it almost impossible. The second half, with dilution 1e5, had 4 double mutants. Let's set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP = probability of a double mutant per phage type.\n\nIn the first half, the dilution is 1e7, so the probability of selecting a phage with mutation is 1e-7. Similarly, in the second half, it's 1e-5. Assuming independence, the probability of a double mutant is (1e-7) * (1e-5) = 1e-12. Then, the expected number in the first half is (1e-12) * (number of colonies in first half). But the first half had zero double mutants, implying that the expected number is close to zero, which makes sense because 1e-12 is extremely small.\n\nIn the second half, the dilution is 1e5, so the probability is 1e-5. The expected number of double mutants is (1e-5)^2 * N, where N is the number of colonies in the second half. Given that 40 double mutants were found in the second half, we can solve for N.\n\nBut wait, the total number of colonies after dilution is 1e7 / 2 in the first half and 1e5 / 2 in the second half. So, the number of colonies in the second half is (1e5 / 2) = 5e4.\n\nThus, expected double mutants in second half: (1e-5)^2 * 5e4 = (1e-10) * 5e4 = 5e-6. But in reality, it's 40 double mutants. That discrepancy indicates that my approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the expected number of double mutants is proportional to the square of the selection coefficient. In the first half, the selection coefficient S is 1e-7, so the expected double mutants would be S^2 * N, where N is the number of colonies. But in the first half, there were none, suggesting that S^2 * N is negligible.\n\nIn the second half, S is 1e-5, so the expected double mutants would be S^2 * N = (1e-5)^2 * (5e4) = 5e-6. But the actual number was 40. Clearly, this model isn't matching the observations.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Let\u2019s say that in the first half, the product is (1e-7)(1e-5) = 1e-12, leading to very few double mutants. In the second half, it's (1e-5)^2 = 1e-10, but again, that leads to very few.\n\nThis approach isn\u2019t working. Perhaps I need to use the observed numbers to estimate the recombination rate. If in the second half, there are 4 double mutants, and the first half has none, maybe the recombination rate is such that the expected double mutants in the second half is 4. Let's try that.\n\nAssume that the expected number of double mutants in the second half is 4. Using the formula E = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * R, where R is the recombination fraction. Wait, but without knowing R, it's still unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Let's compute the product of the selection coefficients for both halves.\n\nFor the first half: S1 = 1e-7, so the expected double mutants E1 = S1^2 * N1, where N1 is the number of colonies. But E1 is close to zero, so N1 must be very small. But in reality, E1 is zero, so N1 is probably tiny.\n\nFor the second half: S2 = 1e-5, so E2 = S2^2 * N2 = (1e-5)^2 * N2 = 1e-10 * N2. We know that E2 = 40, so 1e-10 * N2 = 40 => N2 = 4e11. But the total number of colonies after dilution in the second half is N2 = 1e5 / 2 = 5e4. That's a problem because 4e11 >> 5e4.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of the observed double mutants to the expected based on the dilution factors.\n\nLet me define:\n\nR = recombination rate\n\nThen, the expected number of double mutants in the first half is (1e-7) * (1e-5) * (1e7 / 2) * (1e5 / 2) * (1 - R)\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, it's (1e-5)^2 * (1e5 / 2) * (1 - R)\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. Maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nConsidering that the double mutant occurs 4 times in the second half and 0 in the first, which is four times less. Since the second half has a higher dilution factor (1e5 vs 1e7), the probability of getting a double mutant is lower there. The ratio of dilution factors squared gives us the ratio of expected double mutants.\n\n(1e5 / 1e7)^2 = (1e-2)^2 = 1e-4. So, the expected double mutants in the second half are 1e-4 times those in the first half. Since the first half had 0, the second had 4, which fits 4 = 0 * 1e4, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the observed double mutants is 4, which is 100 times more than 0. So, the recombination rate must account for that difference.\n\nGiven that the expected double mutants should decrease by a factor of (1e5 / 1e7)^2 = 1e-4, so the observed double mutants are 1e4 times more than expected. Thus, the recombination rate R is 1 / (1e4) = 0.0001, which is 0.01%. Looking back at the options, option J is 0.05%, and H is 0.02%. Hmm, 0.01% isn't an option. Closest is H (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (1e5 / 1e7) = 0.01, squared is 0.0001, so the expected double mutants in the second half should be 0.0001 times those in the first half. Since the first had 0, the second had 4, which is 4 / 0, undefined. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of double mutants observed is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. So, (S1 * S2) = (1e-7)(1e-5) = 1e-12. The observed double mutants are 40. So, 40 = k * 1e-12. Solving for k gives k=4e11. But without knowing k, this isn't useful.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients squared. So, (S1 * S2)^2 = (1e-12)^2 = 1e-24. But the observed double mutants are 40, so 40 = k * 1e-24 => k=4e23. Again, without context, this isn't helpful.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that when two mutations are linked, the expected number of double mutants is inversely proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Since the observed double mutants are 40, and the expected under independent mutations would be 1e-12 * (1e7/2 * 1e5/2) = 1e-12 * 5e8 = 5e-4. But in reality, we have 40, which is much larger. Therefore, the recombination must reduce the expected double mutants significantly. So, the recombination rate must be high enough to make the expected double mutants much smaller than observed.\n\nTo achieve an expected value of 40, we can set up the equation:\n\nExpected double mutants = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * R = 40\n\nPlugging in D1=1e7, D2=1e5:\n\n(1 / (2 * 1e7 * 1e5)) * R = 40\n\n=> (1 / 2e12) * R = 40\n\n=> R = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nThat's impossible because recombination rates are usually around 1e-8 to 1e-12. So, clearly, I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe the correct formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nSo,\n\n40 = (1 / (2 * 1e7 * 1e5)) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 40 = (1 / 2e12) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 1 - r = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nWhich is impossible. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\nBut even then, plugging in 40 would require r to be negative, which isn't physical.\n\nI think I've hit a wall here. Maybe I should refer back to basic principles. If the mutations are linked, the expected number of double mutants is lower than independent cases due to reduced recombination. The observed number of double mutants is 40, whereas in a non-linked case, it would be less. \n\nWait, the problem says that when they infect strain B, only lysogenic phage does damage. When they infect strain K, both types do. The double mutant on strain B is 40, on K is 4. So, the recombination between the two mutations must explain why the double mutant on K is fewer than on B. \n\nIn the case of linked genes, the number of double mutants decreases exponentially with recombination. Here, the double mutant count on K is 40, which is much lower than on B's 4. So, the recombination must be high enough to make the expected double mutants on K much lower.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for r:\n\nr = 1 - (2 * D1 * D2) / E\n\nHere, E is the number of double mutants. For strain K, E=40. So,\n\nr = 1 - (2 * 1e7 * 1e5) / 40\n\n= 1 - (2e12) / 40\n\n= 1 - 5e10\n\nWhich is negative, which doesn't make sense. Hence, the formula must be different.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nWith E=40,\n\n40 = (1 / (2e12)) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 1 - r = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nAgain, impossible. So, maybe the formula is inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\nBut then,\n\n40 = (1 / (2e12)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\n=> (1 - r) = 1 / (",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't lyse cells, neither mutation works.

This suggests that the proportion of double mutants is much lower in the B half than in K. Wait, but the B half had a higher dilution (1e5 instead of 1e7), so the chance of having a double mutant should be lower.

Let's assume that the expected recombinants (double mutants) should be equal to the probability of a double mutant multiplied by the total number of colonies. But in our case, the total colonies are split into two halves.\n\nFirst half (diluted 1e7): Expected recombinants = P_recombinant * (1e7 / 2). Second half (diluted 1e5): Expected recombinants = P_recombinant * (1e5 / 2).\n\nFrom the experiment, the first half (diluted 1e7) didn't get any double mutants (0 found), while the second half (diluted 1e5) got 4 double mutants. So, the ratio of double mutants between the two halves is 4 : 0, but that's not helpful directly.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of double mutants in the first half should be zero, indicating that either the probability is very low or the recombination fraction is high enough to make it almost impossible. The second half, with dilution 1e5, had 4 double mutants. Let's set up an equation.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\nP = probability of a double mutant per phage type.\n\nIn the first half, the dilution is 1e7, so the probability of selecting a phage with mutation is 1e-7. Similarly, in the second half, it's 1e-5. Assuming independence, the probability of a double mutant is (1e-7) * (1e-5) = 1e-12. Then, the expected number in the first half is (1e-12) * (number of colonies in first half). But the first half had zero double mutants, implying that the expected number is close to zero, which makes sense because 1e-12 is extremely small.\n\nIn the second half, the dilution is 1e5, so the probability is 1e-5. The expected number of double mutants is (1e-5)^2 * N, where N is the number of colonies in the second half. Given that 40 double mutants were found in the second half, we can solve for N.\n\nBut wait, the total number of colonies after dilution is 1e7 / 2 in the first half and 1e5 / 2 in the second half. So, the number of colonies in the second half is (1e5 / 2) = 5e4.\n\nThus, expected double mutants in second half: (1e-5)^2 * 5e4 = (1e-10) * 5e4 = 5e-6. But in reality, it's 40 double mutants. That discrepancy indicates that my approach is flawed.\n\nPerhaps instead, the expected number of double mutants is proportional to the square of the selection coefficient. In the first half, the selection coefficient S is 1e-7, so the expected double mutants would be S^2 * N, where N is the number of colonies. But in the first half, there were none, suggesting that S^2 * N is negligible.\n\nIn the second half, S is 1e-5, so the expected double mutants would be S^2 * N = (1e-5)^2 * (5e4) = 5e-6. But the actual number was 40. Clearly, this model isn't matching the observations.\n\nMaybe I should consider that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Let\u2019s say that in the first half, the product is (1e-7)(1e-5) = 1e-12, leading to very few double mutants. In the second half, it's (1e-5)^2 = 1e-10, but again, that leads to very few.\n\nThis approach isn\u2019t working. Perhaps I need to use the observed numbers to estimate the recombination rate. If in the second half, there are 4 double mutants, and the first half has none, maybe the recombination rate is such that the expected double mutants in the second half is 4. Let's try that.\n\nAssume that the expected number of double mutants in the second half is 4. Using the formula E = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * R, where R is the recombination fraction. Wait, but without knowing R, it's still unclear.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Let's compute the product of the selection coefficients for both halves.\n\nFor the first half: S1 = 1e-7, so the expected double mutants E1 = S1^2 * N1, where N1 is the number of colonies. But E1 is close to zero, so N1 must be very small. But in reality, E1 is zero, so N1 is probably tiny.\n\nFor the second half: S2 = 1e-5, so E2 = S2^2 * N2 = (1e-5)^2 * N2 = 1e-10 * N2. We know that E2 = 40, so 1e-10 * N2 = 40 => N2 = 4e11. But the total number of colonies after dilution in the second half is N2 = 1e5 / 2 = 5e4. That's a problem because 4e11 >> 5e4.\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that my assumptions are incorrect. Perhaps the correct approach is to use the ratio of the observed double mutants to the expected based on the dilution factors.\n\nLet me define:\n\nR = recombination rate\n\nThen, the expected number of double mutants in the first half is (1e-7) * (1e-5) * (1e7 / 2) * (1e5 / 2) * (1 - R)\n\nSimilarly, in the second half, it's (1e-5)^2 * (1e5 / 2) * (1 - R)\n\nBut this seems too convoluted. Maybe a simpler approach is needed.\n\nConsidering that the double mutant occurs 4 times in the second half and 0 in the first, which is four times less. Since the second half has a higher dilution factor (1e5 vs 1e7), the probability of getting a double mutant is lower there. The ratio of dilution factors squared gives us the ratio of expected double mutants.\n\n(1e5 / 1e7)^2 = (1e-2)^2 = 1e-4. So, the expected double mutants in the second half are 1e-4 times those in the first half. Since the first half had 0, the second had 4, which fits 4 = 0 * 1e4, but that doesn't help.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of the observed double mutants is 4, which is 100 times more than 0. So, the recombination rate must account for that difference.\n\nGiven that the expected double mutants should decrease by a factor of (1e5 / 1e7)^2 = 1e-4, so the observed double mutants are 1e4 times more than expected. Thus, the recombination rate R is 1 / (1e4) = 0.0001, which is 0.01%. Looking back at the options, option J is 0.05%, and H is 0.02%. Hmm, 0.01% isn't an option. Closest is H (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio is (1e5 / 1e7) = 0.01, squared is 0.0001, so the expected double mutants in the second half should be 0.0001 times those in the first half. Since the first had 0, the second had 4, which is 4 / 0, undefined. Not helpful.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of double mutants observed is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. So, (S1 * S2) = (1e-7)(1e-5) = 1e-12. The observed double mutants are 40. So, 40 = k * 1e-12. Solving for k gives k=4e11. But without knowing k, this isn't useful.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of double mutants is proportional to the product of the selection coefficients squared. So, (S1 * S2)^2 = (1e-12)^2 = 1e-24. But the observed double mutants are 40, so 40 = k * 1e-24 => k=4e23. Again, without context, this isn't helpful.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating it. The key is that when two mutations are linked, the expected number of double mutants is inversely proportional to the product of the selection coefficients. Since the observed double mutants are 40, and the expected under independent mutations would be 1e-12 * (1e7/2 * 1e5/2) = 1e-12 * 5e8 = 5e-4. But in reality, we have 40, which is much larger. Therefore, the recombination must reduce the expected double mutants significantly. So, the recombination rate must be high enough to make the expected double mutants much smaller than observed.\n\nTo achieve an expected value of 40, we can set up the equation:\n\nExpected double mutants = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * R = 40\n\nPlugging in D1=1e7, D2=1e5:\n\n(1 / (2 * 1e7 * 1e5)) * R = 40\n\n=> (1 / 2e12) * R = 40\n\n=> R = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nThat's impossible because recombination rates are usually around 1e-8 to 1e-12. So, clearly, I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe the correct formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nSo,\n\n40 = (1 / (2 * 1e7 * 1e5)) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 40 = (1 / 2e12) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 1 - r = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nWhich is impossible. Hence, this approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula should be:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\nBut even then, plugging in 40 would require r to be negative, which isn't physical.\n\nI think I've hit a wall here. Maybe I should refer back to basic principles. If the mutations are linked, the expected number of double mutants is lower than independent cases due to reduced recombination. The observed number of double mutants is 40, whereas in a non-linked case, it would be less. \n\nWait, the problem says that when they infect strain B, only lysogenic phage does damage. When they infect strain K, both types do. The double mutant on strain B is 40, on K is 4. So, the recombination between the two mutations must explain why the double mutant on K is fewer than on B. \n\nIn the case of linked genes, the number of double mutants decreases exponentially with recombination. Here, the double mutant count on K is 40, which is much lower than on B's 4. So, the recombination must be high enough to make the expected double mutants on K much lower.\n\nUsing the formula:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nWe can rearrange to solve for r:\n\nr = 1 - (2 * D1 * D2) / E\n\nHere, E is the number of double mutants. For strain K, E=40. So,\n\nr = 1 - (2 * 1e7 * 1e5) / 40\n\n= 1 - (2e12) / 40\n\n= 1 - 5e10\n\nWhich is negative, which doesn't make sense. Hence, the formula must be different.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 - r)\n\nWith E=40,\n\n40 = (1 / (2e12)) * (1 - r)\n\n=> 1 - r = 40 * 2e12 = 8e13\n\nAgain, impossible. So, maybe the formula is inverted.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula is:\n\nE = (1 / (2 * D1 * D2)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\nBut then,\n\n40 = (1 / (2e12)) * (1 / (1 - r))\n\n=> (1 - r) = 1 / (",

Half of them caused strain B to be saturated (lysed), and the other half didn't affect B at all. Then these plasmids were dilated (stirred) into different concentrations before being plated on a lawn of strain B and another lawn of strain K. \n\nFrom the results, four colonies grew on the B lawn when plated with the first concentration (diluted 1:10^7), and four more on the K lawn when plated with the second concentration (diluted 1:10^5). So, the first concentration was effective against B but not K, and the second concentration was effective against K but not B. This suggests that the mutations cause recombination within each plating set.\n\nWait, no, actually, the phages themselves have their own mutations. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse the cell, so maybe it's causing recombination within the phage itself? Or perhaps it's affecting the host phage differently. Hmm.\n\nLet me think about how the tests work. If you plate a phage on a lawn of E. coli, and the phage doesn't lyse the cells, then the host phage takes over, right? So if the mutation is in the phage's own DNA, like causing recombination within the phage, then it would affect whether the phage can replicate or not. But wait, the question says the mutations are in the genomic region called rII. That could refer to the host phage's DNA, which might influence its own replication or virulence.\n\nBut the key here is that when you plate the mutant phages on strain B, only the lysogenic phage affects B, meaning that the lysogenic phage must have some effect on the host. So perhaps the lysogenic phage has a mutation that prevents it from integrating into the host phage's genome, thereby disrupting the host's ability to take over the phage. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage may have a mutation that allows it to replicate better without causing a split in the host phage, hence leading to lysis.\n\nWait, no, the lysogenic phage usually integrates into the host phage's genome and becomes a prophage. If there's a mutation in the lysogenic phage's DNA, it might prevent it from replicating properly or from integrating into the host. Alternatively, it might allow the lysogenic phage to replicate more efficiently without causing lysis.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage in the lysed B cells must have an effect on the host phage's replication, preventing it from taking over. Similarly, the lysogenic phage in the non-lysed B cells might not have that effect, while the same lysogenic phage in the K cells might not have any effect, or vice versa.\n\nNow, the experiment involves two types of mutantphages: one that causes lysogeny (so it integrates into the host) and one that doesn't (so it doesn't integrate). These are mixed together. When they are placed on strain B, only the lysogenic phage causes B to lyse, as expected. However, when placed on strain K, neither type of phage does anything because the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis in K.\n\nSo, what's happening here is that the lysogenic phage's mutation is responsible for causing lysis in B but not in K. Therefore, the mutation in the lysogenic phage is specific to B and not present in K. Since the lysogenic phage's DNA contains the mutation, we can infer that the recombination during the phage's replication is occurring within the phage itself, specifically in the lysogenic form.\n\nRecombination refers to changes in the DNA sequence of the phage. In this case, the lysogenic phage must have integrated into the host's genome, causing a change in the host's DNA (recombination) that prevents it from replicating and taking over the phage. So the number of recombinant events in the lysogenic phage should correspond to the percentage of recombination.\n\nTo calculate this, we can use the formula:\n\nPercentage of Recombination = (Number of Recombinant Events / Total Number of Events) * 100\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is on strain B, only one event occurs where the phage mutates (the lysogenic form doesn't lyse, implying recombination occurred in the lysogenic phage). When it's on strain K, none of the lysogenic phages cause a mutation, meaning that the recombination did not occur in the lysogenic phage. However, since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis in B, it implies that the recombination happened in the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, no. If the lysogenic phage in B causes recombination, then it wouldn't cause lysis. So, the lysogenic phage in B is recombining once (assuming each phage has one mutation), while in K, it doesn't recombine, so it doesn't cause lysis either. Wait, but in our experiment, the lysogenic phage on B caused lysis, meaning it didn't recombine. On K, it didn't cause lysis because it didn't recombine.\n\nThis seems conflicting. Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause recombination, it doesn't lyse, so it shouldn't cause any issues. But according to the problem, the lysogenic phage on B does cause lysis, meaning it must have recombined. So, when it's on B, it recombines, allowing it to replicate without lysis. When it's on K, it doesn't recombine, so it cannot replicate, and thus B is lysed.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phage on B has one recombination event (mutation), whereas on K, it has zero recombination events. So, the percentage of recombination is 100% for the lysogenic phage in B and 0% in K.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. Oh, wait, perhaps it's asking about the recombination within the T_4 phage, not just in the lysogenic form.\n\nHmm, this complicates things. Because the T_4 phage has multiple copies of the rII region, and mutations could lead to double-stranded regions or other issues. Perhaps the issue is about how the two mutant phages interact and affect each other.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the two mutations are in different phages. One causes lysogeny in B and the other causes lysogeny in K. The recombination refers to the point where the two mutations happen, such that they disrupt the interaction between the two phages.\n\nWait, the problem states that the two types of mutantphages are both carrying mutations in the rII region. They are mixed and placed on B and K. The result is that B is halved when the first concentration is used, and K is halved when the second concentration is used.\n\nSo, the first concentration (diluted 1:10^7) causes B to be halved, indicating that the lysogenic phage in this concentration is causing B to lyse. The second concentration (diluted 1:10^5) causes K to be halved, meaning that the lysogenic phage in this concentration is not causing K to lyse.\n\nThus, the lysogenic phage in the first concentration has a mutation that causes it to lyse B, while the same lysogenic phage in the second concentration does not cause it to lyse K. This indicates that the mutation in the lysogenic phage is specific to B, not K. Therefore, the recombination happens within the lysogenic phage, specifically in the lysogenic form.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage has one mutation (a recombination event), the percentage of recombination is 100%. But this doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back, the answer choices are percentages like 1%, 2%, etc., up to 5% and even 0.02%. So, perhaps I'm miscalculating.\n\nAnother approach: The amount of recombination is determined by the number of times the two mutations occur in the same region. Each mutation introduces a new sequence, and their combination creates a double-stranded region. The percentage of recombination is calculated based on how much overlap there is between the sequences.\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage is on B, it has one mutation. When it's on K, it has zero. So, the recombination is 100% for the lysogenic phage in B and 0% in K. But the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, perhaps the recombination refers to the point where the two mutant phages' mutations interfere with each other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is referring to the recombination within the T_4 phage, not just the lysogenic form. If the two mutant phages have their own mutations, they might cause interference in their replication, leading to reduced efficiency.\n\nWait, let's consider the possible answers. The options are fractions of a percent, ranging from 0.02% to 5%. This suggests that the percentage of recombination is small. Perhaps the recombination refers to a specific site within the T_4 phage's genome, such as a base pair or a nucleotide change.\n\nGiven that, the amount of recombination would depend on the likelihood that the two mutations occur at the same location. If the two mutations are close together, the probability of recombination is higher. Conversely, if they are far apart, the chance of recombination is lower.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are in the same gene, the percentage of recombination can be estimated using the formula:\n\nPercentage of Recombination = (Distance between Mutations) / (Length of Gene)\n\nIf the distance is small relative to the gene length, the percentage will be low.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the smallest fraction is 0.02%, which corresponds to approximately 1 base pair per 50 nt (since 1/50 \u2248 0.02%). This suggests that the two mutations are very close to each other.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is likely F. 0.3 percent, but that's larger than 0.02%. Alternatively, E. 0.05 percent (about 1 base pair per 200 nt) or D. 0.02 percent (about 1 base pair per 500 nt).\n\nGiven that, and considering the experimental data, the percentage of recombination is likely around 0.02%, making option E the closest.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

One set is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. The results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let's break this down. Recombination refers to how different mutations affect each other within a gene. If there's no recombination, the two mutations would work independently; if there is some recombination, their effects might interact or influence each other's activity. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is good for strain B because it doesn't lyse it, but the same phage isn't effective against strain K. So maybe the mutation in K is recombining with the lysogenic phage in B? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage has another mutation affecting B?\n\nWait, actually, the phage that's causing issues is the lysogenic one, right? Because the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse the cell) is the one that affects strain K. So the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that makes it ineffective against strain B. This suggests that there's a recombination between the lysogenic phage's mutation and the mutation present in strain B. \n\nSo if the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with the mutation from strain B, then when you mix them together, the effect would be lost. That means that the lysogenic phage can now lyse E. coli strain B because its mutation interacts with the existing mutation in B. \n\nNow, the experiment shows that when the phage is mixed into strain B's lawn at a higher dilution (1:10^7), only a small number of pluses form (40 out of 1e9 cells). But when it's mixed into strain K's lawn at a lower dilution (1:1e5), more pluses form (40 out of 1e5 cells). \n\nThis indicates that the recombination happened because when the phage is mixed into strain B's lawn, the interaction leads to a loss of function. So the recombination frequency would determine how often these interactions occur. \n\nRecombination frequency is typically measured as the percentage of time when two mutations interfere with each other. In this context, the presence of an additional mutation in the lysogenic phage caused by recombination explains why the phage works better in strain K but not in B. \n\nGiven the data, the recombination seems to occur frequently enough to explain the difference in outcome between the two plating sets. Since the number of pluses increased in the K plating set, it suggests that the recombination occurred more than once or in significant proportion. \n\nLooking at the options, D is 0.05%, C is 1.5%, F is 0.3%. Among these, the highest percentage given is 1.5% (option C). However, I'm not sure if 1.5% is correct here. More commonly, such recombinant frequencies are around 2-3%. But since the answer choices don't include 1.5%, perhaps the closest is option C (1.5%) or option G (0.5%). Wait, but my initial thought was towards 1.5%.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when the phage is mixed into strain B's lawn at a high dilution, fewer pluses form, implying less interference. At low dilution, more pluses form, indicating more interference. So the recombination frequency is about 1/3 or 33%, which would correspond to approximately 3%, but the closest option is G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me think again. If the recombination occurs, the effect of the phage on strain B disappears in the presence of strain B's mutation, but remains in the absence of strain B's mutation. \n\nIn the first plating set (strain B's lawn), higher dilution (1:1e7) means fewer cells to check. The 40 pluses are a small fraction, suggesting that the recombination happens frequently. \n\nAt lower dilution (1:1e5), the higher fraction (40 out of 1e5) suggests that recombination is happening more often. So the ratio of pluses in the high dilution vs. low dilution gives us the recombination frequency. \n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (rf) is:\n\nrf = (number of recombined offspring / total offspring)\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with counts across plating sets. Alternatively, the frequency can be estimated as the ratio of pluses at low dilution to those at high dilution. \n\nSo rf = (pluses at low dilution) / (total pluses) )\n\nTotal pluses = pluses at high dilution + pluses at low dilution = 40 + 400 = 440? Wait, no, wait. Wait, in the first plating set, 40 pluses were found, and in the second, 40 pluses. But the second plating set had a lower dilution, meaning more plasmids per cell, so more chances for recombination. So perhaps the total pluses are 40 + 40 = 80? No, wait, the first set has 40 pluses, and the second has 40 pluses as well. But the first set is at a higher dilution, so fewer plasmids per cell, thus fewer checks. \n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think in terms of the expected number of pluses. Normally, without any recombination, you'd expect each plating set to give a certain number of pluses. With recombination, the number increases. The increase tells us the frequency. \n\nIf the recombination frequency is r, the expected number of pluses in the high dilution (high concentration, so fewer cells) should be lower, and in the low dilution (lower concentration, more cells), it should be higher. \n\nLet me use the formula for the number of recombined plasmids:\n\nNumber of plasmids with recombination = N * (1 - e^{-r})\n\nWhere N is the total number of plasmids, and r is the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming N is large, e^{-r} \u2248 1 - r, so 1 - e^{-r} \u2248 r.\n\nThus, the expected number of recombined plasmids is roughly r*N.\n\nBut in our case, the plating sets have varying concentrations, so the actual number depends on how many plasmids are present. However, since we don't know N, perhaps we can assume that the majority of plasmids come from the lower dilution set, where recombination is more likely.\n\nFrom the data:\n- High dilution (1:1e7): 40 pluses.\n- Low dilution (1:1e5): 40 pluses.\n\nTotal plasmids checked: 40 + 40 = 80.\n\nBut wait, the high dilution set has fewer plasmids, so each cell has more chance of containing a recombined plasmid. Therefore, the expected number of recombined plasmids in the high dilution set would be less than in the low dilution set.\n\nIf we consider that the recombination is happening at a rate r, then the probability that a randomly selected plasmid from the high dilution set is recombined is r. Similarly, for the low dilution set.\n\nThe expected number of recombined plasmids in the high dilution set would be (number of plasmids in high dilution set) * r.\n\nSimilarly, in the low dilution set, it would be (number of plasmids in low dilution set) * r.\n\nBut without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky. However, the key point is that the number of recombined plasmids is higher in the low dilution set, which supports the idea that recombination occurs frequently enough to lead to more plasmids being recombined in the lower dilution set.\n\nGiven the options, 1.5% (C) or 0.5% (F) are close. But looking back, the recombination frequency can also be calculated using the formula:\n\n rf = (number of recombined plasmids) / (total plasmids) )\n\nBut without knowing the exact distribution, it's hard. However, the fact that the recombination leads to fewer pluses in the high dilution set suggests that recombination is occurring often. \n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of plasmids that are affected due to recombination. For example, if the recombination frequency is 1%, then in the high dilution set, which has fewer plasmids, say 100 plasmids, only 1 would be recombined. Then, the expected number of affected plasmids would be lower, leading to fewer pluses. Conversely, in the low dilution set, with more plasmids, like 1000, more could be recombined, leading to more pluses.\n\nBut without precise numbers, it's challenging. However, among the options, 1.5% (C) is the most plausible because it aligns with the idea that recombination is frequent enough to account for the observed differences in plating outcomes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't cause that issue, both phages are okay. \n\nThe experiment involves two plating sets. One set is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn. The other is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. The results show four pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nHmm, so let's break this down. Recombination refers to how different mutations affect each other within a gene. If there's no recombination, the two mutations would work independently; if there is some recombination, their effects might interact or influence each other's activity. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage is good for strain B because it doesn't lyse it, but the same phage isn't effective against strain K. So maybe the mutation in K is recombining with the lysogenic phage in B? Or perhaps the lysogenic phage has another mutation affecting B?\n\nWait, actually, the phage that's causing issues is the lysogenic one, right? Because the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse the cell) is the one that affects strain K. So the lysogenic phage must have a mutation that makes it ineffective against strain B. This suggests that there's a recombination between the lysogenic phage's mutation and the mutation present in strain B. \n\nSo if the lysogenic phage's mutation is recombined with the mutation from strain B, then when you mix them together, the effect would be lost. That means that the lysogenic phage can now lyse E. coli strain B because its mutation interacts with the existing mutation in B. \n\nNow, the experiment shows that when the phage is mixed into strain B's lawn at a higher dilution (1:10^7), only a small number of pluses form (40 out of 1e9 cells). But when it's mixed into strain K's lawn at a lower dilution (1:1e5), more pluses form (40 out of 1e5 cells). \n\nThis indicates that the recombination happened because when the phage is mixed into strain B's lawn, the interaction leads to a loss of function. So the recombination frequency would determine how often these interactions occur. \n\nRecombination frequency is typically measured as the percentage of time when two mutations interfere with each other. In this context, the presence of an additional mutation in the lysogenic phage caused by recombination explains why the phage works better in strain K but not in B. \n\nGiven the data, the recombination seems to occur frequently enough to explain the difference in outcome between the two plating sets.

In the end, four colonies form pluses on K and 40 on B. \n\nWait, how does this work? If you dilute the phages more, you're reducing their chance of infecting cells. Diluting 1:10^7 means each cell has fewer phages, so the probability of infection is lower. Plating them on the same strain would mean that if enough phages infect, some might lyse or not, depending on the mutation.\n\nBut since the lysogenic phage isn't affected by strain B, only the lytic one affects strain B. So when you dilute the lysogenic ones more, maybe their effect on the lytic ones becomes apparent. Wait, no\u2014strain B doesn't lyse, so any phages that infect it must be lysogenic. So, if you dilute the lysogenic phages (which affect only strain K), perhaps the number of successful infections changes.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes. Without any mutation, all phages would kill the E. coli. With the lysogenic phage causing damage, only strain K gets damaged. So when you plate the lysogenic ones on strain B, none should die, but those that do might lyse, killing the bacteria. However, the lysogenic phages themselves aren't affected by strain B; their effect is dependent on the host's response.\n\nWait, but the experiment involves dilution before plating. If the lysogenic phages are more numerous when diluted 1:10^7, then their chance of infecting cells increases. Each cell could have multiple phages. The number of phages per cell determines whether the lysogenic (good) or lytic (bad) will cause death. \n\nIn the first case, half the colonies are treated with 1:10^7 lysogenic phages. If each cell has multiple phages, the number that actually infects depends on the dilution factor. For example, if each cell has 1e6 phages, diluting to 1e7 would reduce the effective concentration to 1 per cell, meaning every cell has exactly one phage. If the lysogenic phage is effective, all cells die, but wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it's safe for strain B but not for K. So when you plate these on strain B, the lysogenic phages shouldn't cause death because they don't lyse. But if the lysogenic phages are effective, then any cells that receive them won't die, leading to more plating on strain B.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phages are effective against strain K, then when you plate them on strain B, they would lyse strain B, leading to deaths. So let's model this:\n\nFor the lysogenic phages (let's say they have mutation X):\n\n- If they are effective against strain K (so they kill it), then when you plate on strain B, all lysogenic phages would lyse strain B, causing deaths.\n- If they are not effective, then only some cells with phages that don't lyse (or lyse?) would survive.\n\nSimilarly, for the lytic phage (mutation Y):\n\n- It kills the cell regardless of its origin.\n- If it's active against strain B (mutant Z), then when you plate on strain B, all lysogenic phages would lyse, causing deaths.\n- If it's not active, then some cells would die, others wouldn't.\n\nBut in the experiment, half the colonies are treated with 1:1e7 lysogenic phages, and the other half with 1:1e5. Then these are plated on strain B and K respectively.\n\nThe results were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. Plus signs indicate successful replication, so plasmids integrated into the chromosome.\n\nIf the lysogenic phages are effective at killing strain K, then when they are plated on strain B, all would lyse, leading to high plating. But the results here are low\u2014only 40 vs 4. That suggests that not all lysogenic phages are effective. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phages are not effective against strain B, then only some cells would lyse, leading to fewer plasmas.\n\nWait, let's think about the numbers. After treating the lysogenic phages with 1:1e7, and then plating on strain B, the number of plasmas is 40. Without treatment, it's 4. The ratio is 10 times higher. That suggests that the number of viable phages increased by a factor of 10, which would happen if the treatment with phages killed off many, leaving fewer susceptible ones. Or perhaps the treatment reduced the chance of phages infecting, making more cells survive.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phages are effective against strain K, then when plated on strain B, all would lyse, leading to more plasmas than without treatment. But here, it's only 40, which is much less than 4e2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the treatment reduces the number of phages per cell, increasing the chance that they infect. If the lysogenic phages are effective, then even with reduced phage density, they would still kill, leading to high plating. But the results show lower plating, suggesting that the phages aren't as effective as assumed.\n\nAnother angle: the experiment uses two different dilutions. When treating the lysogenic phages with 1:1e7, the number of phages per cell is halved, making it harder for them to infect. This may increase the likelihood of cells surviving, allowing some phages to replicate inside. When they're plated on strain B, this may lead to more plasmas because the phages are present in more copies within the cells.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant activity. The amount of recombination can be estimated using the equation:\n\nR = (m + n - m*n)/(m + n)\n\nwhere m is the frequency of the mutant in the population and n is the frequency in another sample. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids detected. If the lysogenic phage has a certain degree of recombination, then during replication, it may integrate with the host's DNA, creating a new plasmid. The number of such plasmids would depend on the efficiency of recombination and the number of replicative divisions.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the probability of recombination. Since the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) caused strain B to die (i.e., X is lethal against B), and the lysogenic phage with mutation Y (assuming it's a new mutation) didn't cause strain B to die, indicating no recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Since the lysogenic phage with mutation X was lethal to strain B, and the other phage (mutation Y) didn't cause lethality, that suggests no recombination occurred between X and Y.\n\nSo the amount of recombination would be zero. Looking back at the options, option J says 0.05%, which seems too small, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is D, 0.1%. Because sometimes recombinants are expressed at a certain rate, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the calculation considers the efficiency of integrating the new mutation into the host's genome.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plasmids detected (plus signs) can give an estimate of the number of independent replicons. If there are R independent replicons, then the proportion of recombination is approximately 1/R. But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is C, 1.5%, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the correct answer might be D, 0.1%.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. If the lysogenic phages are effectively lethal to strain K but not to B, that suggests that the second mutation (Y) did not interfere with the first mutation (X). Therefore, there's no recombination. So the amount of recombination is zero, which corresponds to option J (0.05%) or D (0.1%). Hmm.\n\nBut I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem states that when the lysogenic phage (mutation X) is used alone, it causes strain B to die, but when combined with a lytic phage (mutation Y), it doesn't affect strain B. So the presence of mutation Y doesn't cause lethality against B, implying that Y doesn't recombine with X. Therefore, there's no recombination, so the amount is zero.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.1%, and J is 0.05%. Zero isn't listed, so perhaps the closest is D (0.1%) or J (0.05%). But my reasoning suggests zero, so maybe the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination occurs in the lysogenic phage, which integrates into the host genome. If the lysogenic phage carries a new mutation that allows it to integrate into the host's genome, causing a recombination event, then the plasmids would integrate, leading to recombinant plasmids.\n\nThe number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the efficiency of integration and the number of replicative cycles. If the phage had a high degree of recombination, more plasmids would have been integrated, leading to higher detection rates.\n\nGiven the data, the number of plasmids detected on strain B was 40, and on strain K was 4. If there's a significant degree of recombination, the plasmids would be more likely to integrate into the host's genome, affecting the results.\n\nWithout precise calculations, it's hard to determine the exact percentage. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D (0.1%).\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to consider the multiplicative factors. The number of plasmids detected is proportional to the number of independent replicons. If there's complete recombination, the number of plasmids would be higher, leading to more detection.\n\nBut without knowing the specific number of plasmids, it's challenging. Given the lack of data, I'll go with D (0.1%).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So let's model this:\n\nFor the lysogenic phages (let's say they have mutation X):\n\n- If they are effective against strain K (so they kill it), then when you plate on strain B, all lysogenic phages would lyse strain B, causing deaths.\n- If they are not effective, then only some cells with phages that don't lyse (or lyse?) would survive.\n\nSimilarly, for the lytic phage (mutation Y):\n\n- It kills the cell regardless of its origin.\n- If it's active against strain B (mutant Z), then when you plate on strain B, all lysogenic phages would lyse, causing deaths.\n- If it's not active, then some cells would die, others wouldn't.\n\nBut in the experiment, half the colonies are treated with 1:1e7 lysogenic phages, and the other half with 1:1e5. Then these are plated on strain B and K respectively.\n\nThe results were 4 pluses on K and 40 on B. Plus signs indicate successful replication, so plasmids integrated into the chromosome.\n\nIf the lysogenic phages are effective at killing strain K, then when they are plated on strain B, all would lyse, leading to high plating. But the results here are low\u2014only 40 vs 4. That suggests that not all lysogenic phages are effective. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phages are not effective against strain B, then only some cells would lyse, leading to fewer plasmas.\n\nWait, let's think about the numbers. After treating the lysogenic phages with 1:1e7, and then plating on strain B, the number of plasmas is 40. Without treatment, it's 4. The ratio is 10 times higher. That suggests that the number of viable phages increased by a factor of 10, which would happen if the treatment with phages killed off many, leaving fewer susceptible ones. Or perhaps the treatment reduced the chance of phages infecting, making more cells survive.\n\nAlternatively, if the lysogenic phages are effective against strain K, then when plated on strain B, all would lyse, leading to more plasmas than without treatment. But here, it's only 40, which is much less than 4e2. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps the treatment reduces the number of phages per cell, increasing the chance that they infect. If the lysogenic phages are effective, then even with reduced phage density, they would still kill, leading to high plating. But the results show lower plating, suggesting that the phages aren't as effective as assumed.\n\nAnother angle: the experiment uses two different dilutions. When treating the lysogenic phages with 1:1e7, the number of phages per cell is halved, making it harder for them to infect. This may increase the likelihood of cells surviving, allowing some phages to replicate inside. When they're plated on strain B, this may lead to more plasmas because the phages are present in more copies within the cells.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit confused. Maybe I should use the formula for recombinant activity. The amount of recombination can be estimated using the equation:\n\nR = (m + n - m*n)/(m + n)\n\nwhere m is the frequency of the mutant in the population and n is the frequency in another sample. But I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the number of plasmids detected. If the lysogenic phage has a certain degree of recombination, then during replication, it may integrate with the host's DNA, creating a new plasmid. The number of such plasmids would depend on the efficiency of recombination and the number of replicative divisions.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to calculate the probability of recombination. Since the lysogenic phage (with mutation X) caused strain B to die (i.e., X is lethal against B), and the lysogenic phage with mutation Y (assuming it's a new mutation) didn't cause strain B to die, indicating no recombination.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Since the lysogenic phage with mutation X was lethal to strain B, and the other phage (mutation Y) didn't cause lethality, that suggests no recombination occurred between X and Y.\n\nSo the amount of recombination would be zero. Looking back at the options, option J says 0.05%, which seems too small, but maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is D, 0.1%. Because sometimes recombinants are expressed at a certain rate, but I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, maybe the calculation considers the efficiency of integrating the new mutation into the host's genome.\n\nAnother thought: the number of plasmids detected (plus signs) can give an estimate of the number of independent replicons. If there are R independent replicons, then the proportion of recombination is approximately 1/R. But I'm not sure about the exact relationship.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended answer is C, 1.5%, but I'm not fully confident. Alternatively, the correct answer might be D, 0.1%.\n\nWait, let me try another approach. If the lysogenic phages are effectively lethal to strain K but not to B, that suggests that the second mutation (Y) did not interfere with the first mutation (X). Therefore, there's no recombination. So the amount of recombination is zero, which corresponds to option J (0.05%) or D (0.1%). Hmm.\n\nBut I think I made a mistake earlier. The problem states that when the lysogenic phage (mutation X) is used alone, it causes strain B to die, but when combined with a lytic phage (mutation Y), it doesn't affect strain B. So the presence of mutation Y doesn't cause lethality against B, implying that Y doesn't recombine with X. Therefore, there's no recombination, so the amount is zero.\n\nLooking back at the options, D is 0.1%, and J is 0.05%. Zero isn't listed, so perhaps the closest is D (0.1%) or J (0.05%). But my reasoning suggests zero, so maybe the intended answer is D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination occurs in the lysogenic phage, which integrates into the host genome. If the lysogenic phage carries a new mutation that allows it to integrate into the host's genome, causing a recombination event, then the plasmids would integrate, leading to recombinant plasmids.\n\nThe number of recombinant plasmids would depend on the efficiency of integration and the number of replicative cycles. If the phage had a high degree of recombination, more plasmids would have been integrated, leading to higher detection rates.\n\nGiven the data, the number of plasmids detected on strain B was 40, and on strain K was 4. If there's a significant degree of recombination, the plasmids would be more likely to integrate into the host's genome, affecting the results.\n\nWithout precise calculations, it's hard to determine the exact percentage. But given the options, perhaps the intended answer is D (0.1%).\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely confident. Another approach is to consider the multiplicative factors. The number of plasmids detected is proportional to the number of independent replicons. If there's complete recombination, the number of plasmids would be higher, leading to more detection.\n\nBut without knowing the specific number of plasmids, it's challenging. Given the lack of data, I'll go with D (0.1%).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Wait, no\u2014wait, let me think again. If the phage is lysogenic, it should replicate inside the cell and not lyse it, right? So if you have a strain B plate and treat it with the lysogenic phage, you'd expect some colonies because the phage isn't causing the cell to lyse. However, the problem says that when treated with the lysogenic phage, only the lysogenic phage does something bad\u2014so perhaps the lysogenic phage kills all the cells, while the lysogenic phage itself doesn't do anything? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage causes the lysis of strain B but not of strain K. So when strain B is plated with the lysogenic phage, there are colonies (meaning the phage didn't lyse the bacteria), and when strain B is plated with the lysogenic phage (which shouldn't cause any issues?), wait, no\u2014maybe I'm mixing up. Let me read again: \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause the lysis of strain B of E. coli but not of strain K.\"\n\nSo when strain B is plated with the phage, the lysogenic phage (with mutation) leads to lyosis, meaning the phage killed the bacteria. But when strain B is plated with another type of phage (without mutation?), or is it that when strain B is plated with the lysogenic phage, it dies, and without mutation, it might survive?\n\nWait, I'm getting tangled. Let me clarify:\n\n- Two types of phages: one with mutation in rII (let's call it Phage X), and another without mutation (Phage Y).\n\n- When Phage X is present along with strain B, it causes lyosis (so the phage replicates inside the bacterium and destroys it).\n\n- When Phage Y is present along with strain B, it doesn't cause lyosis; however, when Phage Y is used alone, it doesn't lyse strain K either.\n\nNow, the experiment steps:\n\n1. Plate strain B with both Phage X and Y.\n\n2. Dilute the mixture and plate on a lawn of strain B. Half die, half don't.\n\n3. Dilute 1:10^7 further and plate on strain K. Other half dies, and four plotes are found on K, 40 on B.\n\nWait, the results are a bit confusing. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, when strain B is plated with both Phages X and Y, half the plates die due to X (lysis), and half don't die because Y works fine. Then these plates are diluted 1:10^7 and placed on strain K. The number of plotes that form colonies depends on whether the phages caused lyosis in those regions. Since the original sample had half dead and half alive, when dilution occurs, more cells will be exposed, leading to higher survival rates. However, the problem states that when the other half is diluted and placed on strain K, 4 plotes are found on K and 40 on B. That suggests that the presence of the phage Y on strain K resulted in more colonies than on strain B, indicating that Y was more effective at killing cells on strain K than on strain B.\n\nBut wait, actually, when the first half (where X was present) were placed on strain B, half died. When these same plates were placed on strain K, more survived because Y worked better on K. Conversely, when the second half (Y-only) was placed on strain B, none died because Y didn't lyse B. Similarly, when Y was placed on K, Y didn't lyse K, so all cells would survive.\n\nBut according to the results, when the first half (X+Y) were placed on strain B, half died (lysed), and half survived (Y did nothing). Then these were diluted and placed on strain K. On strain K, 40% of the colonies grew, and 60% didn't. This indicates that the presence of the phage Y increased the probability of survival on strain K compared to strain B. Because when the phage Y is present, it works better on strain K than on strain B, as seen by the higher proportion of colonies surviving on K.\n\nTo quantify this, we can use the formula for recombination frequency (RF):\n\nRF = (p + q - pq)/p\n\nWhere p and q are allele frequencies. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the observed survival rate and compare it to the expected survival rates without recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the survival rate on strain B would be equal to the survival rate on strain K, since the mutations don't affect each other. With recombination, the survival rates differ.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S_B = survival rate on strain B (when X is present)\n- S_K = survival rate on strain K (when Y is present)\n\nWhen both X and Y are present, the overall survival rate is:\n\nS_total = (S_X * S_Y) / (S_X + S_Y - S_X*S_Y)\n\nBut since the phage X causes lyosis, its survival rate on strain B is zero, and on strain K, it's whatever it is. Similarly, phage Y's survival rate on strain B is 1 (since it doesn't cause lyosis), and on strain K, it's S_K.\n\nHowever, since the phage X affects strain B differently from strain K, their survival rates are different. The key is to determine how much the presence of the phage Y improves the survival on strain K compared to strain B.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed (X and Y), half the plates die (on strain B due to X), and half survive (due to Y). These are then placed on strain K. Of these, 40% grow, suggesting that the presence of phage Y increases the survival rate on strain K beyond what would happen with phage Y alone on strain K.\n\nAlternatively, when the phages are isolated and placed on strain K, 40% of the plates result in colonies. This implies that the combination of phages improved the survival on strain K more than just using phage Y alone.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is high. To find the exact percentage, we can set up equations based on the survival rates.\n\nAssume that:\n\n- Without phage X, the survival rate on strain K is s.\n- Without phage Y, the survival rate on strain B is t.\n- With both phages present, the survival rate on strain K is s'.\n\nWe know that when both phages are present, half the plates die on strain B (because X causes lyosis), and half survive on strain K (because Y works well on K). After dilution, these become 80% (0.8) on strain B and 20% (0.2) on strain K.\n\nOn strain K, 40% of the colonies grow, which corresponds to the survival rate of 0.2.\n\nSimilarly, when phage Y is used alone on strain K, the survival rate is s' = 0.2.\n\nNow, when phage Y is used alone on strain B, the survival rate is t = 0.0 (since Y doesn't lyse B, but actually, in the initial plate, when X is present, Y doesn't lyse B, so t=0.0? Or wait, no\u2014if Y is the only phage, and X is present, the phage Y doesn't lyse B, so t=0.0, but the phage X causes lyosis on B, so t=0.0.\n\nBut when both phages are present on B, 50% die (due to X), so t=0.5.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- t_X: survival rate of phage X on strain B (i.e., if X is present alone on B, t_X is the fraction of cells that survive).\n- t_Y: survival rate of phage Y on strain K (if Y is present alone on K, t_Y is the fraction that survives).\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, the survival rate is (t_X * t_Y) / (t_X + t_Y - t_X*t_Y). But since X causes lyosis on B, t_X=0.0, so the survival rate becomes 0.0 * t_Y / ... = 0.0. Which matches the data: half the plates die on B.\n\nWhen both phages are present on K, the survival rate is (t_Y * t_Y) / (t_Y + t_Y - t_Y*t_Y) )? Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should consider the combined effect.\n\nAlternatively, the survival rate when both phages are present is:\n\nS_total = (t_Y) / (t_Y + (1 - t_Y)) )\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn\u2019t make sense. Let me think about it differently.\n\nIf X is present alone on B, it causes lyosis, so survival rate t_X = 0.0.\n\nIf Y is present alone on K, it doesn't cause lyosis, so survival rate t_Y = 1.0.\n\nBut when both are present, the survival rate depends on both. If X is present, it kills cells, so survival rate for cells with X is 0.0, regardless of Y. For cells without X (which is all cells except those where X is present), Y acts, so survival rate is t_Y.\n\nThus, the overall survival rate when both are present is:\n\nS_total = (0.0 * N + t_Y * (N - N_X)) / N\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nS_total = t_Y * (1 - N_X/N )\n\nBut since N_X/N is the fraction of cells with X, which is (number with X)/(total number) = (N/2)/N = 0.5.\n\nSo,\n\nS_total = t_Y * (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 * t_Y\n\nFrom the experiment, when both phages are present on B, half the plates die, meaning survival rate is 0.5. So:\n\n0.5 = 0.5 * t_Y => t_Y = 1.0\n\nWait, that can't be right because if t_Y is 1.0, then when Y is present on K, all cells survive, which contradicts the fact that when both X and Y are present on K, only 40% survive, implying that Y alone gives higher survival.\n\nHmm, I must be missing something here. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, 50% die (due to X), so survival rate is 0.5. This means that the presence of X reduces the survival rate by 0.5 (from 1.0 to 0.5). Now, when both phages are present on K, the survival rate is 0.2 (as per the data: 40% colonies on K, which is 0.4, but wait, the total is 80% on B and 20% on K. Wait, no\u2014the total is 80% on B, which includes 50% death due to X, and 30% survival, but when placed on K, the 30% survive, giving 0.3 on K and 0.5 on B. But the problem states that 40% of the K plates result in colonies, meaning that 40% of the 20% (since 1:10^7 dilution) survive, which is 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the experiment steps:\n\n1. Plate strain B with both X and Y.\n\n   - Half of the plates die (lyse due to X), and half survive.\n\n   - These 50% survive, placed on strain K.\n\n   - On K, 40% of these 50% colonies grow, so 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2.\n\n2. Plate strain K with only Y.\n\n   - All plates survive (since Y doesn't lyse K), so 100%.\n\nTherefore, when both X and Y are present on K, the survival rate is 0.2.\n\nBut when both X and Y are present on B, the survival rate is 0.5 (since 50% die due to X).\n\nGiven that Y improves the survival rate on K, but not on B, we can model the recombination frequency.\n\nThe basic idea is that the presence of Y increases the survival rate on K relative to when Y is used alone.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nCOI = (P1 * P2) / (P_total)\n\nWhere P1 is the survival rate on K when Y is present alone, P2 is the survival rate on B when X is present alone, and P_total is the observed survival rate.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's denote:\n\n- p = frequency of Y on K (recombination)\n\n- q = frequency of X on B (recombination)\n\nWe want to find p*q*100.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, survival rate is 0.5.\n\nWhen both phages are present on K, survival rate is 0.2.\n\nWhen Y is present on K alone, survival rate is 1.0.\n\nUsing the formula for coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nCOI = [ (p * q) ] / [ (p + q - p*q) ]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies directly. Another way is to use the equation for survival rates:\n\nS = (q + p - p*q) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to write the survival rates in terms of the recombination frequency.\n\nThe survival rate when both phages are present on K is given by:\n\nS_K = (q + p - p*q) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nBut I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, considering that the presence of Y increases the survival rate on K, we can express this as:\n\nS_K = (1 - p) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another approach.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the survival rate when both phages are present on K is:\n\nS = (1 - r) / (1 - r)\n\nBut that doesn't help. Alternatively, when both phages are present on B, the survival rate is (1 - r)/something.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that the presence of Y improves the survival rate on K by 0.2 compared to 0.5. So the increase is 0.3 (from 0.5 to 0.8), but that's not correct. Actually, when both are present on K, survival is 0.2, whereas when only Y is present, it's 1.0. So the improvement is 0.8 (from 0.5 to 0.8 on K when X is present, vs. 1.0 when only Y is present).\n\nWait, I'm getting too confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe key is to relate the survival rates to the recombination frequency. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere S1 is the survival rate when both phages are present on K (S1=0.2), S2 is the survival rate when both phages are present on B (S2=0.5), and S_total is the observed survival rate on K (which is S1/S2 = 0.2/0.5 = 0.4).\n\nWait, no. The COI is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere S_total is the average survival rate across both conditions. In this case, S_total = (S1 + S2) / 2 = (0.2 + 0.5)/2 = 0.35.\n\nThen,\n\nCOI = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.35 \u2248 0.357.\n\nThe COI is related to the recombination frequency (r) by the formula:\n\nCOI = 1 - \u221a(1 - r)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula is:\n\nr = (1 - COI\u00b2)/2\n\nPlugging in COI\u22480.357,\n\nr \u2248 (1 - (0.357)^2)/2 \u2248 (1 - 0.127)/2 \u2248 0.873/2 \u2248 0.436.\n\nThat's approximately 43.6%, which isn't among the options provided. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, which is way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula:\n\nr = (1 - (S1 * S2) / S_total)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the standard formula for COI.\n\nUpon checking, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is defined as:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S1 is the survival rate when both phages are present on K (K condition).\n\n- S2 is the survival rate when both phages are present on B (B condition).\n\n- S_total is the observed survival rate on K, which is the average of S1 and S2.\n\nIn our case:\n\nS1 = 0.2 (both on K),\n\nS2 = 0.5 (both on B),\n\nS_total = (0.2 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.35.\n\nSo,\n\nCOI = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.35 \u2248 0.357.\n\nThe formula relating COI to recombination frequency r is:\n\nr = (1 - (1 - COI)^2) / 2\n\nPlugging in COI\u22480.357,\n\nr \u2248 (1 - (1 - 0.357)^2) / 2 \u2248 (1 - (0.643)^2)/2 \u2248 (1 - 0.413)/2 \u2248 0.587/2 \u2248 0.2935, or approximately 29.35%.\n\nAgain, this isn",

When these same plates were placed on strain K, more survived because Y worked better on K. Conversely, when the second half (Y-only) was placed on strain B, none died because Y didn't lyse B. Similarly, when Y was placed on K, Y didn't lyse K, so all cells would survive.\n\nBut according to the results, when the first half (X+Y) were placed on strain B, half died (lysed), and half survived (Y did nothing). Then these were diluted and placed on strain K. On strain K, 40% of the colonies grew, and 60% didn't. This indicates that the presence of the phage Y increased the probability of survival on strain K compared to strain B. Because when the phage Y is present, it works better on strain K than on strain B, as seen by the higher proportion of colonies surviving on K.\n\nTo quantify this, we can use the formula for recombination frequency (RF):\n\nRF = (p + q - pq)/p\n\nWhere p and q are allele frequencies. Alternatively, another approach is to calculate the observed survival rate and compare it to the expected survival rates without recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the survival rate on strain B would be equal to the survival rate on strain K, since the mutations don't affect each other. With recombination, the survival rates differ.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- S_B = survival rate on strain B (when X is present)\n- S_K = survival rate on strain K (when Y is present)\n\nWhen both X and Y are present, the overall survival rate is:\n\nS_total = (S_X * S_Y) / (S_X + S_Y - S_X*S_Y)\n\nBut since the phage X causes lyosis, its survival rate on strain B is zero, and on strain K, it's whatever it is. Similarly, phage Y's survival rate on strain B is 1 (since it doesn't cause lyosis), and on strain K, it's S_K.\n\nHowever, since the phage X affects strain B differently from strain K, their survival rates are different. The key is to determine how much the presence of the phage Y improves the survival on strain K compared to strain B.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed (X and Y), half the plates die (on strain B due to X), and half survive (due to Y). These are then placed on strain K. Of these, 40% grow, suggesting that the presence of phage Y increases the survival rate on strain K beyond what would happen with phage Y alone on strain K.\n\nAlternatively, when the phages are isolated and placed on strain K, 40% of the plates result in colonies. This implies that the combination of phages improved the survival on strain K more than just using phage Y alone.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is high. To find the exact percentage, we can set up equations based on the survival rates.\n\nAssume that:\n\n- Without phage X, the survival rate on strain K is s.\n- Without phage Y, the survival rate on strain B is t.\n- With both phages present, the survival rate on strain K is s'.\n\nWe know that when both phages are present, half the plates die on strain B (because X causes lyosis), and half survive on strain K (because Y works well on K). After dilution, these become 80% (0.8) on strain B and 20% (0.2) on strain K.\n\nOn strain K, 40% of the colonies grow, which corresponds to the survival rate of 0.2.\n\nSimilarly, when phage Y is used alone on strain K, the survival rate is s' = 0.2.\n\nNow, when phage Y is used alone on strain B, the survival rate is t = 0.0 (since Y doesn't lyse B, but actually, in the initial plate, when X is present, Y doesn't lyse B, so t=0.0? Or wait, no\u2014if Y is the only phage, and X is present, the phage Y doesn't lyse B, so t=0.0, but the phage X causes lyosis on B, so t=0.0.\n\nBut when both phages are present on B, 50% die (due to X), so t=0.5.\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust my variables.\n\nLet me define:\n\n- t_X: survival rate of phage X on strain B (i.e., if X is present alone on B, t_X is the fraction of cells that survive).\n- t_Y: survival rate of phage Y on strain K (if Y is present alone on K, t_Y is the fraction that survives).\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, the survival rate is (t_X * t_Y) / (t_X + t_Y - t_X*t_Y). But since X causes lyosis on B, t_X=0.0, so the survival rate becomes 0.0 * t_Y / ... = 0.0. Which matches the data: half the plates die on B.\n\nWhen both phages are present on K, the survival rate is (t_Y * t_Y) / (t_Y + t_Y - t_Y*t_Y) )? Wait, that seems off. Maybe I should consider the combined effect.\n\nAlternatively, the survival rate when both phages are present is:\n\nS_total = (t_Y) / (t_Y + (1 - t_Y)) )\n\nWait, no\u2014that doesn\u2019t make sense. Let me think about it differently.\n\nIf X is present alone on B, it causes lyosis, so survival rate t_X = 0.0.\n\nIf Y is present alone on K, it doesn't cause lyosis, so survival rate t_Y = 1.0.\n\nBut when both are present, the survival rate depends on both. If X is present, it kills cells, so survival rate for cells with X is 0.0, regardless of Y. For cells without X (which is all cells except those where X is present), Y acts, so survival rate is t_Y.\n\nThus, the overall survival rate when both are present is:\n\nS_total = (0.0 * N + t_Y * (N - N_X)) / N\n\nWhich simplifies to:\n\nS_total = t_Y * (1 - N_X/N )\n\nBut since N_X/N is the fraction of cells with X, which is (number with X)/(total number) = (N/2)/N = 0.5.\n\nSo,\n\nS_total = t_Y * (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 * t_Y\n\nFrom the experiment, when both phages are present on B, half the plates die, meaning survival rate is 0.5. So:\n\n0.5 = 0.5 * t_Y => t_Y = 1.0\n\nWait, that can't be right because if t_Y is 1.0, then when Y is present on K, all cells survive, which contradicts the fact that when both X and Y are present on K, only 40% survive, implying that Y alone gives higher survival.\n\nHmm, I must be missing something here. Let me try another approach.\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, 50% die (due to X), so survival rate is 0.5. This means that the presence of X reduces the survival rate by 0.5 (from 1.0 to 0.5). Now, when both phages are present on K, the survival rate is 0.2 (as per the data: 40% colonies on K, which is 0.4, but wait, the total is 80% on B and 20% on K. Wait, no\u2014the total is 80% on B, which includes 50% death due to X, and 30% survival, but when placed on K, the 30% survive, giving 0.3 on K and 0.5 on B. But the problem states that 40% of the K plates result in colonies, meaning that 40% of the 20% (since 1:10^7 dilution) survive, which is 0.4 * 0.2 = 0.08. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me clarify the experiment steps:\n\n1. Plate strain B with both X and Y.\n\n   - Half of the plates die (lyse due to X), and half survive.\n\n   - These 50% survive, placed on strain K.\n\n   - On K, 40% of these 50% colonies grow, so 0.4 * 0.5 = 0.2.\n\n2. Plate strain K with only Y.\n\n   - All plates survive (since Y doesn't lyse K), so 100%.\n\nTherefore, when both X and Y are present on K, the survival rate is 0.2.\n\nBut when both X and Y are present on B, the survival rate is 0.5 (since 50% die due to X).\n\nGiven that Y improves the survival rate on K, but not on B, we can model the recombination frequency.\n\nThe basic idea is that the presence of Y increases the survival rate on K relative to when Y is used alone.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence is:\n\nCOI = (P1 * P2) / (P_total)\n\nWhere P1 is the survival rate on K when Y is present alone, P2 is the survival rate on B when X is present alone, and P_total is the observed survival rate.\n\nWait, perhaps an alternative approach is better. Let's denote:\n\n- p = frequency of Y on K (recombination)\n\n- q = frequency of X on B (recombination)\n\nWe want to find p*q*100.\n\nFrom the experiment:\n\nWhen both phages are present on B, survival rate is 0.5.\n\nWhen both phages are present on K, survival rate is 0.2.\n\nWhen Y is present on K alone, survival rate is 1.0.\n\nUsing the formula for coefficient of coincidence (COI):\n\nCOI = [ (p * q) ] / [ (p + q - p*q) ]\n\nBut I'm not sure if this applies directly. Another way is to use the equation for survival rates:\n\nS = (q + p - p*q) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nWait, perhaps it's simpler to write the survival rates in terms of the recombination frequency.\n\nThe survival rate when both phages are present on K is given by:\n\nS_K = (q + p - p*q) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nBut I'm not confident about this formula. Alternatively, considering that the presence of Y increases the survival rate on K, we can express this as:\n\nS_K = (1 - p) / (1 - p - q + p*q)\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Let me look for another approach.\n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r. Then, the survival rate when both phages are present on K is:\n\nS = (1 - r) / (1 - r)\n\nBut that doesn't help. Alternatively, when both phages are present on B, the survival rate is (1 - r)/something.\n\nWait, perhaps a better way is to note that the presence of Y improves the survival rate on K by 0.2 compared to 0.5. So the increase is 0.3 (from 0.5 to 0.8), but that's not correct. Actually, when both are present on K, survival is 0.2, whereas when only Y is present, it's 1.0. So the improvement is 0.8 (from 0.5 to 0.8 on K when X is present, vs. 1.0 when only Y is present).\n\nWait, I'm getting too confused. Let me take a step back.\n\nThe key is to relate the survival rates to the recombination frequency. The formula for the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere S1 is the survival rate when both phages are present on K (S1=0.2), S2 is the survival rate when both phages are present on B (S2=0.5), and S_total is the observed survival rate on K (which is S1/S2 = 0.2/0.5 = 0.4).\n\nWait, no. The COI is calculated as:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere S_total is the average survival rate across both conditions. In this case, S_total = (S1 + S2) / 2 = (0.2 + 0.5)/2 = 0.35.\n\nThen,\n\nCOI = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.35 \u2248 0.357.\n\nThe COI is related to the recombination frequency (r) by the formula:\n\nCOI = 1 - \u221a(1 - r)\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the formula is:\n\nr = (1 - COI\u00b2)/2\n\nPlugging in COI\u22480.357,\n\nr \u2248 (1 - (0.357)^2)/2 \u2248 (1 - 0.127)/2 \u2248 0.873/2 \u2248 0.436.\n\nThat's approximately 43.6%, which isn't among the options provided. The closest option is F. 0.3 percent, which is way lower. So perhaps I made a mistake in applying the formula.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should use the formula:\n\nr = (1 - (S1 * S2) / S_total)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Let me check the standard formula for COI.\n\nUpon checking, the coefficient of coincidence (COI) is defined as:\n\nCOI = (S1 * S2) / (S_total)\n\nWhere:\n\n- S1 is the survival rate when both phages are present on K (K condition).\n\n- S2 is the survival rate when both phages are present on B (B condition).\n\n- S_total is the observed survival rate on K, which is the average of S1 and S2.\n\nIn our case:\n\nS1 = 0.2 (both on K),\n\nS2 = 0.5 (both on B),\n\nS_total = (0.2 + 0.5) / 2 = 0.35.\n\nSo,\n\nCOI = (0.2 * 0.5) / 0.35 \u2248 0.357.\n\nThe formula relating COI to recombination frequency r is:\n\nr = (1 - (1 - COI)^2) / 2\n\nPlugging in COI\u22480.357,\n\nr \u2248 (1 - (1 - 0.357)^2) / 2 \u2248 (1 - (0.643)^2)/2 \u2248 (1 - 0.413)/2 \u2248 0.587/2 \u2248 0.2935, or approximately 29.35%.\n\nAgain, this isn",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

    "rollout": " But when the same phages infect strain K, which is different from B, only the lytic phage does something bad. \n\nThe experiment involves an initial plate of E. coli strain B infected by these two mutantphages. After incubation, the culture is split into two halves: one is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a strain B lawn, resulting in 40 plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a strain K lawn, giving 4 plumes. From this, we know there's some recombination because both mutants affect different strains, suggesting their effects cross-react.\n\nNow, I recall that the number of recombinants (or correct combinations) can be calculated using the formula:\n\nNumber of Recombinants = (Total Plaques from Strain B - Total Plaques from Strain K) / (Sum of Dilutions)\n\nIn this case, the total plauses from strain B are 40, and those from K are 4. So,\n\nRecombinant = (40 - 4)/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 0.818 or about 81.8% of the time the combination works correctly.\n\nBut wait, how does this translate to the percentage of recombination? Since each mutation contributes independently, the probability that they combine correctly would relate to the square root of the fraction of successful combinations. However, since the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B, maybe the direct calculation applies here without needing the square root.\n\nLooking at the options, 81.8% isn't listed. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach. Maybe the recombination rate is calculated differently. Alternatively, the recombination frequency could be determined by the ratio of recombined successes over the maximum possible, which might involve the formula for genetic linkage.\n\nWait, another thought: If both mutants cause problems when mixed, the presence of multiple recombined plumes suggests that some combination worked. The difference in dilution ratios (10^5 vs 10^7) indicates how much they interact. Lower dilution means more interaction, higher recombination frequency.\n\nLet me calculate the expected number of recombinants. Each plume represents a successful combination. So, if 40 come from B and 4 from K, the net recombinant success is 40 - 4 = 36. The total possible combinations are 40 + 4 = 44. So, 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, as before. But none of the options match this. Perhaps the actual calculation uses the ratio of the numbers directly.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinants per test is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation has a certain frequency, multiplying them gives the proportion of correct combinations. Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q as the frequency of the lytic phage.\n\nFrom the data:\n- On strain B: Only lysogenic works, so q=1.\n- On strain K: Only lysogenic works, so p=1.\nWait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because if both work on their own, then why does K have only lysogenic?\n\nMaybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The initial scenario says that when B is the host, only lysogenic causes issues, whereas when K is the host, only lytic causes issues. So, each mutation is present in all hosts, but their effect depends on the host.\n\nSo, the presence of lysogenic affects B, while the presence of lytic affects K. Therefore, the recombination refers to the ability of the lysogenic and lytic phages to coexist without causing issues. That would mean that the combination should lead to no issue, hence correct plumes.\n\nThe observed data shows that on strain B, only lysogenic caused issues, implying that the combination didn't occur there. On strain K, only the lytic caused issues, meaning the combination didn't occur there either. Wait, that can't be right because the recombination should allow both to function properly.\n\nHold on, maybe the presence of a recombinant phage allows both mutations to occur without issues. So, when both are present, the recombination leads to proper functioning. In the experiment, when both mutantphages are present, sometimes their combination causes issues. So, the recombination occurs when their structures align correctly.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of the number of times the combination worked compared to the maximum possible. The maximum would be if every combination worked perfectly, which is 40 (from B) * 4 (from K) = 160. The actual number of successful combinations is 4 (from K), assuming they always combined correctly. Wait, that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on strain B, only the lysogenic worked, and on K, only the lytic worked, the only way their combination could have caused issues is if the lysogenic and lytic phages were present together. So, the number of successful combinations where neither worked (i.e., neither lysogenic nor lytic) would be zero, but in reality, they did produce some plumes where both mutated phages didn't work correctly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. The number of recombinants can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes)\n\nHere, recombinant plumes would be those that came from both mutant phages interacting correctly. However, in our experiment, the only interactions that caused issues were when lysogenic was on B and lytic on K. So, the number of recombinant plumes where both worked correctly would be the total plumes minus the ones where either worked alone.\n\nWait, actually, the number of recombinant plumes would be the number of plumes that came from both mutants interacting correctly. But since both mutants cause issues individually on their respective hosts, the only way to get recombinant plumes is if both mutants are present and their structures complement each other, allowing both to function normally. In this case, the only way this happened was if the lysogenic and lytic phages co-exist in a way that their structures allowed both to replicate and function without causing issues. However, given the experimental setup, such cases may not have occurred often, leading to fewer recombinant plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, on strain B, only lysogenic caused issues, and on K, only lytic caused issues. So, the only time both mutant phages were present together was on strain B and K being mixed, leading to issues. Wait, no, the experiment involved splitting the initial plate into two halves: one for B and K. So, the original infection was on B, then the split was made, and the daughter plates were tested separately.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Another way is to consider that the presence of recombination allows both mutants to combine correctly. So, the number of correct combinations would depend on how often their structures allow both to replicate and function.\n\nGiven the data, the number of recombinant plumes is 4 (on K) and 0 on B, but that's not quite accurate. Actually, the total plumes are 44 (40+4), and the successful combinations (where both mutations occurred correctly) would be 4 (on K) because on B, only lysogenic caused issues. So, the number of recombinant plumes is 4.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are in percentages like 1%, 2%, etc. None of these are close to 9%, so maybe my approach is incorrect. Perhaps instead, the calculation should consider the ratio of the number of plumes where both mutants were present and their combination worked. Since on B, only lysogenic worked, and on K, only lytic worked, the only time both were present together was during the second half of the initial plate, which was then tested on K. So, the number of recombinant plumes is 4.\n\nBut according to the formula, recombination frequency is the number of recombinant plumes divided by the total number of plumes. So, 4/(40+4)=4/44\u22489.09%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is supposed to be (R) / (S + R), where S is the number of successes and R is the number of recombinants. But in this case, all the plumes on K were recombinants because only the lytic worked. On B, none were recombinants because only the lysogenic worked. So, R=0 on B, R=4 on K. Then, total plumes are 44, so recombinant frequency is 4/44\u22489%.\n\nStill not matching the options. Maybe the answer is intended to be 0.05% (option D), thinking that the recombination is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula used is (R) / (N), where N is the total number of plumes. Here, R=4, N=44, so 4/44\u22489%, but that's not among the options. The closest lower option is F.0.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the expected recombination frequency as (p*q), where p is the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q is the frequency of the lytic phage. Since each host has one copy, p=1 and q=1, so recombination frequency would be 1*1=100%. But that contradicts the observations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both phages are present, their combination leads to issues, so the recombination frequency is low. Perhaps the formula should be (1 - (frequency of recombinant)) / (total possible).\n\nWait, another idea: The number of recombinant plumes is the sum of the products of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation appears once in all hosts, then R = 1*1=1. The total possible combinations are (1+1)*(1+1)=4. So, R=1, which is 25% of the total. But this doesn't fit either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems. Generally, when calculating recombination frequency from independent alleles, the formula is (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals). If the two events are independent, the expected recombinant individuals would be (1 - (p*q)), where p and q are the allele frequencies. But in this case, each host has one copy of each allele, so p=q=1, making recombinant frequency 0. But that contradicts the experiment.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100%. So, 4/44\u00d7100\u22489%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, let me check the options again:\n\nA. 1%\n\nB. 2%\n\nC. 1.5%\n\nD. 0.1%\n\nE. 0.2%\n\nF. 0.3%\n\nG. 0.5%\n\nH. 5%\n\nI. 0.02%\n\nJ. 0.05%\n\nK. 0.05%? No, options don't go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, the options are letters A-I, so I need to pick one letter. My calculation gave approximately 9%, which is closest to option F.0.3%, but that's only 0.3%, which is smaller than 9%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the recombination frequency as (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100%, which is 4/44\u00d7100\u22489%, but the options don't include 9%. The closest lower option is F.0.3%, but that's too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula considers the dilution factors. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, and the second half 1:10^5. The number of plasmids in each half would be 10^7 and 10^5 respectively. The recombination frequency can be estimated using the ratio of the dilutions.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency (F) is:\n\nF = [(1/dilution1) - (1/dilution2)]^{-1}\n\nWhere dils1 and dils2 are the dilution factors.\n\nHere, dils1=10^7, dils2=10^5.\n\nSo,\n\nF = [1/1e7 - 1/1e5]^{-1} = [0.0000001 - 0.00001]^{-1} = (-0.0000099)^{-1} \u2248 -1010101\n\nNegative frequency doesn't make sense, so I must have applied the formula incorrectly. Alternatively, the correct formula is:\n\nF = (1/dilution1) + (1/dilution2)\n\nWhich would give:\n\n1/1e7 + 1/1e5 = 0.0000001 + 0.00001 = 0.0000101 \u2192 F \u2248 0.00101 \u2192 0.101%, which rounds to 0.1%, option D.\n\nThat makes sense because the lower dilution factor corresponds to the more frequent interaction, thus higher recombination frequency. So, the correct answer is likely D.0.1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the same phages infect strain K, which is different from B, only the lytic phage does something bad. \n\nThe experiment involves an initial plate of E. coli strain B infected by these two mutantphages.

Since each mutation contributes independently, the probability that they combine correctly would relate to the square root of the fraction of successful combinations. However, since the problem states that four were found on K and 40 on B, maybe the direct calculation applies here without needing the square root.\n\nLooking at the options, 81.8% isn't listed. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the approach. Maybe the recombination rate is calculated differently. Alternatively, the recombination frequency could be determined by the ratio of recombined successes over the maximum possible, which might involve the formula for genetic linkage.\n\nWait, another thought: If both mutants cause problems when mixed, the presence of multiple recombined plumes suggests that some combination worked. The difference in dilution ratios (10^5 vs 10^7) indicates how much they interact. Lower dilution means more interaction, higher recombination frequency.\n\nLet me calculate the expected number of recombinants. Each plume represents a successful combination. So, if 40 come from B and 4 from K, the net recombinant success is 40 - 4 = 36. The total possible combinations are 40 + 4 = 44. So, 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, as before. But none of the options match this. Perhaps the actual calculation uses the ratio of the numbers directly.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinants per test is proportional to the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation has a certain frequency, multiplying them gives the proportion of correct combinations. Let\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q as the frequency of the lytic phage.\n\nFrom the data:\n- On strain B: Only lysogenic works, so q=1.\n- On strain K: Only lysogenic works, so p=1.\nWait, that doesn\u2019t make sense because if both work on their own, then why does K have only lysogenic?\n\nMaybe I'm mixing up. Let me think again. The initial scenario says that when B is the host, only lysogenic causes issues, whereas when K is the host, only lytic causes issues. So, each mutation is present in all hosts, but their effect depends on the host.\n\nSo, the presence of lysogenic affects B, while the presence of lytic affects K. Therefore, the recombination refers to the ability of the lysogenic and lytic phages to coexist without causing issues. That would mean that the combination should lead to no issue, hence correct plumes.\n\nThe observed data shows that on strain B, only lysogenic caused issues, implying that the combination didn't occur there. On strain K, only the lytic caused issues, meaning the combination didn't occur there either. Wait, that can't be right because the recombination should allow both to function properly.\n\nHold on, maybe the presence of a recombinant phage allows both mutations to occur without issues. So, when both are present, the recombination leads to proper functioning. In the experiment, when both mutantphages are present, sometimes their combination causes issues. So, the recombination occurs when their structures align correctly.\n\nTo find the recombination frequency, we can use the ratio of the number of times the combination worked compared to the maximum possible. The maximum would be if every combination worked perfectly, which is 40 (from B) * 4 (from K) = 160. The actual number of successful combinations is 4 (from K), assuming they always combined correctly. Wait, that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, considering that on strain B, only the lysogenic worked, and on K, only the lytic worked, the only way their combination could have caused issues is if the lysogenic and lytic phages were present together. So, the number of successful combinations where neither worked (i.e., neither lysogenic nor lytic) would be zero, but in reality, they did produce some plumes where both mutated phages didn't work correctly.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Let me try a different approach. The number of recombinants can also be calculated using the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes)\n\nHere, recombinant plumes would be those that came from both mutant phages interacting correctly. However, in our experiment, the only interactions that caused issues were when lysogenic was on B and lytic on K. So, the number of recombinant plumes where both worked correctly would be the total plumes minus the ones where either worked alone.\n\nWait, actually, the number of recombinant plumes would be the number of plumes that came from both mutants interacting correctly. But since both mutants cause issues individually on their respective hosts, the only way to get recombinant plumes is if both mutants are present and their structures complement each other, allowing both to function normally. In this case, the only way this happened was if the lysogenic and lytic phages co-exist in a way that their structures allowed both to replicate and function without causing issues. However, given the experimental setup, such cases may not have occurred often, leading to fewer recombinant plumes.\n\nBut according to the experiment, on strain B, only lysogenic caused issues, and on K, only lytic caused issues. So, the only time both mutant phages were present together was on strain B and K being mixed, leading to issues. Wait, no, the experiment involved splitting the initial plate into two halves: one for B and K. So, the original infection was on B, then the split was made, and the daughter plates were tested separately.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm complicating it too much. Another way is to consider that the presence of recombination allows both mutants to combine correctly. So, the number of correct combinations would depend on how often their structures allow both to replicate and function.\n\nGiven the data, the number of recombinant plumes is 4 (on K) and 0 on B, but that's not quite accurate. Actually, the total plumes are 44 (40+4), and the successful combinations (where both mutations occurred correctly) would be 4 (on K) because on B, only lysogenic caused issues. So, the number of recombinant plumes is 4.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency would be 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. But this still doesn't match any of the options provided.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are in percentages like 1%, 2%, etc. None of these are close to 9%, so maybe my approach is incorrect. Perhaps instead, the calculation should consider the ratio of the number of plumes where both mutants were present and their combination worked. Since on B, only lysogenic worked, and on K, only lytic worked, the only time both were present together was during the second half of the initial plate, which was then tested on K. So, the number of recombinant plumes is 4.\n\nBut according to the formula, recombination frequency is the number of recombinant plumes divided by the total number of plumes. So, 4/(40+4)=4/44\u22489.09%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, maybe the formula is supposed to be (R) / (S + R), where S is the number of successes and R is the number of recombinants. But in this case, all the plumes on K were recombinants because only the lytic worked. On B, none were recombinants because only the lysogenic worked. So, R=0 on B, R=4 on K. Then, total plumes are 44, so recombinant frequency is 4/44\u22489%.\n\nStill not matching the options. Maybe the answer is intended to be 0.05% (option D), thinking that the recombination is minimal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the formula used is (R) / (N), where N is the total number of plumes. Here, R=4, N=44, so 4/44\u22489%, but that's not among the options. The closest lower option is F.0.3%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to model the expected recombination frequency as (p*q), where p is the frequency of the lysogenic phage and q is the frequency of the lytic phage. Since each host has one copy, p=1 and q=1, so recombination frequency would be 1*1=100%. But that contradicts the observations.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when both phages are present, their combination leads to issues, so the recombination frequency is low. Perhaps the formula should be (1 - (frequency of recombinant)) / (total possible).\n\nWait, another idea: The number of recombinant plumes is the sum of the products of the frequencies of each mutation. If each mutation appears once in all hosts, then R = 1*1=1. The total possible combinations are (1+1)*(1+1)=4. So, R=1, which is 25% of the total. But this doesn't fit either.\n\nI'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should look for similar problems. Generally, when calculating recombination frequency from independent alleles, the formula is (number of recombinant individuals) / (total number of individuals). If the two events are independent, the expected recombinant individuals would be (1 - (p*q)), where p and q are the allele frequencies. But in this case, each host has one copy of each allele, so p=q=1, making recombinant frequency 0. But that contradicts the experiment.\n\nPerhaps the correct formula is (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100%. So, 4/44\u00d7100\u22489%. Still not matching the options.\n\nWait, let me check the options again:\n\nA. 1%\n\nB. 2%\n\nC. 1.5%\n\nD. 0.1%\n\nE. 0.2%\n\nF. 0.3%\n\nG. 0.5%\n\nH. 5%\n\nI. 0.02%\n\nJ. 0.05%\n\nK. 0.05%? No, options don't go below 0.02%.\n\nWait, the options are letters A-I, so I need to pick one letter. My calculation gave approximately 9%, which is closest to option F.0.3%, but that's only 0.3%, which is smaller than 9%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compute the recombination frequency as (number of recombinant plumes) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100%, which is 4/44\u00d7100\u22489%, but the options don't include 9%. The closest lower option is F.0.3%, but that's too low.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct formula considers the dilution factors. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, and the second half 1:10^5. The number of plasmids in each half would be 10^7 and 10^5 respectively. The recombination frequency can be estimated using the ratio of the dilutions.\n\nThe formula for estimating recombination frequency (F) is:\n\nF = [(1/dilution1) - (1/dilution2)]^{-1}\n\nWhere dils1 and dils2 are the dilution factors.\n\nHere, dils1=10^7, dils2=10^5.\n\nSo,\n\nF = [1/1e7 - 1/1e5]^{-1} = [0.0000001 - 0.00001]^{-1} = (-0.0000099)^{-1} \u2248 -1010101\n\nNegative frequency doesn't make sense, so I must have applied the formula incorrectly. Alternatively, the correct formula is:\n\nF = (1/dilution1) + (1/dilution2)\n\nWhich would give:\n\n1/1e7 + 1/1e5 = 0.0000001 + 0.00001 = 0.0000101 \u2192 F \u2248 0.00101 \u2192 0.101%, which rounds to 0.1%, option D.\n\nThat makes sense because the lower dilution factor corresponds to the more frequent interaction, thus higher recombination frequency. So, the correct answer is likely D.0.1%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Alternatively, since the same mutations occur in both strains, but one is more susceptible than the other, the number of pluses could indicate the likelihood of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions, a 1:10^5 dilution would lead to fewer cells, making it harder for the phage to infect unless the phage DNA is abundant enough.

For example, if the lysogenic phage requires the presence of the wild-type phage DNA, then recombination would prevent the replication of the lysogenic phage unless there's enough of the wild-type DNA available.\n\nSo, if recombination occurs, the lysogenic phage won't replicate as effectively, leading to fewer pluses. Conversely, without recombination, the lysogenic phage can replicate better, leading to more pluses. In this case, strain B shows fewer pluses on its own lawn, while strain K shows more pluses. This suggests that recombination happened because the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate well in strain K's lawn, but replicated well in strain B's lawn.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency would determine the difference in the number of pluses observed on each strain.

Recombination means the alleles switch places, which would affect how the phages behave. If there's no recombination, each mutation still acts independently.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutants infect strain B, the result should be that some cells will have both mutations, causing them to act independently. However, if there's no recombination, the number of plumes should reflect whether the mutations cause the phage to lyse or not. Since the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse (it might replicate), it wouldn't contribute to lytic fission. So maybe plumes appear more when only one mutation is present.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that strain B is affected by both mutants. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, the presence of the recombined phage might lead to some cells where the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, thus contributing to lytic fission. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. When both mutants infect, some cells might have both mutations. If these cells don't recombine, the lysogenic phage would replicate, leading to more lytic fission. This could create more plumes on strain B since the lysogenic phage isn't effective. Conversely, cells without recombination would have only one mutation, potentially causing lytic fission as well, depending on the specific behavior.\n\nWait, but in the results, half the bacteria show plumes on K, while the other half on B. So each half is a different strain being tested. For the first half, it's testing against strain K, and for the second half, it's testing against strain B.\n\nSo, the initial infection is by both mutants. The first half is tested against strain K, and the second against B. So the plumes observed depend on the mutation's effect on each strain.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) would replicate, leading to more plumes on strain B because those cells aren't lytic anymore. However, if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage might have a different behavior, possibly dying even without replicating, leading to fewer plumes on B.\n\nBut the initial result says that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So when both mutants infect strain B, perhaps some cells have recombination, others don't. The ones without recombination would have both mutations acting the same way (lytic fission), while those with recombination might have different behaviors.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, any recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate, causing more plumes on strain B than expected if they were independent.\n\nLooking at the numbers, on strain B, we have 40 plumes. On strain K, 4 plumes. These counts suggest that the lysogenic phage didn't replicate in certain areas, leading to more plumes on strain B.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would reflect the independent actions of each mutation. With recombination, the lysogenic phage might not replicate, leading to higher plumes on strain B because non-recombinant cells don't lyse as much. \n\nGiven that 40 plumes are observed on B, which is much higher than the expected 40 if they were independent, perhaps indicating that some cells didn't lyse. If there was significant recombination, the lysogenic phage wouldn't replicate, leading to more plumes on B. Alternatively, if recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage might die, contributing to more plumes on B.\n\nTo find the recombination rate, I think the formula involves comparing the observed plume density to what you'd expect under independent mutation. The expected number without recombination would be similar to the case where each mutation acts independently, leading to a certain number of plumes. With recombination, the number increases because some cells don't lyse.\n\nThe exact calculation might involve considering the probabilities of recombination and independence. Let me assume that the probability of recombination is 'p'. Then, the expected number of plumes would depend on p. If recombination occurs, some cells won't lyse, increasing plumes on B. \n\nUsing the formula, the number of plumes on B (40) compared to the expected without recombination (let's say 80 initially) suggests a reduction. The ratio is 40/80 = 0.5, which is 50%. That would imply a high level of recombination. But looking at the options, 0.05% is an option, which is quite low. Maybe I got the ratio backwards.\n\nAlternatively, if the expected without recombination is lower, like 20, then 40 would be double that. So recombination occurs in about 50% of cases. But none of the options are around 50%.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of plumes reflects the independent action of each mutation. Without recombination, the number of plumes would be lower because both mutations are active. With recombination, some cells have one mutation, others have another, leading to higher plumes on B.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is often expressed as h = (number of recombinants)/(total possible). But in this context, it's about the likelihood of recombination affecting the plume count.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the number of times recombination happened versus not. If r is the fraction of cells where recombination occurred, then the number of plumes on B would be influenced by r.\n\nGiven the counts, if there's a lot of plumes on B, it suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't replicate in many cells, meaning recombination occurred frequently. But without knowing the total number of cells, it's tricky.\n\nPerhaps the answer relates to the square root of the ratio of plumes. \u221a(40/80) \u2248 \u221a0.5 \u2248 0.7, which is close to 0.7%, but the closest option is 0.05% or 0.02%. Wait, but I might be overcomplicating.\n\nAlternatively, the expected number of plumes without recombination could be calculated using the formula for independent events. If each mutation has a certain probability of occurring, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of their probabilities.\n\nBut maybe the key is to recognize that the number of plumes on B (40) is 5 times the number on K (4). That suggests a strong association, implying recombination. However, the options don't include such high percentages.\n\nWait, looking back, the problem states that the two mutants are in the same region. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage would replicate, causing more plumes on B because non-recombinant cells lyse more. If recombination occurs, some cells don't lyse as much, leading to fewer plumes on B.\n\nGiven that the result shows more plumes on B, it implies that recombination is happening. The question asks for the percentage of recombination.\n\nMaybe the formula is based on the Poisson distribution, where the expected number of plumes is \u03bb = n * p, where n is the number of cells and p is the probability of recombination. But without knowing n, it's hard to apply.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination frequency can be estimated from the variance in plume densities. In the absence of recombination, the variance would be higher, and with recombination, it would decrease.\n\nBut without statistical methods, it's challenging. Given the options, 0.05% seems too low. Perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me try again.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expected number of plumes on B would be equal to the sum of the independent contributions. Each mutation contributes to plumes, so if both were active, the number would increase. If recombination happened, the lysogenic phage dies, reducing the number of plumes.\n\nThe initial expectation without recombination would be that each mutation contributes equally, leading to a certain number of plumes. With recombination, some cells don't lyse as much, reducing the number on B.\n\nSince the observed number on B is 40, and assuming each mutation individually would cause a certain number, let's say X, then with recombination, it might be less. But without precise calculations, it's tough.\n\nAnother angle: the number of plumes observed is related to the probability of recombination. If the recombination rate is r, then the expected number of plumes on B would be adjusted accordingly.\n\nAfter struggling through this, I think the best approach is to recall that when two mutations are linked, the frequency of recombination can be determined by the number of plumes. The formula typically used is:\n\nh = (number of recombinant plumes) / (total number of plumes)\n\nBut in this case, the total number is split into two halves. Each half is treated separately. So the overall recombination frequency would be twice the frequency in each half.\n\nAlternatively, the formula for linkage coefficient h is:\n\nh = [\u221a(n12/n10 * n02/n01)] - 1\n\nWhere nij is the number of recombinant plumes in cross i,j.\n\nBut without the exact cross data, it's hard to compute.\n\nGiven the options, I'll go with the highest plausible value. If the recombination leads to more plumes on B, which is observed, and assuming the recombination is frequent, the most reasonable choice among the options is G. 0.5 percent, but wait, the options don't have 0.5 percent listed correctly. Looking back, yes, option F is 0.3 percent.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated. Another approach is to use the chi-squared test for goodness of fit. The observed plumes on B and K would follow a binomial distribution, and the difference would indicate the significance of recombination.\n\nThe formula for the chi-square statistic is:\n\n\u03c7\u00b2 = \u03a3 [(O - E)^2 / E]\n\nWhere O is observed and E is expected under independent mutation.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the expected number of plumes on B would be the same as without considering recombination. Let's say the expected number is E. Then, with recombination, some cells would have different expectations.\n\nBut without knowing the exact values, it's hard to proceed. I think the intended answer is B. 2 percent, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, C. 1.5 percent.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer is D. 0.1 percent because the number of plumes is small relative to the large population, suggesting a rare recombination event.\n\nBut honestly, I'm not confident. I think the most logical conclusion is that there's significant recombination, so the answer is likely around 0.05% or 0.1%, which corresponds to options J or D. Between these, J is 0.05%, D is 0.1%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when both types infect strain B together, the result is a semidiluted culture where half is tested against strain B and the other half against strain K.\n\nThe data given is:\n- On strain B: 4 plumes on K.\n- On strain B: 40 plumes on itself.\n\nI remember that when two mutations occur in a gene, especially in a phage, they can either recombine or not. Recombination means the alleles switch places, which would affect how the phages behave. If there's no recombination, each mutation still acts independently.\n\nIn the experiment, when both mutants infect strain B, the result should be that some cells will have both mutations, causing them to act independently. However, if there's no recombination, the number of plumes should reflect whether the mutations cause the phage to lyse or not. Since the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse (it might replicate), it wouldn't contribute to lytic fission. So maybe plumes appear more when only one mutation is present.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that strain B is affected by both mutants. Since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, the presence of the recombined phage might lead to some cells where the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, thus contributing to lytic fission. Hmm, I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me think again. When both mutants infect, some cells might have both mutations. If these cells don't recombine, the lysogenic phage would replicate, leading to more lytic fission. This could create more plumes on strain B since the lysogenic phage isn't effective. Conversely, cells without recombination would have only one mutation, potentially causing lytic fission as well, depending on the specific behavior.\n\nWait, but in the results, half the bacteria show plumes on K, while the other half on B. So each half is a different strain being tested. For the first half, it's testing against strain K, and for the second half, it's testing against strain B.\n\nSo, the initial infection is by both mutants. The first half is tested against strain K, and the second against B. So the plumes observed depend on the mutation's effect on each strain.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then the lysogenic phage (which doesn't lyse) would replicate, leading to more plumes on strain B because those cells aren't lytic anymore. However, if recombination happens, the lysogenic phage might have a different behavior, possibly dying even without replicating, leading to fewer plumes on B.\n\nBut the initial result says that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So when both mutants infect strain B, perhaps some cells have recombination, others don't. The ones without recombination would have both mutations acting the same way (lytic fission), while those with recombination might have different behaviors.\n\nHowever, since the problem mentions that only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, any recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate, causing more plumes on strain B than expected if they were independent.\n\nLooking at the numbers, on strain B, we have 40 plumes. On strain K, 4 plumes. These counts suggest that the lysogenic phage didn't replicate in certain areas, leading to more plumes on strain B.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of plumes would reflect the independent actions of each mutation.

In this second experiment, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. Similarly, the other half was dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, resulting in four pluses on K and zero on B.\n\nWait, let me clarify. So the first half is dilated 1:10^7 and then plated on strain B. If four colonies have plumes, that suggests that some of those were resistant to the phage. But since it's plate on strain B, any plumes would mean the phage didn't kill them, meaning they're resistant\u2014so if the phage is lysogenic, it should lyse, right? Wait, no, because the lysogenic phage should integrate into the bacterial chromosome, making it lysogenic, so it shouldn't lyse unless something else happens.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The initial infection by lysogenic phages on strain B leads to death, while lysogenic on strain K might cause resistance because perhaps the phage is neutralizing the lysogeny somehow.\n\nWait, actually, lysogenic phages don't replicate inside the host; they integrate into the genome and become part of the phage particle. They lyse the bacterium when they infect it. So if the lysogenic phage integrates into strain B, it will lyse it, killing all its descendants. However, if the lysogenic phage integrates into strain K, it won't lyse it because it doesn't replicate within the host. That explains why only strain B is affected.\n\nSo now, when they dilute the surviving half (which should be resistant) 1:10^7, they plate on strain B. The number of plasmids detected here depends on whether the phage integrated into the host. Since it's lysogenic, the phage shouldn't integrate into strain B, so it shouldn't lyse it. Therefore, the plasmid should not appear on strain B. But wait, the result says four pluses on K and 40 on B. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage on strain B causes replication, leading to more phage particles, but upon lysis, they release DNA. This DNA could have mutations, specifically recombination events. If the phage has recombined with the host genome during replication, it introduces new mutations.\n\nIn the scenario where both mutations occur, each phage might have an independent chance to recombine with the host. If both mutations are present on the same phage, their product would be recombinant. The probability of recombination between two regions is given by the formula p = 1 - e^{-2q}, where q is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut how does this relate to the experiment results? Let me consider the test cross. After the initial infection, they plate the survivors on strain B. If the survivors have a recombination event, then some should survive and lyse, contributing to the plasmids. However, in this case, the survivors on B are supposed to be resistant, but in the next experiment, they have some plasmids.\n\nWait, maybe it's about interference. The initial infection caused some cells to die, then the remaining ones were treated for selection. The treatment with 1:10^7 would select against the resistant clones. Then, when plated on strain B, the resistant clones should not produce plasmids, but the survivors (from the resistant clones) should still be resistant to the phage.\n\nBut the results show that on K, there are four pluses, suggesting some resistance, while on B, there are 40 pluses. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The key here is the interference. The initial infection causes some cells to die, then they are selected. The selective pressure reduces the number of resistant cells. Then, when these are plated on strain B, they should be resistant to the phage, so no plasmids should appear. But instead, some plasmids do appear, indicating that the phages did replicate within the resistant cells.\n\nTherefore, the phages must have integrated into the host genome, causing replication, and releasing DNA that may have mutations. The integration of a phage typically involves crossing over between two regions, which is a form of recombination.\n\nThe level of recombination needed to explain the observed effect can be calculated. The expected number of plasmids (if recombination occurred) is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Alternatively, the formula relating recombination frequency (f) to the number of plasmids (m) is m = sqrt(f).\n\nGiven that in the first treatment, half the colonies are killed, and the other half are selected. Then, when these are plated on strain B, some plasmids (four) indicate that the phages replicated within the resistant clones. Similarly, when plated on strain K, four plasmids indicate some resistance there too.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids between the two strains is important. The number of plasmids on K is four, and on B, it's 40. The ratio is 1:10. According to the model, the number of plasmids is related to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m = sqrt(f), implying that f = m\u00b2.\n\nIf m is 4, then f = 16%, which is approximately 0.16. However, looking at the options provided, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. None match exactly, but 0.16 is close to 0.1%, which is option D (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, considering that the actual calculation might involve a factor like 1000 due to the high dilution, the recombination frequency could be higher.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plasmids detected in the test cross relates to the number of recombination events. For a two-region system, the expected number of plasmids is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, if m is the number of plasmids, m = k * sqrt(f), where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the data, we have m_B = 40 and m_K = 4. Assuming the same k, 4 = k * sqrt(f) and 40 = k * sqrt(f). Wait, that can't be right because that would imply 4 = 40, which is impossible. Instead, perhaps the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to sqrt(f). Or perhaps the ratio of plasmids reflects the square of the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother way: The number of plasmids detected in the test cross is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m = sqrt(f). If m_B / m_K = sqrt(f_B / f_K). From the data, m_B = 40, m_K = 4, so 40/4 = 10 = sqrt(f_B / f_K). Squaring both sides gives f_B/f_K = 100. So f_B = 100*f_K.\n\nAssuming that both regions have the same recombination frequency, f_B = f_K, so this implies that f_B = f_K = 100*f_K, which would require f_K=0, which contradicts the data. Therefore, my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the number of plasmids detected is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m \u221d sqrt(f). Therefore, m_B = sqrt(f) * c, m_K = sqrt(f) * c. Dividing gives m_B/m_K = 1, which again conflicts with the data.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption about the relationship is incorrect. Let me reconsider. If the recombination frequency affects the number of plasmids, perhaps the number of plasmids is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So, m \u221d f\u00b2. Then, m_B / m_K = f_B\u00b2 / f_K\u00b2. Given m_B =40, m_K=4, 40/4=10 = (f_B/f_K)^2 \u2192 f_B/f_K = sqrt(10)= approx 3.16. Again, assuming equal f, this can't hold.\n\nAlternative approach: The interference in the initial selection can affect the number of plasmids. The interference coefficient \u03b2 is given by \u03b2 = (number of dead cells + 1)/total cells. Here, half the cells died, so \u03b2 = (0.5 +1)/1 = 1.5.\n\nThe number of plasmids detected is N = (\u03b2 + 1)/(2\u03b2). Plugging in \u03b2=1.5: N = 2.5/(3) \u22480.83. But our data shows N_B=40, which is much higher than this. So this approach might not fit either.\n\nMaybe I should look for a simpler formula. The probability of a recombination event between two loci is given by f. The expected number of plasmids from such a recombination is proportional to sqrt(f). So, if m_B = 40 and m_K=4, then 40/4 =10 = sqrt(f_B/f_K). Thus, f_B/f_K =100 \u2192 f_B =100*f_K. Assuming f_B=f_K, this is impossible, so likely f_B=100*f_K.\n\nBut without knowing f_K, how can I find f_B? Perhaps I'm missing information about f_K. Alternatively, maybe the recombination frequency between the two regions is the same as the difference in plasmid counts.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement, the plate results suggest that the resistance caused by the phages led to a certain number of plasmids. Each time a phage integrates into the host, it may create new mutations, increasing the number of plasmids.\n\nThe exact calculation requires knowing the recombination frequency, but the possible answers suggest that the correct answer is 0.1 percent, which is option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. Strain K isn't affected, which probably means it's using the lysogenic phage as well or maybe it's another mutation elsewhere.\n\nNow, when they plate strain B, half the colonies die, then they dilute that half 1:10^7 and plate again on strain B. In this second experiment, there are four pluses on K and 40 on B. Similarly, the other half was dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, resulting in four pluses on K and zero on B.\n\nWait, let me clarify. So the first half is dilated 1:10^7 and then plated on strain B. If four colonies have plumes, that suggests that some of those were resistant to the phage. But since it's plate on strain B, any plumes would mean the phage didn't kill them, meaning they're resistant\u2014so if the phage is lysogenic, it should lyse, right? Wait, no, because the lysogenic phage should integrate into the bacterial chromosome, making it lysogenic, so it shouldn't lyse unless something else happens.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think differently. The initial infection by lysogenic phages on strain B leads to death, while lysogenic on strain K might cause resistance because perhaps the phage is neutralizing the lysogeny somehow.\n\nWait, actually, lysogenic phages don't replicate inside the host; they integrate into the genome and become part of the phage particle. They lyse the bacterium when they infect it. So if the lysogenic phage integrates into strain B, it will lyse it, killing all its descendants. However, if the lysogenic phage integrates into strain K, it won't lyse it because it doesn't replicate within the host. That explains why only strain B is affected.\n\nSo now, when they dilute the surviving half (which should be resistant) 1:10^7, they plate on strain B. The number of plasmids detected here depends on whether the phage integrated into the host. Since it's lysogenic, the phage shouldn't integrate into strain B, so it shouldn't lyse it. Therefore, the plasmid should not appear on strain B. But wait, the result says four pluses on K and 40 on B. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the process.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage on strain B causes replication, leading to more phage particles, but upon lysis, they release DNA. This DNA could have mutations, specifically recombination events. If the phage has recombined with the host genome during replication, it introduces new mutations.\n\nIn the scenario where both mutations occur, each phage might have an independent chance to recombine with the host. If both mutations are present on the same phage, their product would be recombinant. The probability of recombination between two regions is given by the formula p = 1 - e^{-2q}, where q is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut how does this relate to the experiment results? Let me consider the test cross. After the initial infection, they plate the survivors on strain B. If the survivors have a recombination event, then some should survive and lyse, contributing to the plasmids. However, in this case, the survivors on B are supposed to be resistant, but in the next experiment, they have some plasmids.\n\nWait, maybe it's about interference. The initial infection caused some cells to die, then the remaining ones were treated for selection. The treatment with 1:10^7 would select against the resistant clones. Then, when plated on strain B, the resistant clones should not produce plasmids, but the survivors (from the resistant clones) should still be resistant to the phage.\n\nBut the results show that on K, there are four pluses, suggesting some resistance, while on B, there are 40 pluses. That seems inconsistent. Perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nLet me try a different approach. The key here is the interference. The initial infection causes some cells to die, then they are selected. The selective pressure reduces the number of resistant cells. Then, when these are plated on strain B, they should be resistant to the phage, so no plasmids should appear. But instead, some plasmids do appear, indicating that the phages did replicate within the resistant cells.\n\nTherefore, the phages must have integrated into the host genome, causing replication, and releasing DNA that may have mutations. The integration of a phage typically involves crossing over between two regions, which is a form of recombination.\n\nThe level of recombination needed to explain the observed effect can be calculated. The expected number of plasmids (if recombination occurred) is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. Alternatively, the formula relating recombination frequency (f) to the number of plasmids (m) is m = sqrt(f).\n\nGiven that in the first treatment, half the colonies are killed, and the other half are selected. Then, when these are plated on strain B, some plasmids (four) indicate that the phages replicated within the resistant clones. Similarly, when plated on strain K, four plasmids indicate some resistance there too.\n\nThe ratio of plasmids between the two strains is important. The number of plasmids on K is four, and on B, it's 40. The ratio is 1:10. According to the model, the number of plasmids is related to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m = sqrt(f), implying that f = m\u00b2.\n\nIf m is 4, then f = 16%, which is approximately 0.16. However, looking at the options provided, D is 0.05% and F is 0.3%. None match exactly, but 0.16 is close to 0.1%, which is option D (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, considering that the actual calculation might involve a factor like 1000 due to the high dilution, the recombination frequency could be higher.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plasmids detected in the test cross relates to the number of recombination events. For a two-region system, the expected number of plasmids is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, if m is the number of plasmids, m = k * sqrt(f), where k is a constant.\n\nFrom the data, we have m_B = 40 and m_K = 4. Assuming the same k, 4 = k * sqrt(f) and 40 = k * sqrt(f). Wait, that can't be right because that would imply 4 = 40, which is impossible. Instead, perhaps the number of plasmids is inversely proportional to sqrt(f). Or perhaps the ratio of plasmids reflects the square of the recombination frequency.\n\nAnother way: The number of plasmids detected in the test cross is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m = sqrt(f). If m_B / m_K = sqrt(f_B / f_K). From the data, m_B = 40, m_K = 4, so 40/4 = 10 = sqrt(f_B / f_K). Squaring both sides gives f_B/f_K = 100. So f_B = 100*f_K.\n\nAssuming that both regions have the same recombination frequency, f_B = f_K, so this implies that f_B = f_K = 100*f_K, which would require f_K=0, which contradicts the data. Therefore, my assumption is wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the number of plasmids detected is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency. So, m \u221d sqrt(f). Therefore, m_B = sqrt(f) * c, m_K = sqrt(f) * c. Dividing gives m_B/m_K = 1, which again conflicts with the data.\n\nThis suggests that the initial assumption about the relationship is incorrect. Let me reconsider. If the recombination frequency affects the number of plasmids, perhaps the number of plasmids is proportional to the square of the recombination frequency. So, m \u221d f\u00b2.

Hmm, no, the question says the other half is plated on strain K, so presumably they're testing the effect of the mutation on the phage itself rather than the host.\n\nWait, no, actually, the phage is the same across both plates.

Unless the host resistance somehow depends on the phage, but that seems unlikely.\n\nSo if the lysogenic phage is present, regardless of the host strain, it should either lyse or not, depending on its replication.

That suggests that the mutation in the phage allows it to replicate enough times to lyse the cell. But when the same phage is plated on strain K, which shouldn't be affected because the mutation is within the phage, why wouldn't any cells die?\n\nAh, maybe strain K is resistant to the lysogenic phage even though it's different from strain B. Wait, but that's not possible because the mutation is within the phage. Unless the host's own resistance mechanisms are bypassed by the phage's mutation. Maybe the lysogenic phage is somehow able to replicate better on certain resistances of the host.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation affects the viability of the phage on strain K. But that doesn't make sense because the mutation is in the phage itself.\n\nWait, let's approach this methodically. The number of plumes indicates how many cells were successfully lysed. More plumes mean more successful infections. Since the lysogenic phage was present on both plates, but only the lysogenic phage on strain B was successful, while on strain K, maybe it wasn't successful, hence fewer plumes.\n\nBut according to the results, strain B had 40 plumes, and strain K had 4. So four times fewer on strain K. Why? Perhaps because the lysogenic phage is less effective on strain K, but that contradicts the earlier statement that strain B was only lysed when lysogenic phage was present.\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup. The two halves are each mixed with their respective host strains. So the first half is 1:10^7 phage on strain B, and the second half is 1:10^5 phage on strain K. So in total, the phage concentrations are different, leading to different numbers of plumes.\n\nIf the mutation makes the lysogenic phage more effective, then a higher concentration would lead to more plumes. But here, the concentration on strain B is higher (1:10^7 vs. 1:10^5), yet it still resulted in more plumes on strain B. That suggests that the mutation may not be fully dominant or that the host's ability to respond matters.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutation confers increased plasmid load on the phage, making it more efficient at lysing cells, but since strain K is more resistant, perhaps the lysogenic phage doesn't work well there despite having the mutation.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try again. The lysogenic phage is supposed to integrate into the host DNA and replicate, causing the cell to lyse upon lysis.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

Only four plates have a lysic phenotype here, meaning the lysogenic phage from the first experiment survived and caused lysis again. On the other side, half are treated with a 1:10^5 dilution and placed on strain B lawn. Here, 40 plates show lysosis, indicating the lysogenic phage didn't survive as well this time.\n\nFrom this, I think the key point is about the interaction between the two mutations. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication, which determines whether the new phage integrates into the host genome or remains separate. If there was no recombination, the two mutations would cause different effects\u2014like the lysogenic phage doing both, while the lytic phage causing only lysosis.\n\nIn the first experiment, only lysogenic phages cause death on strain B. When the lysogenic phage is present on strain K, it might either kill if it's another lysogenic phage or survive if it's a different type. But since in the second experiment, some lysogenic phages didn't survive, it suggests that some of them were successfully integrated into the K genome, leading to their survival. This indicates that recombination occurred because the lysogenic phage could now integrate into the K chromosome, allowing it to survive when plated on strain B.\n\nWait, actually, if there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage should remain on the K chromosome and replicate normally, right? Because the original lysogenic phage wouldn't integrate into the host genome without recombination. So if it's not surviving on strain B, maybe that means integration happened. Or perhaps the opposite\u2014if it wasn't integrating, it would have replicated normally and replicate more often, leading to more lysosis.\n\nBut looking at the numbers: on strain K, 40 out of 50 died, which is less than half, suggesting that some of the lysogenic phages did integrate into K. Because if they didn't integrate, they would replicate more efficiently, leading to more lysis, which isn't what we see here. So integration must have happened, implying recombination.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. If the effect on strain B shows that the lysogenic phage couldn't replicate, possibly because it didn't integrate, then recombination explains why it worked on strain K. Since only 4 out of 50 died on K, that's 8%, which seems high. Maybe I'm misunderstanding.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination rate affects how many times the phage integrates, affecting the number of lysogenic phages present. If the recombination rate is low, fewer phages integrate, leading to higher efficiency and more lysosis on strain B. If recombination is high, more phages integrate, reducing the number of lysogenic phages, thus decreasing lysosis on strain B.\n\nGiven that on strain K, only 4 out of 50 died, which is lower than on strain B, this implies that recombination increased the likelihood of successful replication on K, thus reducing the number of lysogenic phages. So the higher the recombination rate, the fewer lysogenic phages survive.\n\nTo find the exact recombination rate, I'd use the formula for expected number of recombinant events. The observed number of recombinants can be used to estimate the recombination frequency (rf). The formula is rf = (observed - expected)/expected. Assuming no recombination (rf=0), expected number would be the total number of phages multiplied by the probability of recombination.\n\nBut wait, in this case, all the lysogenic phages from the first experiment should ideally have integrated into the K genome if there's no recombination. However, in reality, some didn't integrate, leading to reduced lysosis on K. So the observed number of non-integrated phages is 4 out of 50, which is 8%. That's an 8% recombination rate, but none of the options go that high. Hmm.\n\nLooking back, the possible answers are up to 0.5% (F) or 5% (I). Wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me recalculate:\n\nIf on strain B, 50 plates died, and on strain K, 40 died. The difference is 10. If recombination increased the number of phages that didn't integrate on K, then the ratio would be 4/50 = 8% recombination. But that's way too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of recombination events. Let's say r is the recombination rate. Then the fraction of phages that integrate is r/(1 + r). So the expected number of phages that don't integrate on K would be (1 - r)/(1 + r) * 50. Setting this equal to 4 gives:\n\n(1 - r)/(1 + r) * 50 = 4 \u2192 (1 - r)/(1 + r) = 4/50 = 2/25 \u2192 25(1 - r) = 2(1 + r) \u2192 25 -25r = 2 + 2r \u2192 25-2=25r+2r\u219223=27r\u2192r\u22480.85\u219285%.\n\nThat's impossible because the options don't go that high. So perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of non-integrating phages on K is 4, and on B is 50. The ratio is 4/50=8%, which suggests that 8% of the phages didn't integrate on K. So recombination rate would be approximately 8%.\n\nBut the options don't include 8%. Closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Alternatively, perhaps the recombination rate is calculated differently.\n\nAnother angle: The number of successful integrations on K is 4, and on B is 50. If there's no recombination, all phages would integrate on K, so all 50 would integrate, but in reality, only 4 didn't. So the recombination rate would be (50 -4)/50 =46/50=92%, which is also impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is rf = (number of non-integrating phages)/(total phages). So rf = 4/50=0.08\u21928%. But the options don't have 8%. Perhaps the answer is F (0.3%), assuming rounding down.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 4 out of 50 is 8%, which is close to 1%, so option A (1%) might make sense. But 8% isn't exactly 1% or 0.5%.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check:\n\nIf rf is the recombination frequency, then the proportion of phages that successfully integrate is rf/(1 + rf). So the expected number of phages that didn't integrate on K would be (1 - rf/(1 + rf)) * 50 = 4.\n\nLet\u2019s solve for rf:\n\n(1 - rf/(1 + rf)) * 50 =4 \u2192 (1 - rf/(1 + rf)) =4/50=0.08 \u2192 rf/(1 + rf)=0.92 \u2192 rf=0.92*(1 + rf) \u2192 rf=0.92 +0.92rf \u2192 rf -0.92rf=0.92 \u2192 0.08rf=0.92 \u2192 rf=11.5%\n\nHmm, that's 11.5%, which is still not among the options. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nPerhaps the problem is simpler: the observed number of non-integrating phages on K is 4 out of 50. If there was complete recombination, all phages would integrate on K, so 0 would be non-integrating. If no recombination, 50 would be non-integrating. With some recombination, the number is somewhere in between.\n\nSo rf = (number non-integrating)/(number total) =4/50=0.08\u21928%.\n\nAgain, no option matches 8%. Looking back at the options, the highest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Maybe I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps the actual calculation uses the formula rf = (number of failed to integrate)/(total phages). So 4/50=0.08\u21928%. But since the options don't have 8%, perhaps the intended answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question expects us to calculate based on the ratio of successful vs unsuccessful. On K, 4 succeeded, on B, 50 failed. If successful integration increases the number of phages that don't fail, then the recombination rate can be estimated.\n\nWait, let's try:\n\nSuppose r is the recombination rate. The expected number of phages that successfully integrate is r/(1 + r)*N. Therefore, the number of phages that don't integrate is N*(1 - r/(1 + r)) = N*r/(1 + r).\n\nOn K, 4 phages didn't integrate, so 4 = (50 * r)/(1 + r). Solving for r:\n\n4(1 + r) =50r \u21924 +4r=50r \u21924=46r \u2192r\u22480.087\u21928.7%.\n\nStill around 8.7%, which isn't in the options. Maybe the intended answer is C (1.5%) assuming a different approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is asking for the percentage of recombination per locus, considering that each phage has a certain probability of recombining. If the recombination rate is 1%, then the chance of recombining once is 1%, so the probability of recombining twice is 1%*1%=0.01%. But I'm not sure if that's applicable here.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of recombined phages is proportional to the square root of the number, but that's getting complicated.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the best guess is that the recombination rate is approximately 1%, so the answer is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Normally, if the lysogenic phage isn't active on strain K, why would there be any colonies on K?\n\nWait, let me think again. Maybe the initial groups are being tested separately. So Group X (mutants with both mutations) are placed on strain B, and Group Y (mutants with only lysogenic?) are placed on strain K. Then, each group leads to a division in half. On strain B, Group X causes division, while Group Y doesn't because their lysogenic mutation isn't active on strain B. On strain K, Group Y would be unaffected because the lysogenic mutation isn't active there. So why do we get 40 pluses on B and 4 on K?\n\nThat suggests that the lysogenic mutation in Group Y is actually working on strain B, meaning it's active there despite strain B not lysing. That contradicts the problem statement which said that lysogenic phages don't lyse strain B. So perhaps I've misunderstood how the groups are set up.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the mutants are such that when placed on strain B, only those with lysogenic mutation die, and those with lytic also die. But since only lysogenic affects strain B, Group Y (with only lytic) wouldn't die. Wait, but the problem states that both groups are causing the colonies to divide into half. So Group X (mutant with both) dies, leading to division, while Group Y (mutant with only lysogenic) doesn't die, so no division. \n\nThen, when Group X is placed on strain K, which doesn't lysize, the lysogenic mutation is active, leading to division. Meanwhile, Group Y, which has the lytic mutation, is placed on strain K, where the lysogeny is irrelevant, so the lytic mutation shouldn't cause death. Therefore, Group Y would replicate, growing on strain K as well, resulting in fewer pluses on K compared to B.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses on K was 4, and on B it was 40. This ratio suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is low because only a small fraction of the mutants survive. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations are on the same gene or different genes. If they are on the same gene, they may be redundant, leading to less survival. If they are on different genes, their effects might add up.\n\nGiven that the number of pluses on K is much lower than on B, this indicates that the lysogenic mutation is more likely to act on strain K, suggesting they are recombined. The exact calculation would involve using the formula for double-reciprocal selection to determine the probability of recombination. But perhaps in this case, since the numbers are such that only 4 out of 40 are successful, it implies that about 10% of the mutants survive. In the context of genetic recombination, a 10% survival rate suggests that approximately 1% of the mutants have recombined, making the answer A. 1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Meanwhile, Group Y, which has the lytic mutation, is placed on strain K, where the lysogeny is irrelevant, so the lytic mutation shouldn't cause death. Therefore, Group Y would replicate, growing on strain K as well, resulting in fewer pluses on K compared to B.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of pluses on K was 4, and on B it was 40. This ratio suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is low because only a small fraction of the mutants survive. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations are on the same gene or different genes. If they are on the same gene, they may be redundant, leading to less survival. If they are on different genes, their effects might add up.\n\nGiven that the number of pluses on K is much lower than on B, this indicates that the lysogenic mutation is more likely to act on strain K, suggesting they are recombined. The exact calculation would involve using the formula for double-reciprocal selection to determine the probability of recombination. But perhaps in this case, since the numbers are such that only 4 out of 40 are successful, it implies that about 10% of the mutants survive. In the context of genetic recombination, a 10% survival rate suggests that approximately 1% of the mutants have recombined, making the answer A. 1 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

They plate half of them on a lawn of strain B, diluting it 1:10^7, and then another half on a lawn of strain K, diluting it 1:10^5. The counts are 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. \n\nHmm, I remember that when you have two mutations, the probability that they cause different outcomes depends on how often they combine. So if the two mutations are independent, the chance they don't cause different effects would be low. But here, since only lysogenic phages affect strain B, maybe we're looking at their interaction causing issues in certain combinations.\n\nThe formula for recombinant frequency (RF) is RF = [(p1 * p2) - q] / p1 + p2), where p1 and p2 are the frequencies of each mutation. Wait, actually, I think it's RF = [p1*p2*(1 - q)] / (p1 + p2 - 2*q), but I'm getting confused. Maybe I should look up the basic formula for RF.\n\nWait, no, perhaps it's simpler. If the two mutations independently occur, the probability that they cause different effects is 1 - (p1 + p2 - 2pq), where pq is the probability of both occurring together. But in our case, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So if the two mutations are linked, the lysogenic phage won't express either mutation unless they're combined.\n\nIn the experiment, on strain B, half the phages were lysogenic (let's say frequency p1) and half were wild-type (frequency p2). On strain K, all were wild-type, right? Because only lysogenic phages affect strain B. So when you plate the lysogenic phages from strain B, some will cause problems because they're combining with the wild-type phages, which might lead to double resistance or something else. But wait, in the experiment, only the lysogenic phages caused issues on strain B, meaning they must be resistant to both mutations. Or maybe they're resistant to one and not the other.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the expected number of plasmids in the test plates. If both mutations are independent and each occurs with frequency q, then the probability that a phage has neither mutation is (1-q)^2, both mutations are (q)^2, etc. But in this case, only the lysogenic phages (wild-type) are expressing the mutation, so if the phage is wild-type, it's q, and if it's lysogenic, it's 1-q.\n\nWhen you plate these on strain B, only the lysogenic ones (1-q) will cause problems because the wild-type ones (q) wouldn't affect strain B. So the number of plasmids on B's plate would depend on whether the phage is wild-type or lysogenic. Similarly, on strain K, all phages are wild-type, so any plasmid would be from a wild-type phage.\n\nWait, but the actual counting was 40 plumes on K and 4 on B. Each plume corresponds to a bacterium that picked up a phage. So on strain B, half the phages were wild-type (q), and half were lysogenic (1-q). If a bacterium picks up a lysogenic phage, it would have the mutation and die. If it picks up a wild-type phage, it survives. But since only lysogenic phages are on strain B, the surviving bacteria are those without lysogenic phages, i.e., those with only wild-type phages. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the lysogenic phages themselves are already causing issues.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify: the lysogenic phages are responsible for producing DNA gyrase, leading to lysis. Wild-type phages produce peptidase, which is active and doesn't cause lysis. So when a bacterium picks up a lysogenic phage, it dies. If it picks up a wild-type phage, it survives. But in this scenario, only lysogenic phages affect strain B. So when you plate the lysogenic phages from strain B, some will die because they pick up lysogenic phages, while others will survive if they pick up wild-type phages. Wait, but the problem says that only the lysogenic phages cause the lytic fission in strain B, meaning that the lysogenic phages themselves are the ones causing the issue. So the wild-type phages aren't affecting strain B, which makes sense because only the lysogenic ones are expressed.\n\nNow, the other half is plated on strain K, which is unaffected by lysogenic phages. So any plasmid picked up on strain K would come from a wild-type phage, which doesn't cause issues. Therefore, on strain B, the plasmids come from either lysogenic or wild-type phages. Only the lysogenic ones are harmful, so the number of plasmids on B's plate would correspond to the number of lysogenic phages. Similarly, on K's plate, all plasmids come from wild-type phages, which are safe.\n\nBut according to the experiment, on strain B, 40 plumes appeared, and on K, 4. Assuming that each plume represents a successful infection, the ratio could help determine the probabilities. However, the exact mapping might require knowing the expected numbers under independence.\n\nIf the two mutations are independent, the probability that a phage carries both mutations is p1*p2. The probability that it carries none is (1-p1)(1-p2). Since only lysogenic phages affect strain B, the presence of lysogenic phages implies that the phage may or may not carry the other mutation. Wait, but the lysogenic phages themselves don't carry mutations; they just replicate. So the plasmids on strain B's plate come from either lysogenic or wild-type phages.\n\nWait, now I'm getting mixed up. Let me try again. The lysogenic phages are wild-type, meaning they produce DNA gyrase, leading to lysis. Wild-type phages are not expressed because they are lysogenic. So when you plate the lysogenic phages (from strain B), some will die (because they pick up lysogenic phages) and others will survive (if they pick up wild-type phages). But wait, no\u2014strain B is being plated with lysogenic phages, which are wild-type, so they can't cause lysis. Hmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding.\n\nLet me approach this differently. The experiment involves mixing two types of mutantphages on strain B. So the lysogenic phage (which causes lytic fission in strain B) and the wild-type phage (which doesn't affect strain B) are both present. Then, they plate half of them on strain B and half on strain K. The results show that on strain B, 40 plumes appeared, and on K, 4. \n\nAssuming that each plume indicates successful infection, the total number of plasmids would relate to the number of phages present. Let's consider the proportions. If the two mutations are linked, the number of recombinants (mutated phages) would be less than expected under independence. \n\nGiven that only the lysogenic phage (wild-type) affects strain B, the plasmids on strain B's plate would include some wild-type phages. The plasmids on strain K's plate would only include wild-type phages, as strain B's lysogenic phages don't affect strain K.\n\nSo, the plasmid concentration on B's plate would be a mix of wild-type phages and possibly some lysogenic ones (but lysogenic ones don't carry mutations). Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phages are wild-type, so they don't carry any mutations. So the plasmids on B's plate would be from either lysogenic or wild-type phages, depending on whether the phage carried the mutation.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused again. Let's try to model it mathematically. Let\u2019s assume that each type of mutantphage is equally likely to occur, so the frequency of lysogenic phages (q) and wild-type phages (p=1-q) on each strain.\n\nOn strain B, half the phages are lysogenic (q) and half are wild-type (p). When you plate these on strain B, the lysogenic phages themselves don\u2019t carry mutations (since they\u2019re wild-type), but the wild-type phages do. However, the lysogenic phages can reproduce within themselves, so some might accumulate more plasmids. But in reality, the lysogenic phages don't contribute to mutations; they just replicate.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not correct. Lysogenic phages do contribute to mutations because they are responsible for DNA gyrase production, which leads to lysis. So if a lysogenic phage is present, it can cause lysis, but that's a functional effect, not a genetic mutation. So the presence of lysogenic phages doesn't directly cause mutations; they just replicate and replicate rapidly.\n\nTherefore, the lysogenic phages (wild-type) don't cause mutations and thus don't interfere with the plasmid load in terms of causing new mutations. So when you plate the lysogenic phages on strain B, some will die due to lysis (they pick up lysogenic phages), and others will survive if they pick up wild-type phages. Wait, but strain B is being plated with lysogenic phages, so the survivors would come from wild-type phages. But wait, no\u2014if you plate the lysogenic phages on strain B, which itself produces lysogenic phages, then the phages present on strain B would be a mixture of lysogenic and wild-type. But wait, that doesn't make sense because the lysogenic phages are already produced by the host.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Let me try a different approach. Suppose that the two mutations are linked, and the recombination frequency (RF) is r%. The RF is calculated using the formula:\n\nRF = [(p1 * p2) - q] / (p1 + p2 - 2q)\n\nWhere p1 and p2 are the allele frequencies of each mutation, and q is the interference parameter (the probability that both mutations occur together).\n\nBut in this case, since only the lysogenic phage (wild-type) affects strain B, the plasmids on strain B would come from either wild-type phages (safe) or lysogenic phages (potentially non-functional). Wait, but lysogenic phages are wild-type, so they don't carry mutations. Therefore, the plasmids on strain B would consist of some wild-type phages (which don't cause mutations) and some lysogenic phages (which also don't cause mutations, but they are wild-type). This seems confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages causes a reduction in replication efficiency, leading to fewer plasmids. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, let me think about the expected plasmid count. If the two mutations are independent, the number of recombinant plasmids (those carrying both mutations) would be r% of the total. In the experiment, on strain B, 40 plumes appeared, and on K, 4. The total plasmids would be 40 + 4 = 44.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are linked and that the expected number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the allele frequencies, but since only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, perhaps the plasmids on strain B are coming from wild-type phages, and the plasmids on strain K are also coming from wild-type phages.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phages are wild-type, so they shouldn't carry mutations. Therefore, the plasmids on strain B's plate would come from wild-type phages, and the plasmids on strain K's plate would also come from wild-type phages, implying that the mutations are not affecting the plasmid load beyond what's already present.\n\nBut why did the experiment show four recombinant plasmids on K and forty on B? That suggests that some plasmids are carrying both mutations, which would be recombinants. So perhaps the mutations are acting on the same chromosome, making them linked, and the occurrence of both mutations in the same plasmid is rare.\n\nIn that case, the number of recombinant plasmids would be related to the square of the interference parameter. If the mutations are tightly linked, the interference is high, reducing the probability of both mutations occurring together.\n\nGiven that, the number of recombinant plasmids (r) would be approximately equal to the square root of the number of recombinants observed. Here, on strain B, 40 plumes appear, and on K, 4. So, assuming the same number of plasmids, the number of recombinants would be sqrt(40) \u2248 6.32 on B and sqrt(4) = 2 on K. But that doesn't quite fit.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of recombinant plasmids on B to K, it's 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. If the number of recombinants is proportional to the product of the allele frequencies, and assuming the same number of plasmids, then the product of the frequencies would be r% for B and s% for K. But since the mutations are linked, r and s should be close.\n\nHowever, without more specific data, it's hard to calculate exactly. But given the options provided, which are percentages like 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., the most plausible answer among the choices is probably 0.02% or 0.05%.\n\nWait, but I recall that the number of recombinants can be approximated by the formula:\n\nNumber of recombinants = 2 * n * p1 * p2 * q,\n\nwhere n is the number of bacteria, p1 and p2 are the allele frequencies, and q is the interference parameter. But this is getting too detailed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of recombinants on B is much higher than on K, it suggests that the mutations are acting on the same chromosome and are tightly linked, leading to lower recombination rates. Thus, the recombination frequency would be relatively low, around 0.02-0.05%.\n\nLooking back at the options, F is 0.3 percent, G is 0.5 percent, H is 5 percent. None of these are very small, except F and G. Given that the experiment showed significant differences between B and K, it's likely that the recombination frequency is low. So between F (0.3%) and G (0.5%), I'd go with G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but another thought: if the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants would be (p1*p2)*(total plasmids). But in this case, the mutations are linked, so the expected recombinants would be zero, which contradicts the observation of four recombinant plasmids on K. Hence, the mutations must be linked, and the recombination frequency is low.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, the closest answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Between these, I'll choose G (0.5%) because it's closer to my initial thought.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

But in this case, the mutations are linked, so the expected recombinants would be zero, which contradicts the observation of four recombinant plasmids on K. Hence, the mutations must be linked, and the recombination frequency is low.\n\nGiven that, and considering the options, the closest answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Between these, I'll choose G (0.5%) because it's closer to my initial thought.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

    "rollout": " But when they infect strain K, which probably has a different origin or mutation, both types cause issues, right?\n\nWait, actually, no. The problem says that strain B is infected by two types of mutantphages simultaneously, and strain K isn't affected. So maybe strain B's mutations lead to both types causing issues, while strain K's mutations don't? Or perhaps only certain combinations do what we observe.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the culture into two groups: one is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, resulting in 40 plumes (plques), and the other group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn, yielding 4 pluses. Wait, the wording says \"four plaques\" on K and 40 on B, but the way it's written might be confusing. Oh, wait, it's more likely that each group was plated individually. So when you plate on strain B's lawn, you get 40 plumes, and on strain K's lawn, you get 4 plumes. \n\nNow, the key here is that the number of plumes depends on the probability of recombination. Recombination would mean that the two mutations occurred at different sites within the T_4 phage genome. If they're recombined, the phage can integrate the mutation, leading to either a loss-of-function or gain-of-function mutation. This integration increases the probability that the phage will lyse the host cell, as it now carries both mutations.\n\nIn the experiment, the presence of two types of phages (mutant) leads to a higher rate of lysis than with a single type. However, since some cells are resistant (no lysis), the distribution of plumes depends on how often the mutations integrated into the phage.\n\nWhen you plate on strain B, the higher number of plumes (40 vs. 4) suggests that the phages from strain B are more likely to lyse the cells because their mutations didn't integrate well. On strain K, fewer plumes (4) mean better integration, so the phages from there are less likely to lyse. But wait, the initial condition was that both mutantphages were present in the same culture. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the first group (diluted 1:10^7) is plate on strain B's lawn, which is a different strain of E. coli. So if the phages from strain B cause issues on strain B's lawn, but the other group is on strain K's lawn. Since strain K wasn't affected, the phages must have been integrating their mutations into the phage DNA, making them function better. That makes sense because if the phages have integrated their mutations into the DNA, they'd replicate without being lost upon lysis.\n\nSo the number of plumes indicates the probability of recombination. More plumes suggest lower recombination because it's harder for the phages to integrate. Fewer plumes indicate higher recombination.\n\nGiven that there are four plumes on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's, the ratio is about 1:10. Now, the expected number of plumes when there's perfect recombination (no integration) should be around 1/(p*q), where p and q are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. But in reality, with recombination, the probability changes.\n\nHowever, another approach is to consider the probability that a phage carrying both mutations (recombined) will lyse the cell. Without recombination, the probability is zero (since one mutation would dominate). With recombination, the probability increases.\n\nBut in this case, since some cells are resistant (no lysis), the observed number of plumes relates to the probability of recombination. The formula used in such experiments is:\n\nNumber of plumes = (probability of recombination) \u00d7 total cells.\n\nAssuming each cell has an independent chance, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the probability of recombination.\n\nGiven that on strain B's lawn, you see 40 plumes, and on strain K's, 4, the ratio is roughly 10:1. This implies that the probability of recombination is low, meaning that the mutations are not integrated very often.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, let's assume that the expected number of plumes when there's no recombination is N, and with recombination, it's N \u00d7 (1 - r), where r is the recombination frequency (as a decimal).\n\nIf we set N \u00d7 (1 - r) = 40, and N \u00d7 (1 - r)^2 = 4, then dividing these equations gives (1 - r)^2 / (1 - r) = 4/40 \u2192 (1 - r) = 0.1 \u2192 r = 0.9.\n\nWait, that seems high, but let's check again. Maybe I inverted something. Alternatively, considering the ratios directly: 40 / 4 = 10, implying that the probability of recombination is 1/10, so approximately 10%.\n\nBut looking back, the options provided don't include 10%. The closest option is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Hmm, maybe my approach is flawed.\n\nAnother approach is to use the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which measures the occurrence of linked events. The formula is:\n\nCOI = (Observed recombinant offspring) / (Expected recombinant offspring)\n\nBut I think this applies to independent assortment rather than recombination in phages. Alternatively, the formula for the probability of recombination given the number of plumes.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is:\n\nRecombination Frequency (rf) = (Number of plumes on K) / (Total plumes on both strains)\n\nBut that might not be accurate. Alternatively, considering that the presence of both mutations reduces the probability of lysis, and thus increases the likelihood of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps using the formula:\n\n rf = (Number of plumes on K) / (Total plumes) ) \u00d7 100\n\nBut in our case, the total plumes across both groups are 40 + 4 = 44. So rf = (4 / 44) \u00d7 100 \u2248 9.09%, which is close to 10%. Again, none of the options match exactly, but the closest is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%).\n\nHmm, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, the experiment involved two groups: one with 40 plumes and the other with 4. Assuming that the presence of recombination affects the number of plumes inversely. If there's less recombination, more plumes. But according to the data, more plumes on strain B's lawn than on strain K's, suggesting less recombination. So the recombination frequency is low.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the lowest is E (0.05%), followed by D (0.02%), etc. My calculation suggests ~9%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps I misapplied the formula.\n\nAlternative approach: The number of plumes on each strain is related to the probability of recombination. The expected number of plumes when there's no recombination is N, and when there's recombination, it's N \u00d7 (1 - r). But without knowing N, it's hard to apply.\n\nWait, perhaps the formula for calculating the recombination frequency based on plume counts is:\n\n rf = (log(Plumes on K)) / (log(Plumes on B))\n\nBut that's speculative. Alternatively, considering the ratio of plumes on each strain, the log base 10 of the ratio might relate to the recombination frequency.\n\nLet me try that:\n\nRatio = Plumes on K / Plumes on B = 4 / 40 = 0.1\n\nLog10(0.1) = -1\n\nThis could imply a recombination frequency of 10%, which again isn't an option.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two mutations are present, the probability of recombination increases the chance of lysogeny. The presence of two plumes suggests some integration, reducing the number of resistant cells. But without a clear mathematical model, it's challenging.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the product of the probabilities of each mutation. Suppose the probability of mutation A is p and mutation B is q. Then recombination occurs at frequency r, so the overall probability of lysogeny is p*(1 - r) + q*(1 - r) - pq*r + r*... Wait, this is getting too complex.\n\nMaybe the simplest way is to note that with recombination, the number of plumes decreases proportionally to the product of the mutation frequencies. If both mutations are rare, the chance of recombination is also low.\n\nGiven the options, and assuming that the correct answer is C (1.5%) or H (5%), but earlier calculations suggested around 9%, which doesn't fit any of those. Perhaps I miscalculated.\n\nWait, maybe the correct formula is:\n\n rf = (number of plumes on K) / (total plumes) \u00d7 100\n\nWhich would be (4 / 44) \u00d7 100 \u2248 9.09%, still not matching.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plumes is inversely proportional to the product of the mutation probabilities. Let\u2019s denote P_A and P_B as the probabilities of each mutation. Then the probability of recombination R is such that:\n\n(1 - R) = (P_A * P_B) / (something)\n\nBut without specific values for P_A and P_B, this is tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes reflects the probability of integration. If you have a 1% recombination frequency, then the number of plumes would be lower than expected. Given that we have 4 plumes on K and 40 on B, it's possible that the recombination frequency is 0.05% (option D), indicating that most mutations are retained, except for a small fraction that integrates.\n\nThus, the best answer based on the data and common biological principles is likely D (0.02%) or E (0.05%). Since 0.05% is closer to 9% when considering the reciprocal, but perhaps it's more precise to choose D (0.02%) as the recombination frequency.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The result was a saturation divided into two halves. One half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B lawn, giving four pluses. The other half was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, resulting in four pluses as well.\n\nWait, if both halves are dilute, then the number of plasmid copies per cell would be lower for the higher dilution. So the first half has a lot more cells, but fewer phages, while the second half has fewer cells, so the same number of phages mean more clonal spreading.\n\nIn the case where the mutation is lethal (like the lysogenic phage), only cells with the mutation will survive and spread. If the mutation is non-lethal, both clones might replicate, leading to more clonal expansion. But in this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, it should cause lysogenic replication, meaning both strains might replicate, but maybe the lysogenic ones die or replicate elsewhere? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up things.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when a lysogenic phage infects bacteria, it integrates its DNA into the host genome, becomes part of the lysosome, and then replicates. This leads to increased replication but also can cause more efficient lysogeny. However, if the phage is only lysogenic, it should still replicate within the same strain without affecting the host's lysogeny.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission; it's the opposite\u2014lytic fission means the phage fuses with the bacterial chromosome and replicates outside, causing the bacterium to lyse. So the lysogenic phage would lead to lysogenic replication, which is less efficient than lytic replication. Therefore, when you have a lysogenic phage, most offspring will be of the same type, so in a culture, you'd see more cells with the mutation and fewer without it.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment. When the two mutantphages infect strain B, the lysogenic phage (which is the one that affects strain B) dies off, while the lysogenic phage from the other type (non-lytic?) No, wait, the first mutant is \"mutant\" in the genomic region rII. Wait, the problem says T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. They can cause lytic or lysogenic fission.\n\nSo, the lysogenic phage would cause the lysogeny to occur, making the phage integrate into the host and replicate efficiently. But if the phage is non-lytic, it just integrates into the host but doesn't replicate outside, so it doesn't cause the lysogeny. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage is integrating, causing the lysogeny, but non-lytic phages don't do that.\n\nWait, but the phage carries a mutation in rII, which is associated with lysogenic fission. So, the lysogenic phage would cause the phage to integrate, leading to more efficient replication and more lysogeny.\n\nNow, when the phages infect strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something. Strain B may have been under selection against non-lytic phages, or perhaps they were exposed to phages that led to their death. So, strain B is resistant to non-lytic phages but susceptible to lysogenic ones.\n\nWhen both mutantphages are present, some of them are lysogenic and others are non-lytic. Wait, the description says \"mutant phage\", but it's unclear whether they're lytic or lysogenic. Wait, the problem states that the T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. These mutations could affect either lytic or lysogenic replication. Since the lysogenic phage causes the lysogeny, which is more efficient, I think these mutations are likely to affect lysogenic replication.\n\nSo, in the experiment, the two mutantphages are likely one that causes lysogenic fission (leads to lysogeny) and another that doesn't cause lysogenic fission (maybe non-lytic). Or vice versa.\n\nWhen both are present, the result is that half the colonies are divided into two groups: one half with higher dilution (more cells, fewer phages) and one half with lower dilution (fewer cells, more phages).\n\nPlated on strain B lawn, the first half (higher dilution) resulted in 4 plasmids, suggesting 4 cells with the mutation. Plated on strain K, the other half (lower dilution) resulted in 40 plasmids, meaning 40 cells with the mutation.\n\nWait, but actually, the numbers given are plasmid counts. So, if the mutation occurs, each cell with the mutation contributes one plasmid. So, 4 plasmids on strain B lawn would mean 4 cells with the mutation, and 40 plasmids on strain K would mean 40 cells with the mutation.\n\nNow, the total number of cells in each group is determined by the dilution factor. For the first group, it's 1:10^7, meaning each original cell is now 10^7 copies. Similarly, the second group is 1:10^5.\n\nSo, the expected number of cells with the mutation would depend on the probability of having a cell with the mutation and multiplying by the total number of cells in each group.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the mutated allele in the population.\n\nIn the first group, each cell has 10^7 copies, so the total number of phages in that group is N = (number of cells) * (10^7). But actually, since the phage concentration is proportional to the number of cells, we can model it as:\n\nNumber of phages = (number of cells) * (replication per cell)\n\nFor the first group, each cell has 10^7 phages, so the total phages are C * 10^7, where C is the number of cells in that group.\n\nSimilarly, in the second group, each cell has 10^5 phages, so the total phages are D * 10^5.\n\nBut the actual number observed is 4 and 40 plasmids, so:\n\nIn the first group: 4 = C * p * 10^7\n\nIn the second group: 40 = D * p * 10^5\n\nAssuming that the total number of cells in each group is the same (since they come from the same initial population and are diluted similarly?), but that might not necessarily be true. Alternatively, let's assume that the number of cells in each group is such that the number of plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequency and the dilution.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids is equal to the number of cells with the mutation multiplied by the number of phages per cell.\n\nSo, 4 = (p) * (number of cells in first group) * (10^7)\n\nAnd 40 = (p) * (number of cells in second group) * (10^5)\n\nIf the number of cells in each group is the same, say N, then:\n\n4 = N * p * 10^7\n\n40 = N * p * 10^5\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = (N * p * 10^5) / (N * p * 10^7)\n\n10 = 1/100\n\nWhich gives 10 = 1/100 \u2192 1000 = 1, which is impossible. So my assumption that the number of cells in each group is the same must be incorrect.\n\nInstead, the number of cells in each group depends on the dilution factor. Let\u2019s denote n as the number of cells in the first group (higher dilution) and m as the number of cells in the second group (lower dilution).\n\nThen, the number of phages in the first group is n * (10^7) * p = 4\n\nIn the second group, m * (10^5) * p = 40\n\nWe need to find p, the frequency of the mutation.\n\nAdditionally, the ratio of n/m relates to the dilution factors. Since the first group is 1:10^7 and the second is 1:10^5, the number of cells in the first group is 10^(7) times more than in the second group. Wait, actually, the dilution factor indicates how much of the original solution is used. So, a 1:10^7 dilution means that 1 part of the sample is mixed with 10^7 parts of the diluent. Therefore, the total volume is approximately 1 + 10^7 \u2248 10^7 parts. So, the concentration is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Thus, the number of cells in each group would be proportional to the dilution factor. Wait, no, actually, the number of cells remains the same unless the population density changes, which it doesn't here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of cells in each group is the same, but the phage concentration is different. Since the phage concentration is proportional to the dilution factor, the number of phages per cell is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nSo, for the first group (higher dilution, 1:10^7):\n\nEach cell has 10^7 phages.\n\nTotal phages = n * 10^7\n\nOf these, p fraction are mutated, so total mutated phages = n * 10^7 * p = 4\n\nSecond group (lower dilution, 1:10^5):\n\nEach cell has 10^5 phages.\n\nTotal phages = m * 10^5\n\n mutated phages = m * 10^5 * p = 40\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nn * 10^7 * p = 4 ...(1)\n\nm * 10^5 * p = 40 ...(2)\n\nWe can divide equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n(m * 10^5 * p) / (n * 10^7 * p) )= 40 / 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(m / n) * (10^5 / 10^7) = 10\n\n(m / n) * (1/100) = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nm / n = 1000\n\nSo, m = 1000 * n\n\nThis means that there are 1000 times as many cells in the second group as in the first group.\n\nSince the number of cells in each group is determined by the dilution, but assuming the original population is large enough, the ratio m/n = 1000 suggests that the second group has 1000 times more cells than the first group.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the dilution factor implies that each subsequent dilution adds more cells. So, starting with a certain number of cells, each dilution increases the count by a factor of 10^n, where n is the exponent in the dilution factor.\n\nFor example, a 1:10^7 dilution would mean adding 10^7 cells to an existing sample. Similarly, a 1:10^5 dilution would add 10^5 cells.\n\nGiven that, if the first group has n cells and the second group has m = 1000 * n cells, then the second group is 1000 times larger.\n\nNow, going back to the equations:\n\nFrom equation (1): n * 10^7 * p = 4 \u2192 p = 4 / (n * 10^7)\n\nFrom equation (2): m * 10^5 * p = 40 \u2192 substitute m = 1000n and p from above:\n\n1000n * 10^5 * (4 / (n * 10^7)) )= 40\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1000n) * 10^5 * 4 / (n * 10^7) = 40\n\nCancel n:\n\n1000 * 10^5 * 4 / 10^7 = 40\n\nCalculate exponents:\n\n10^5 / 10^7 = 10^-2\n\nSo,\n\n1000 * 10^-2 * 4 = 40\n\n1000 * 0.01 = 10\n\n10 * 4 = 40\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nSo, p = 4 / (n * 10^7). But we don't know n yet. However, since the ratio m/n = 1000, and knowing that the number of cells in each group is related to the dilution, we can express n in terms of the original number of cells.\n\nAssume initially there are N cells. After a 1:10^7 dilution, n = N * 10^7. Then, the next dilution (1:10^5) would take n and make m = n * 10^5 = N * 10^7 * 10^5 = N * 10^12. But this seems too high because m cannot be more than N.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dilutions. The first dilution is 1:10^7, which means taking 1 part of the sample and mixing it with 10^7 parts of diluent, so the total volume is approximately 10^7 + 1 \u2248 10^7. The concentration is 1/(10^7 +1) \u2248 10^{-7}.\n\nAfter diluting again to 1:10^5, the new total volume is 10^5 +1 \u2248 10^5. The concentration is now 1/(10^5 +1) \u2248 10^{-5}.\n\nTherefore, the number of cells in each group is proportional to the concentration. Initially, all cells had concentration c. After dilution to 1:10^7, the concentration becomes c / 10^7, so the number of cells becomes N * (c / 10^7) / c = N / 10^7. Similarly, after further dilution to 1:10^5, the concentration is c / 10^5, so the number of cells is N / 10^5.\n\nThus, n = N / 10^7\n\nm = N / 10^5\n\nSo, m = 100 * n\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier conclusion that m = 1000 * n? Wait, no, m = N / 10^5 = 100 * (N / 10^7) = 100n. So m = 100n, not 1000n.\n\nWait, I thought earlier that m = 1000n, but according to this, m = 100n. That contradicts what I thought before. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, initial number of cells: N\n\nAfter 1:10^7 dilution: n = N / 10^7\n\nAfter 1:10^5 dilution: m = n / 10^5 = N / (10^7 * 10^5) )= N / 10^{12}\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the number of cells can't exceed the original population.\n\nWait, perhaps the dilution factors are multiplicative. So, a 1:10^7 dilution reduces the concentration by a factor of 10^7, but the number of cells remains the same unless the population density decreases.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you dilute a sample, the number of living cells in a fixed volume decreases. So, for example, if you have a culture with N cells, and you dilute it to 1:10^7, the number of live cells in each pipette tip would decrease proportionally.\n\nSo, after a 1:10^7 dilution, the number of live cells per pipette is N / 10^7\n\nAfter a further 1:10^5 dilution, the number of live cells per pipette is (N / 10^7) / 10^5 = N / 10^{12}\n\nBut this can't be correct because you started with N cells and ended up with fewer than that, which is possible if the population density drops due to crowding.\n\nHowever, in practice, when you perform multiple dilutions, each time reducing the concentration by a factor of 10^n, the number of cells available to contribute to the phage load is reduced accordingly.\n\nSo, with the first dilution, n = N / 10^7\n\nWith the second dilution, m = n / 10^5 = N / (10^7 * 10^5) = N / 10^{12}\n\nBut this would imply that m is much smaller than n, which contradicts our earlier calculation where m = 100n. So, clearly, I'm misunderstanding something.\n\nPerhaps the way to think about it is that the number of cells contributing to the phage load is proportional to the dilution factor. Each dilution factor represents the reduction in the number of phages relative to the original concentration. Therefore, each subsequent dilution removes a portion of the phages.\n\nWait, but actually, the number of cells is the same across all dilutions, assuming the original population is large. Therefore, if you dilute once, the number of live phages per cell decreases by a factor of 10^7, but the number of phages per cell remains the same if the population density hasn't changed. Wait, no, the number of phages per cell remains constant until the phage concentration is diluted away.\n\nWait, perhaps the key is that the number of cells with the mutation is proportional to the square root of the number of phages. Because each cell can produce a limited number of phages, and the chance of duplication is based on the phage concentration.\n\nBut in this case, the mutation is already present in the phage, so the number of mutated cells is determined by the phage concentration.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck here. Maybe I should try using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to the linkage between two loci.\n\nThe coefficient of coincidence (COC) is defined as:\n\nC",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But strain K isn't affected, so maybe it's the lysogenic phage?\n\nThe experiment involves plates of strain B, each infected by two types of mutantphages. The result was a saturation divided into two halves. One half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B lawn, giving four pluses. The other half was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, resulting in four pluses as well.\n\nWait, if both halves are dilute, then the number of plasmid copies per cell would be lower for the higher dilution. So the first half has a lot more cells, but fewer phages, while the second half has fewer cells, so the same number of phages mean more clonal spreading.\n\nIn the case where the mutation is lethal (like the lysogenic phage), only cells with the mutation will survive and spread. If the mutation is non-lethal, both clones might replicate, leading to more clonal expansion. But in this case, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing lytic fission, it should cause lysogenic replication, meaning both strains might replicate, but maybe the lysogenic ones die or replicate elsewhere? Hmm, perhaps I'm mixing up things.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when a lysogenic phage infects bacteria, it integrates its DNA into the host genome, becomes part of the lysosome, and then replicates. This leads to increased replication but also can cause more efficient lysogeny. However, if the phage is only lysogenic, it should still replicate within the same strain without affecting the host's lysogeny.\n\nBut wait, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission; it's the opposite\u2014lytic fission means the phage fuses with the bacterial chromosome and replicates outside, causing the bacterium to lyse. So the lysogenic phage would lead to lysogenic replication, which is less efficient than lytic replication. Therefore, when you have a lysogenic phage, most offspring will be of the same type, so in a culture, you'd see more cells with the mutation and fewer without it.\n\nNow, looking at the experiment. When the two mutantphages infect strain B, the lysogenic phage (which is the one that affects strain B) dies off, while the lysogenic phage from the other type (non-lytic?) No, wait, the first mutant is \"mutant\" in the genomic region rII. Wait, the problem says T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. They can cause lytic or lysogenic fission.\n\nSo, the lysogenic phage would cause the lysogeny to occur, making the phage integrate into the host and replicate efficiently. But if the phage is non-lytic, it just integrates into the host but doesn't replicate outside, so it doesn't cause the lysogeny. Alternatively, the lysogenic phage is integrating, causing the lysogeny, but non-lytic phages don't do that.\n\nWait, but the phage carries a mutation in rII, which is associated with lysogenic fission. So, the lysogenic phage would cause the phage to integrate, leading to more efficient replication and more lysogeny.\n\nNow, when the phages infect strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something. Strain B may have been under selection against non-lytic phages, or perhaps they were exposed to phages that led to their death. So, strain B is resistant to non-lytic phages but susceptible to lysogenic ones.\n\nWhen both mutantphages are present, some of them are lysogenic and others are non-lytic. Wait, the description says \"mutant phage\", but it's unclear whether they're lytic or lysogenic. Wait, the problem states that the T_4 phages carry mutations in the genomic region called rII. These mutations could affect either lytic or lysogenic replication. Since the lysogenic phage causes the lysogeny, which is more efficient, I think these mutations are likely to affect lysogenic replication.\n\nSo, in the experiment, the two mutantphages are likely one that causes lysogenic fission (leads to lysogeny) and another that doesn't cause lysogenic fission (maybe non-lytic). Or vice versa.\n\nWhen both are present, the result is that half the colonies are divided into two groups: one half with higher dilution (more cells, fewer phages) and one half with lower dilution (fewer cells, more phages).\n\nPlated on strain B lawn, the first half (higher dilution) resulted in 4 plasmids, suggesting 4 cells with the mutation. Plated on strain K, the other half (lower dilution) resulted in 40 plasmids, meaning 40 cells with the mutation.\n\nWait, but actually, the numbers given are plasmid counts. So, if the mutation occurs, each cell with the mutation contributes one plasmid. So, 4 plasmids on strain B lawn would mean 4 cells with the mutation, and 40 plasmids on strain K would mean 40 cells with the mutation.\n\nNow, the total number of cells in each group is determined by the dilution factor. For the first group, it's 1:10^7, meaning each original cell is now 10^7 copies. Similarly, the second group is 1:10^5.\n\nSo, the expected number of cells with the mutation would depend on the probability of having a cell with the mutation and multiplying by the total number of cells in each group.\n\nLet\u2019s denote p as the frequency of the mutated allele in the population.\n\nIn the first group, each cell has 10^7 copies, so the total number of phages in that group is N = (number of cells) * (10^7). But actually, since the phage concentration is proportional to the number of cells, we can model it as:\n\nNumber of phages = (number of cells) * (replication per cell)\n\nFor the first group, each cell has 10^7 phages, so the total phages are C * 10^7, where C is the number of cells in that group.\n\nSimilarly, in the second group, each cell has 10^5 phages, so the total phages are D * 10^5.\n\nBut the actual number observed is 4 and 40 plasmids, so:\n\nIn the first group: 4 = C * p * 10^7\n\nIn the second group: 40 = D * p * 10^5\n\nAssuming that the total number of cells in each group is the same (since they come from the same initial population and are diluted similarly?), but that might not necessarily be true. Alternatively, let's assume that the number of cells in each group is such that the number of plasmids is proportional to the product of the frequency and the dilution.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plasmids is equal to the number of cells with the mutation multiplied by the number of phages per cell.\n\nSo, 4 = (p) * (number of cells in first group) * (10^7)\n\nAnd 40 = (p) * (number of cells in second group) * (10^5)\n\nIf the number of cells in each group is the same, say N, then:\n\n4 = N * p * 10^7\n\n40 = N * p * 10^5\n\nDividing the second equation by the first:\n\n40 / 4 = (N * p * 10^5) / (N * p * 10^7)\n\n10 = 1/100\n\nWhich gives 10 = 1/100 \u2192 1000 = 1, which is impossible. So my assumption that the number of cells in each group is the same must be incorrect.\n\nInstead, the number of cells in each group depends on the dilution factor. Let\u2019s denote n as the number of cells in the first group (higher dilution) and m as the number of cells in the second group (lower dilution).\n\nThen, the number of phages in the first group is n * (10^7) * p = 4\n\nIn the second group, m * (10^5) * p = 40\n\nWe need to find p, the frequency of the mutation.\n\nAdditionally, the ratio of n/m relates to the dilution factors. Since the first group is 1:10^7 and the second is 1:10^5, the number of cells in the first group is 10^(7) times more than in the second group. Wait, actually, the dilution factor indicates how much of the original solution is used. So, a 1:10^7 dilution means that 1 part of the sample is mixed with 10^7 parts of the diluent. Therefore, the total volume is approximately 1 + 10^7 \u2248 10^7 parts. So, the concentration is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. Thus, the number of cells in each group would be proportional to the dilution factor. Wait, no, actually, the number of cells remains the same unless the population density changes, which it doesn't here.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the number of cells in each group is the same, but the phage concentration is different. Since the phage concentration is proportional to the dilution factor, the number of phages per cell is inversely proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nSo, for the first group (higher dilution, 1:10^7):\n\nEach cell has 10^7 phages.\n\nTotal phages = n * 10^7\n\nOf these, p fraction are mutated, so total mutated phages = n * 10^7 * p = 4\n\nSecond group (lower dilution, 1:10^5):\n\nEach cell has 10^5 phages.\n\nTotal phages = m * 10^5\n\n mutated phages = m * 10^5 * p = 40\n\nSo, we have two equations:\n\nn * 10^7 * p = 4 ...(1)\n\nm * 10^5 * p = 40 ...(2)\n\nWe can divide equation (2) by equation (1):\n\n(m * 10^5 * p) / (n * 10^7 * p) )= 40 / 4\n\nSimplify:\n\n(m / n) * (10^5 / 10^7) = 10\n\n(m / n) * (1/100) = 10\n\nMultiply both sides by 100:\n\nm / n = 1000\n\nSo, m = 1000 * n\n\nThis means that there are 1000 times as many cells in the second group as in the first group.\n\nSince the number of cells in each group is determined by the dilution, but assuming the original population is large enough, the ratio m/n = 1000 suggests that the second group has 1000 times more cells than the first group.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the dilution factor implies that each subsequent dilution adds more cells. So, starting with a certain number of cells, each dilution increases the count by a factor of 10^n, where n is the exponent in the dilution factor.\n\nFor example, a 1:10^7 dilution would mean adding 10^7 cells to an existing sample. Similarly, a 1:10^5 dilution would add 10^5 cells.\n\nGiven that, if the first group has n cells and the second group has m = 1000 * n cells, then the second group is 1000 times larger.\n\nNow, going back to the equations:\n\nFrom equation (1): n * 10^7 * p = 4 \u2192 p = 4 / (n * 10^7)\n\nFrom equation (2): m * 10^5 * p = 40 \u2192 substitute m = 1000n and p from above:\n\n1000n * 10^5 * (4 / (n * 10^7)) )= 40\n\nSimplify:\n\n(1000n) * 10^5 * 4 / (n * 10^7) = 40\n\nCancel n:\n\n1000 * 10^5 * 4 / 10^7 = 40\n\nCalculate exponents:\n\n10^5 / 10^7 = 10^-2\n\nSo,\n\n1000 * 10^-2 * 4 = 40\n\n1000 * 0.01 = 10\n\n10 * 4 = 40\n\nYes, it checks out.\n\nSo, p = 4 / (n * 10^7). But we don't know n yet. However, since the ratio m/n = 1000, and knowing that the number of cells in each group is related to the dilution, we can express n in terms of the original number of cells.\n\nAssume initially there are N cells. After a 1:10^7 dilution, n = N * 10^7. Then, the next dilution (1:10^5) would take n and make m = n * 10^5 = N * 10^7 * 10^5 = N * 10^12. But this seems too high because m cannot be more than N.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the dilutions. The first dilution is 1:10^7, which means taking 1 part of the sample and mixing it with 10^7 parts of diluent, so the total volume is approximately 10^7 + 1 \u2248 10^7. The concentration is 1/(10^7 +1) \u2248 10^{-7}.\n\nAfter diluting again to 1:10^5, the new total volume is 10^5 +1 \u2248 10^5. The concentration is now 1/(10^5 +1) \u2248 10^{-5}.\n\nTherefore, the number of cells in each group is proportional to the concentration. Initially, all cells had concentration c. After dilution to 1:10^7, the concentration becomes c / 10^7, so the number of cells becomes N * (c / 10^7) / c = N / 10^7. Similarly, after further dilution to 1:10^5, the concentration is c / 10^5, so the number of cells is N / 10^5.\n\nThus, n = N / 10^7\n\nm = N / 10^5\n\nSo, m = 100 * n\n\nWhich aligns with our earlier conclusion that m = 1000 * n? Wait, no, m = N / 10^5 = 100 * (N / 10^7) = 100n. So m = 100n, not 1000n.\n\nWait, I thought earlier that m = 1000n, but according to this, m = 100n. That contradicts what I thought before. Let me double-check.\n\nActually, initial number of cells: N\n\nAfter 1:10^7 dilution: n = N / 10^7\n\nAfter 1:10^5 dilution: m = n / 10^5 = N / (10^7 * 10^5) )= N / 10^{12}\n\nWait, that can\u2019t be right because the number of cells can't exceed the original population.\n\nWait, perhaps the dilution factors are multiplicative. So, a 1:10^7 dilution reduces the concentration by a factor of 10^7, but the number of cells remains the same unless the population density decreases.\n\nWait, but in reality, when you dilute a sample, the number of living cells in a fixed volume decreases. So, for example, if you have a culture with N cells, and you dilute it to 1:10^7, the number of live cells in each pipette tip would decrease proportionally.\n\nSo, after a 1:10^7 dilution, the number of live cells per pipette is N / 10^7\n\nAfter a further 1:10^5 dilution, the number of live cells per pipette is (N / 10^7) / 10^5 = N / 10^{12}\n\nBut this can't be correct because you started with N cells and ended up with fewer than that, which is possible if the population density drops due to crowding.\n\nHowever, in practice, when you perform multiple dilutions, each time reducing the concentration by a factor of 10^n, the number of cells available to contribute to the phage load is reduced accordingly.\n\nSo, with the first dilution, n = N / 10^7\n\nWith the second dilution, m = n / 10^5 = N / (10^7 * 10^5) = N / 10^{12}\n\nBut this would imply that m is much smaller than n, which contradicts our earlier calculation where m = 100n.

The result is that the population is split into two halves: one half is diluted 1:10^7 (which means each plating has 1e7 cells), and the other half is diluted 1:10^5 (so fewer cells, 1e5 each).\n\nWhen the first half (diluted 1e7) is plated on strain B's lawn, four plaques appear. That suggests that the lysogenic phage might be present because in a normal situation, without recombination, you'd expect more splits or higher frequency of certain mutations. But wait, actually, if there's recombination, some phages would have parts from one mutation and others from another, leading to different outcomes.\n\nThe second half, dilated 1e5, is plated on strain K's lawn. Here, four plaques appeared. So, combining these two results gives us an idea about the distribution of the two mutations in the phages.\n\nLet me think about the expected results if there was no recombination. In such a case, all phages carrying either mutation would behave similarly. If a phage has a lysogenic mutation, it would cause lytic fission; otherwise, it wouldn't. However, since the phages are wild-type except for the lysogenic mutation, any interaction would lead to consistent behavior unless the mutations affect replication differently.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the issue arises because the two types of phages could potentially interact. For example, if a phage carries a lysogenic mutation (which makes it lytic) and another carries a recombination point, then their combinations might produce different effects than expected.\n\nBut according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, while the wild-type ones don't. So, the lysogenic phage should lyse strain B but not strain K. Now, when both types are present, how do they behave?\n\nIn the first half, with the lysogenic phage, you get four plaques on strain B. On strain K, the same phage doesn't cause issues, so why is there a difference? Maybe the presence of both phages leads to some interference or double mutant effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference in dilution affects the number of plasmids available or the efficiency of phage infection.\n\nWait, let me recall: in phage experiments, if two mutants are present, sometimes they can cause interference. For example, a lysogenic phage and a non-lysogenic phage might interfere, reducing the effective concentration of phage DNA. This would mean fewer plasmids, hence fewer splits or fewer plasmas on the lawn.\n\nBut in our experiment, the first half (diluted 1e7) is treated with the lysogenic phage, which should cause lytic fission, but in reality, the result is four plasmas on strain B. On the second half, the same phage isn't acting, so why is there a difference?\n\nAh, maybe the presence of both phages causes some interference. If both are present, even though one is lysogenic and the other is wild-type, they might interact in a way that reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis anyway. So maybe the interference is due to the presence of both phages interfering with each other before the lysogenic phage can act.\n\nAnother angle: in the first half, the lysogenic phage could cause multiple plasmid insertions, but the fact that only four are found suggests that not many did so. On the second half, with less dilution, maybe the phages are more likely to replicate and insert into the same sites, increasing the likelihood of double mutants.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in dilution (1e7 vs 1e5) might affect the number of plasmids. Dilution affects the probability of a phage successfully infecting a bacterium. With a lower dilution (1e5), the chance of a phage successfully infecting a bacterium is lower, meaning fewer bacteria will take up the phage plasmid. This could lead to different numbers of interactions depending on whether the phage is lysogenic or non-lysogenic.\n\nWait, but the first half is treated with the lysogenic phage, which should lyse strain B, but instead, four plasmas are found. That seems low. If the lysogenic phage is present, it should cause many more plasmas. But here, it's only four. On the other hand, the second half with less dilution (1e5) shows four plasmas on strain K, which doesn't make sense because if the lysogenic phage isn't active, why would strain K show any plasmas?\n\nHmm, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Let me read again:\n\n\"A plate of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nWait, so the first half is treated with the lysogenic phage (since it's mixed with mutantphages) and plated on strain B's lawn. The second half is treated with the non-lysogenic phage (the other type) and plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nNow, in the first half (lytic phage), four plasmas were found on strain B. On the second half (non-lysogenic phage), four plasmas were found on strain K.\n\nThis suggests that when the lysogenic phage is present, it causes four plasmas on strain B, indicating that some plasmids were inserted. On the other hand, the non-lysogenic phage didn't cause any plasmas on strain K, implying that it didn't find any sites to insert its DNA.\n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage causes four plasmas on strain B, what does that tell us about the recombination points?\n\nEach mutation in the phage's gene causes a recombination point. In the T_4 genome, the lysogenic phage typically has a recombination site near the top, say R1. The non-lysogenic phage has none. When both are present, the phage's genome becomes a mosaic, with regions from both parents.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage causes four plasmas on strain B, that suggests that four of the phage copies have been integrated into the E. coli chromosome through the recombination site. Each integration event creates a new plasmid, and each time a copy inserts into the same site, it increases the likelihood of interference or causes more splits.\n\nWait, but actually, in a typical experiment, if two phages are mixed, the total number of plasmids on the lawn depends on the number of unique recombination points. Each recombination point allows for the insertion of a new plasmid.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage has a recombination point, and the non-lysogenic also has one, but they're different, then the total number of unique plasmids would depend on how much each contributes.\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage caused four plasmas on strain B. On the non-lytic phage, no plasmas on strain K. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the non-lytic phage shouldn't cause any plasmids, as it doesn't have a recombination point. So why is there a difference?\n\nPerhaps the key lies in the number of plasmids per cell. When the lysogenic phage is present, each cell may have multiple plasmids due to interference. Interference occurs when multiple phages try to integrate into the same site, leading to some deletions or reduced activity.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage integrates into multiple sites, each insertion could create a new plasmid. But if the non-lytic phage doesn't integrate, maybe the lysogenic phage is more efficient at causing insertions.\n\nWait, but in the lysogenic phage treatment, the result was four plasmas on strain B. If the lysogenic phage has a recombination point, each insertion would create a new plasmid. If the phage is diploid, each copy might have a chance to insert, but only once per insertion.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage causes four plasmas on strain B, that suggests that four insertions occurred, possibly due to each cell having four unique sites created by the recombination.\n\nWait, but each insertion would create a new plasmid. So four insertions would mean four new plasmids. But each cell can only have so many plasmids. If strain B has a lot of cells, each with four unique plasmids, that would explain four plasmas appearing on the lawn.\n\nOn the other hand, the non-lytic phage doesn't have a recombination site, so it doesn't cause any plasmid insertion. Thus, when plated on strain K, which presumably doesn't have the mutation for lysogenic fission, it shouldn't cause any issues. But the result was four plasmas on strain K, which contradicts this initial thought.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Unless I'm missing something here.\n\nMaybe the non-lytic phage actually does cause some plasmid insertion. If strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, but the phage still integrates into the E. coli chromosome, it would cause disruption, leading to reduced fitness and possibly more splits or plasmid loss. But the problem states that the other half is plated on a lawn of strain K, expecting no issues. Yet, four plasmas appeared on strain K.\n\nThis discrepancy suggests that my initial assumption about the role of the non-lytic phage might be incorrect. Perhaps the non-lytic phage does cause some plasmid insertion, but the mutation on strain K somehow interferes with that process. Or perhaps the recombination between the two mutantphages themselves plays a role.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"recombination between the two mutations in this region of the T_4 genome.\" Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two different locations in the genome. In phage genetics, this often involves disrupting the phage's ability to replicate by inserting its own sequence into the host's genome.\n\nIn this case, the two mutantphages carry different mutations: lysogenic (which causes lytic fission) and non-lytic (which doesn't). These two mutations could disrupt each other's replication, leading to interference. This is known as the \"double mutant\" phenomenon, where the combination of two mutations leads to reduced or no activity compared to individual mutations.\n\nTo quantify recombination, we can use the formula involving the fractions of each mutation. Let\u2019s denote p as the fraction of cells with the lysogenic phage, and q as the fraction with the non-lyciclic phage. Since the two mutations are mutually exclusive (a cell can\u2019t carry both), p + q = 1.\n\nIn a double mutant assay, the expected number of double mutants (both mutations occurring) would be pq. However, in reality, due to interference, the observed number of double mutants is less than expected.\n\nThe formula to calculate the coefficient of coincidence (m) is m = observed double mutants / expected double mutants. If m is close to zero, it indicates complete interference.\n\nBut in our case, perhaps the ratio of plasmids detected can help determine the degree of recombination.\n\nWait, going back to the results: when the lysogenic phage is present, four plasmids are found on strain B. When the non-lytic phage is present, four plasmids are found on strain K. If there were no recombination, the lysogenic phage would cause a certain number of plasmids, and the non-lyciclic would cause another.\n\nBut the observed data suggests that the lysogenic phage is causing four plasmids, while the non-lyciclic is causing none. But the non-lyciclic phage isn't supposed to cause any plasmids, so why is strain K showing four plasmas? Maybe the phages are being washed away, or the strains are being selected against.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is not acting correctly, or vice versa.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider the ratio of plasmids detected on each strain. If there was no recombination, the lysogenic phage would cause a certain number of plasmids on strain B, and the non-lyciclic phage would cause none on strain K. However, in the experiment, the non-lyciclic phage caused plasmids on strain K, which shouldn't happen if there's no recombination.\n\nBut the actual observation is that on strain K, four plasmids are found, suggesting that despite no recombination, the non-lyciclic phage is causing plasmids. This suggests that the non-lyciclic phage must have a recombination point, creating plasmids that integrate into strain K's genome.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the two mutantphages are carrying mutations in the T_4 genome. So perhaps the non-lyciclic phage has a recombination point, allowing it to insert into the E. coli chromosome, causing disruption and plasmid formation.\n\nIf that's the case, the presence of both phages would cause some interference, leading to fewer plasmids than expected. But according to the results, four plasmids are found on strain K, which is unexpected if the non-lyciclic phage doesn't have a recombination site.\n\nThis confusion suggests that I need to apply the formula for recombinant frequency or the coefficient of coincidence.\n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage caused four plasmids on strain B, and the non-lyciclic phage caused four plasmids on strain K, the ratio of plasmids on each strain can indicate the level of recombination.\n\nThe formula for the coefficient of coincidence (m) is m = observed double mutants / expected double mutants. But in our case, the expected double mutants would be pq, where p is the proportion of cells with lysogenic phage and q with non-lyciclic.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact values of p and q, we can relate the plasmid counts to estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage causes four plasmids on strain B, and the non-lyciclic causes four on strain K, perhaps each plasmid corresponds to a unique recombination site. Therefore, the presence of four plasmids suggests that four different sites were integrated, indicating a high level of recombination.\n\nBut how does this translate into a recombination frequency?\n\nRecombination frequency (rf) is usually expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of offspring that carry a particular crossover. It is calculated using the formula rf = (number of crossovers) \u00d7 (1/2^n), where n is the number of chromosomes involved. However, in phage experiments, the concept is slightly different because it's about the number of unique plasmids or events.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the two mutantphages are interacting, the combined effect can be modeled using the formula for interference, which relates the observed number of double mutants to the expected number under independence.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nm = (observed double mutants) / (expected double mutants)\n\nExpected double mutants = p * q\n\nObserved = ?\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage resulted in four plasmids on strain B, and the non-lyciclic caused four on strain K. If the non-lyciclic phage had a recombination site, it would have inserted into the host's chromosome, creating new plasmids. However, since the strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, why does it pick up plasmids from the non-lyciclic phage?\n\nThis suggests that the non-lyciclic phage is acting as a plasmid source. It must have a recombination site, so when it integrates into the E. coli chromosome, it disrupts the host's gene, leading to reduced fitness or increased plasmid loss. As a result, the plasmids from the non-lyciclic phage survive and cause plasmid loss on strain K.\n\nTherefore, the presence of both phages leads to some interference, resulting in fewer plasmids than expected if there was no recombination. The observed number of plasmids on each strain can help estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose that the lysogenic phage has a recombination point (R1), and the non-lyciclic phage has another (R2). The combined effect would lead to some interference, affecting the number of plasmids detected.\n\nBut calculating the exact recombination frequency requires knowing the probabilities of each phage integrating and the degree of interference. Without specific data on these factors, we can approximate based on the plasmid counts.\n\nIf four plasmids are found on strain B when the lysogenic phage is present, and four on strain K when the non-lyciclic is present, we can infer that the lysogenic phage is causing significant plasmid loss, which might suggest that it's integrating into multiple sites, leading to interference.\n\nHowever, given the options provided (from 0.01% to 0.5%), and considering that the number of plasmids detected (four) is quite high relative to the expected number, it suggests a relatively high level of recombination.\n\nTypically, a recombination frequency of around 5% (option G) would lead to a moderate number of plasmids, whereas lower frequencies (like 1%) would result in fewer plasmids. Given that four plasmids on each strain correspond to a substantial number, perhaps closer to 5%.\n\nBut I need to cross-check this reasoning with the possible answers.

A recombination frequency of 5% (option G) would imply a moderate number of plasmids, which aligns with the observed data.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't have the mutation causing lysogenic fission, both phages work normally, so no issues there.\n\nSo, we have a plate where E. coli strain B is infected by these two types of mutantphages at the same time. The result is that the population is split into two halves: one half is diluted 1:10^7 (which means each plating has 1e7 cells), and the other half is diluted 1:10^5 (so fewer cells, 1e5 each).\n\nWhen the first half (diluted 1e7) is plated on strain B's lawn, four plaques appear. That suggests that the lysogenic phage might be present because in a normal situation, without recombination, you'd expect more splits or higher frequency of certain mutations. But wait, actually, if there's recombination, some phages would have parts from one mutation and others from another, leading to different outcomes.\n\nThe second half, dilated 1e5, is plated on strain K's lawn. Here, four plaques appeared. So, combining these two results gives us an idea about the distribution of the two mutations in the phages.\n\nLet me think about the expected results if there was no recombination. In such a case, all phages carrying either mutation would behave similarly. If a phage has a lysogenic mutation, it would cause lytic fission; otherwise, it wouldn't. However, since the phages are wild-type except for the lysogenic mutation, any interaction would lead to consistent behavior unless the mutations affect replication differently.\n\nWait, actually, maybe the issue arises because the two types of phages could potentially interact. For example, if a phage carries a lysogenic mutation (which makes it lytic) and another carries a recombination point, then their combinations might produce different effects than expected.\n\nBut according to the problem, only the lysogenic phage affects strain B, while the wild-type ones don't. So, the lysogenic phage should lyse strain B but not strain K. Now, when both types are present, how do they behave?\n\nIn the first half, with the lysogenic phage, you get four plaques on strain B. On strain K, the same phage doesn't cause issues, so why is there a difference? Maybe the presence of both phages leads to some interference or double mutant effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference in dilution affects the number of plasmids available or the efficiency of phage infection.\n\nWait, let me recall: in phage experiments, if two mutants are present, sometimes they can cause interference. For example, a lysogenic phage and a non-lysogenic phage might interfere, reducing the effective concentration of phage DNA. This would mean fewer plasmids, hence fewer splits or fewer plasmas on the lawn.\n\nBut in our experiment, the first half (diluted 1e7) is treated with the lysogenic phage, which should cause lytic fission, but in reality, the result is four plasmas on strain B. On the second half, the same phage isn't acting, so why is there a difference?\n\nAh, maybe the presence of both phages causes some interference. If both are present, even though one is lysogenic and the other is wild-type, they might interact in a way that reduces the effectiveness of the lysogenic phage.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis anyway. So maybe the interference is due to the presence of both phages interfering with each other before the lysogenic phage can act.\n\nAnother angle: in the first half, the lysogenic phage could cause multiple plasmid insertions, but the fact that only four are found suggests that not many did so. On the second half, with less dilution, maybe the phages are more likely to replicate and insert into the same sites, increasing the likelihood of double mutants.\n\nAlternatively, the difference in dilution (1e7 vs 1e5) might affect the number of plasmids. Dilution affects the probability of a phage successfully infecting a bacterium. With a lower dilution (1e5), the chance of a phage successfully infecting a bacterium is lower, meaning fewer bacteria will take up the phage plasmid. This could lead to different numbers of interactions depending on whether the phage is lysogenic or non-lysogenic.\n\nWait, but the first half is treated with the lysogenic phage, which should lyse strain B, but instead, four plasmas are found.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.",

    "rollout": " But when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, which doesn't have lysogenic activity, it doesn't cause any issues. So the experiment is about seeing how these mutations interact within each strain.\n\nThe plate has both types of mutantphages. Half the bacteria are treated with a high concentration of the lysogenic phage (since it's more likely to lyse), and half with a low concentration (so less chance of causing an issue). After dilution, some are plated on strain B's lawn and others on strain K's lawn. The results show 40 pluses on B and 4 on K.\n\nFrom what I remember, when you do a double cross (like here, mixing different concentrations), the number of recombinant colonies indicates the likelihood of recombination. Each time you get a recombinant colony, it suggests a crossover event during recombination. Since the parent strains don't recombine, the offspring should be either parent type or another non-parent if there's no recombination.\n\nIn a typical double cross with no recombination, you'd expect around 25% of the colonies from the high-dilution plate to come from the parent strain, 25% from the other parent, and 50% from recombinants. But since we're getting more than 25% recombinants, maybe there's some recombination happening.\n\nWait, let me think again. In this case, the high-dilution plate (which means fewer cells survive) shows more recombinant colonies. If there were complete recombination, all the recombinant colonies would come from the parental strain. But in reality, with some recombination, you'd see a certain percentage.\n\nLooking at the numbers: 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. That's a ratio of 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. Wait, but that seems like a lot. Alternatively, perhaps it's 40 out of 44 total colonies? Because 40 plus 4 is 44. Hmm, that makes sense if there are multiple possible sources.\n\nBut wait, in a normal case without recombination, the expected ratio would be 25% each for the parents and 50% for recombinants. But here, it's higher, meaning more recombination. However, the numbers might not directly translate because the dilutions affect the counts.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high-dilution plate has half the bacteria, and the low-dilution plate has a quarter. The high-dilution plate showing 40 pluses and 4 recombinants\u2014maybe that's actually the sum of both parent strains' contributions.\n\nIf there was no recombination, you'd expect 25% from each parent and 50% from each recombinant strain. But with some recombination, the numbers change. So if the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses and 4 rec, and assuming that the plasmid DNA comes equally from both parents, then the proportion of recombinants would be 4/(4+4)=50%. But that's just for the high-dilution plate.\n\nHowever, looking back, the problem states that the plate is split into two halves: one with high dilution (1/10^7) and one with lower dilution (1/10^5). Then those are plated onto separate lawns of strain B and K respectively. The results are 40 pluses on B and 4 on K.\n\nSo the high-dilution plate has 44 colonies: 40 pluses and 4 rec. The low-dilution plate has 1/10^5 dilution, which is even more concentrated, so fewer plasmids per colony. The number of plasmids per colony is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So 1/10^5 would mean each colony has 10^5 plasmids on average.\n\nBut regardless of the exact number, the key is that the high-dilution plate shows a significant number of recombinant colonies, indicating that recombination is occurring. To quantify the recombination frequency (RF), we can use the formula:\n\nRF = (number of recombinants + number of negative recombinants - number of double crossovers)/total number of colonies\n\nAssuming negligible double crossovers, RF \u2248 (R + NR)/T\n\nWhere R is recombinants, NR is negative recombinants, and T is total.\n\nIn our case, if the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses and 4 rec, but considering that some of these could be from the same original plasmid (parental) or different ones (recombinants), we need to adjust.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to calculate the expected number under complete recombination and compare it to what's observed. For each test tube, the expected number of recombinant colonies can be calculated using the formula:\n\nExpected recombinant = (number of positive colonies)^2 / total colonies\n\nThis assumes that each mutation occurs independently and that only one mutation contributes to the recombinant.\n\nGiven that, let's say on the high-dilution plate, there are 40 pluses and 4 rec. Total colonies = 44.\n\nExpected recombinant = (40)^2 / 44 \u2248 1600 / 44 \u2248 36.36\n\nWhich is almost equal to the actual recombinant count, suggesting high recombination.\n\nBut to find the RF, we can also consider that the probability of recombination is related to the square of the frequency of each mutation. But since the mutations are on the T4 phage, which usually have two copies (T4a and T4b), the RF would relate to the frequency of each allele.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler way is to calculate the expected RF based on the ratio of plasmids. If the plasmids carry two mutations, the probability of recombination is the product of their frequencies.\n\nLet\u2019s denote f as the frequency of each mutation. Then RF = 4f(1-f).\n\nBut in our case, we have 40 pluses and 4 rec. Assuming that the plasmids are equally distributed among the colonies, the frequency of each mutation would be 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%.\n\nUsing RF = 4f(1-f), substituting f=0.909:\n\nRF \u2248 4 * 0.909 * (1-0.909) \u2248 4 * 0.909 * 0.091 \u2248 4 * 0.0828 \u2248 0.331 or 33.1%\n\nThat's over 33%, which isn't one of the options provided. Hmm, maybe my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated differently. Another approach is to consider the number of recombinant plasmids versus the total plasmids. On the high-dilution plate, each colony has 10^5 plasmids on average. Each plasmid carries two mutations (one from each phage), but in this case, each phage contributes one mutation. Wait, no\u2014the phages carry mutations in the genomic region. So each phage carries one mutation.\n\nEach colony has a certain number of mutated phages. The high-dilution plate has 40 pluses (mutated phages) and 4 rec (non-mutated phages). The low-dilution plate has fewer plasmids, but the number of plasmids per colony is much higher due to the dilution effect.\n\nTo calculate RF, we can take the number of recombinant plasmids (4) multiplied by the number of negative plasmids (the other colonies minus the rec). But this might complicate things.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps we should focus on the fact that the high-dilution plate had a higher number of recombinant colonies compared to the low-dilution plate. The low-dilution plate is more concentrated, so the plasmids per colony are more numerous, making the detection easier.\n\nIn the high-dilution plate, the ratio of plasmids carrying the mutation to those without is 40:4 = 10:1. This suggests that the mutation rate is high, possibly leading to significant recombination.\n\nBut going back to the initial thought, if RF is approximately 33%, which is close to option C (1.5%) or F (0.3%). But neither matches exactly.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try again.\n\nIf RF = 4f(1-f), and we have f \u2248 0.909 (from 40/44), then RF \u2248 4*0.909*(0.091) \u2248 0.331, as before.\n\nHmm, none of the options match 0.33%. Maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly.\n\nAlternative method: Recombination frequency can also be estimated by the formula RF = (R + 1)/(T + 1), where R is recombinant colonies and T is total. But I'm not sure about that.\n\nWait, another approach is to realize that if there's complete recombination, all plasmids would be recombinant. But in reality, some would still be parentals. However, given that we saw some recombinant colonies, it suggests partial recombination.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. The high-dilution plate is used to determine whether the mutations are from the same phage or different. If there's no recombination, you would expect similar numbers across both plates. Here, the high-dilution plate has more recombinants, while the low-dilution plate has fewer (only 4 on K, but 40 on B?), which contradicts the idea of recombination because the phages are from different origins.\n\nWait, no. Both plates are treating the phages separately. The high-dilution plate treats them individually, while the low-dilution plate treats them together. So in the high-dilution plate, the phages are from different strains, so recombination shouldn't occur between them. Therefore, all recombinants should come from the same strain. Hence, the high-dilution plate should have a similar distribution as the low-dilution plate, except for recombinants.\n\nBut according to the results, the high-dilution plate has more recombinants than the low-dilution plate. That suggests that recombination occurred between the two strains, but that shouldn't happen because the phages are from different strains.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. If the phages are from different strains, they shouldn't undergo recombination upon treatment with each other. Therefore, why are there more recombinant colonies on the high-dilution plate?\n\nMaybe the high-dilution plate refers to the situation where the phages are treated with each other (e.g., both phages are present on the same lawn). So, when you mix two sets of phages from different strains, you can observe recombination between them. That's a common experiment to detect chromosomal translocations or regions of recombination.\n\nAh, okay, that makes more sense. So the high-dilution plate is where you mix the two strains' phages, allowing for recombination between them. The low-dilution plate is where you treat each strain separately, preventing recombination. Therefore, the high-dilution plate shows recombinant colonies, while the low-dilution plate doesn't.\n\nIn that case, the high-dilution plate shows 40 pluses and 4 rec. But wait, the high-dilution plate is supposed to show only the recombinants because no recombination happened between the two strains. So why are there 40 pluses and 4 rec? That doesn't make sense unless recombination did occur, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the high-dilution plate includes both strains, allowing for recombination, and the low-dilution plate includes only one strain, preventing recombination. Thus, the high-dilution plate should have fewer recombinant colonies, and the low-dilution plate should have more parental colonies.\n\nBut according to the data, the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses and 4 rec, totaling 44. The low-dilution plate has 40 pluses on B and 4 on K, totaling 44 as well. So the counts are the same.\n\nWait, but if the high-dilution plate allows recombination, then the number of recombinant colonies should be higher than the low-dilution plate, assuming the same number of plasmids per colony. But here, both plates have the same total colonies (44 each), but the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses, which is higher than the low-dilution plate's 4 pluses.\n\nThis suggests that recombination occurred, but the number of recombinants increased when combining the two strains. That doesn't align with expectations because recombination should reduce the number of recombinants when combining two independent strains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the high-dilution plate is actually measuring the number of recombinants arising from a mixture of two strains, whereas the low-dilution plate measures recombinants within a single strain. If there's recombination between the two strains, the high-dilution plate should have more recombinants than the low-dilution plate, but in this case, it's the opposite.\n\nThis confusion leads me to reconsider my approach. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that if there's recombination between the two strains, the high-dilution plate should show fewer recombinants compared to the low-dilution plate. But in our case, it's the opposite. Therefore, there must be no recombination, and the high-dilution plate should have fewer recombinants than the low-dilution plate.\n\nBut the data says the high-dilution plate has more recombinants. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that there's no recombination, and the observed increase in recombinants is due to a miscalculation or misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the ability to interpret the results correctly. Given that the high-dilution plate has more recombinants, it suggests that recombination occurred, hence the presence of recombinant colonies implies some level of recombination.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggested a high RF of ~33%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating RF. Let's try again.\n\nIf the number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the total is 44, then the fraction of recombinants is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. If this fraction represents the recombination frequency, then RF \u2248 9.09%. But that's too high and not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated differently. Suppose that each mutation has a frequency of f, then RF = 4f(1-f). If f = 0.1 (10%), then RF = 4*0.1*0.9 = 0.36 or 36%, which is closer to option G (0.5%).\n\nBut the observed RF is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as the number of recombinants divided by the number of potential recombinants. For example, if each colony can have two mutations, the maximum number of recombinants per colony is 1 (if one mutation is from each phage). So, the RF would be the number of recombinants divided by the number of such potential recombinants.\n\nIn the high-dilution plate, there are 40 pluses, meaning 40 recombinant potential mutations. The total number of potential mutations is 40 (pluses) + 4 (recombinants) = 44. So RF = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%.\n\nBut again, this is not matching the answer choices.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to assume that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio of recombinant to parent colonies. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinant colonies increases with the square of the number of recombinants per individual. So if there are r recombinants per individual, then RF = (r^2)/(n^2), where n is the total number of individuals.\n\nHere, r = 40 pluses, n = 44. So RF = (40)^2/(44)^2 \u2248 1600/1936 \u2248 0.826 or 82.6%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because RF cannot exceed 100%, so perhaps the correct formula is RF = (r + 1)/(n + 1), which would give (40 + 1)/(44 + 1) \u2248 0.909, but that's still not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the correct calculation is RF = (r)/(n). So 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at the answer options again: A. 1% up to J. 0.05%, with H being 0.5% and G 0.1%. The highest given is 5% (option F), and the lowest is 0.1% (option J).\n\nMy previous calculation gave around 33% (option C: 1.5%) or F: 0.3%. But that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant colonies equals the square of the frequency of each mutation. If f is the frequency of each mutation, then RF = 4f(1-f). If f is 0.05 (5%), then RF = 4*0.05*0.95 = 0.19 or 19%, which is higher than any given option.\n\nAlternatively, if f is 0.1 (10%), RF = 4*0.1*0.9 = 0.36 or 36%, which is higher than the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids). But in the high-dilution plate, each colony has 10^5 plasmids, so the number of plasmids per colony is much larger than the number of plasmids detected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total number of plasmids is 40 + 4 = 44. So RF = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%. Again, not matching.\n\nWait,",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, which doesn't have lysogenic activity, it doesn't cause any issues. So the experiment is about seeing how these mutations interact within each strain.\n\nThe plate has both types of mutantphages. Half the bacteria are treated with a high concentration of the lysogenic phage (since it's more likely to lyse), and half with a low concentration (so less chance of causing an issue).

However, given that we saw some recombinant colonies, it suggests partial recombination.\n\nBut looking at the numbers, 40 pluses on B and 4 on K. The high-dilution plate is used to determine whether the mutations are from the same phage or different. If there's no recombination, you would expect similar numbers across both plates.

That doesn't make sense unless recombination did occur, which contradicts the expectation.\n\nTherefore, perhaps the correct interpretation is that the high-dilution plate includes both strains, allowing for recombination, and the low-dilution plate includes only one strain, preventing recombination. Thus, the high-dilution plate should have fewer recombinant colonies, and the low-dilution plate should have more parental colonies.\n\nBut according to the data, the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses and 4 rec, totaling 44. The low-dilution plate has 40 pluses on B and 4 on K, totaling 44 as well. So the counts are the same.\n\nWait, but if the high-dilution plate allows recombination, then the number of recombinant colonies should be higher than the low-dilution plate, assuming the same number of plasmids per colony. But here, both plates have the same total colonies (44 each), but the high-dilution plate has 40 pluses, which is higher than the low-dilution plate's 4 pluses.\n\nThis suggests that recombination occurred, but the number of recombinants increased when combining the two strains. That doesn't align with expectations because recombination should reduce the number of recombinants when combining two independent strains.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the high-dilution plate is actually measuring the number of recombinants arising from a mixture of two strains, whereas the low-dilution plate measures recombinants within a single strain. If there's recombination between the two strains, the high-dilution plate should have more recombinants than the low-dilution plate, but in this case, it's the opposite.\n\nThis confusion leads me to reconsider my approach. Perhaps the correct way is to recognize that if there's recombination between the two strains, the high-dilution plate should show fewer recombinants compared to the low-dilution plate. But in our case, it's the opposite. Therefore, there must be no recombination, and the high-dilution plate should have fewer recombinants than the low-dilution plate.\n\nBut the data says the high-dilution plate has more recombinants. So perhaps the correct conclusion is that there's no recombination, and the observed increase in recombinants is due to a miscalculation or misinterpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing the ability to interpret the results correctly. Given that the high-dilution plate has more recombinants, it suggests that recombination occurred, hence the presence of recombinant colonies implies some level of recombination.\n\nBut earlier calculations suggested a high RF of ~33%, which isn't one of the options. So perhaps I made a mistake in calculating RF. Let's try again.\n\nIf the number of recombinant colonies is 4, and the total is 44, then the fraction of recombinants is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. If this fraction represents the recombination frequency, then RF \u2248 9.09%. But that's too high and not among the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated differently. Suppose that each mutation has a frequency of f, then RF = 4f(1-f). If f = 0.1 (10%), then RF = 4*0.1*0.9 = 0.36 or 36%, which is closer to option G (0.5%).\n\nBut the observed RF is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which is much higher.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the RF is calculated as the number of recombinants divided by the number of potential recombinants. For example, if each colony can have two mutations, the maximum number of recombinants per colony is 1 (if one mutation is from each phage). So, the RF would be the number of recombinants divided by the number of such potential recombinants.\n\nIn the high-dilution plate, there are 40 pluses, meaning 40 recombinant potential mutations. The total number of potential mutations is 40 (pluses) + 4 (recombinants) = 44. So RF = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%.\n\nBut again, this is not matching the answer choices.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to assume that the recombination frequency is the square root of the ratio of recombinant to parent colonies. But I'm not sure.\n\nAnother angle: The number of recombinant colonies increases with the square of the number of recombinants per individual. So if there are r recombinants per individual, then RF = (r^2)/(n^2), where n is the total number of individuals.\n\nHere, r = 40 pluses, n = 44. So RF = (40)^2/(44)^2 \u2248 1600/1936 \u2248 0.826 or 82.6%. Again, not matching the options.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because RF cannot exceed 100%, so perhaps the correct formula is RF = (r + 1)/(n + 1), which would give (40 + 1)/(44 + 1) \u2248 0.909, but that's still not an option.\n\nWait, maybe the correct calculation is RF = (r)/(n). So 40/44 \u2248 0.909 or 90.9%. Still not matching.\n\nI'm stuck. Let me look at the answer options again: A. 1% up to J. 0.05%, with H being 0.5% and G 0.1%. The highest given is 5% (option F), and the lowest is 0.1% (option J).\n\nMy previous calculation gave around 33% (option C: 1.5%) or F: 0.3%. But that's not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinant colonies equals the square of the frequency of each mutation. If f is the frequency of each mutation, then RF = 4f(1-f). If f is 0.05 (5%), then RF = 4*0.05*0.95 = 0.19 or 19%, which is higher than any given option.\n\nAlternatively, if f is 0.1 (10%), RF = 4*0.1*0.9 = 0.36 or 36%, which is higher than the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is RF = (number of recombinant plasmids) / (total plasmids). But in the high-dilution plate, each colony has 10^5 plasmids, so the number of plasmids per colony is much larger than the number of plasmids detected.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant plasmids is 4, and the total number of plasmids is 40 + 4 = 44. So RF = 4/44 \u2248 0.0909 or 9.09%. Again, not matching.\n\nWait,",

The results show that half of them are saturated and then diluted 1:10^7, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After plating, there were 4 plaques on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles or mutations within the same gene locus. In phages, especially T_4, recombination would mean that the two mutations interact. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might become more efficient at lysing cells because it's better at integrating into the DNA.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurs. The number of plasmids (or copies) each strain has affects the likelihood of recombination. Normally, without recombination, all lysogenic phages replicate independently. But if some recombine, their replication rates change. \n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the result was 40 plasmids on B. On the second dilution (1:10^5), there were 4 plasmas on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a higher replication rate compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, I think we use the formula: Recombination Frequency = ((Number of Plasmids in Dilution A) - (Number of Plasmids in Dilution B)) / (Total Number of Plasmids in Dilution A). \n\nPlasmids in Dilution A: 40  \nPlasmids in Dilution B: 4  \nTotal: 40 + 4 = 44  \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach it differently. If there's complete independence, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the dilutions. Alternatively, the ratio of plasmids could indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nAnother way is using the ratio of plasmid numbers. If the recombination frequency is 'f,' then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is f. So, the number of plasmids in dilution A is (1 - f)*N + f*M, where N is normal and M is mutated. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nLet me try another approach. The difference in plasmid counts between the two dilutions could indicate the recombination. For example, if f is the recombination fraction, then the expected plasmid count in the first dilution would be (1 - f)*normal + f*mutated. But I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler method is to consider that the recombination frequency can be estimated as (plasmids in dilution A - plasmids in dilution B) / total plasmids in dilution A. That gives (40 - 4)/44 \u2248 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. That seems high. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from strain B would integrate with those from strain K, leading to increased efficiency. Since K lacks the mutation, its lysogenic phage shouldn't integrate. So, the presence of more plasmids in dilution A suggests that some recombination occurred. \n\nIf I assume that the recombination frequency is the proportion of times a phage from B integrates with K's lysogenic phage. So, the observed plasmids in dilution A are due to both non-recombined (from B carrying K's phage) and recombined (both have mutations).\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\n- Total plasmids in dilution A: 40\n- Total plasmids in dilution B: 4\n- Plasmids in dilution A that come from B without recombination: x\n- Plasmids in dilution A that come from B with recombination: y\n- Similarly for dilution B: z and w\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Instead, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio of plasmids between the two dilutions to estimate recombination frequency. \n\nThe increase from 4 to 40 plasmids over two dilutions suggests that recombination happened significantly. Using the formula:\n\nRecomb freq = (plasmids_A - plasmids_B) / (plasmids_A)\n\n= (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 90%\n\nThat seems too high, but given the data, it's possible. However, looking back, I realize that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from B should integrate with K's lysogenic phage, meaning that any plasmids in the A-dilution should come from both sources. So, the actual number of new plasmids introduced by recombination would depend on the existing population.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula might involve the sum of plasmids from both strains. Maybe the number of new plasmids formed due to recombination is (plasmids_A + plasmids_B) * f, where f is the fraction of new plasmids. Then, solving for f:\n\nplasmids_A = plasmids_B + (plasmids_A + plasmids_B) * f  \n40 = 4 + (40 + 4) * f  \n40 - 4 = 44f  \n36 = 44f  \nf \u2248 0.818, which is about 81.8%.\n\nThis still indicates a high recombination frequency, around 82%, which isn't among the options provided. The options go down to 0.02%, which is way lower. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the plasmid counts as indicating the number of new plasmids created by recombination. So, the difference between the two dilutions represents the recombination events. \n\nIn dilution A, there are 40 plasmids, including both original and recombinant. In dilution B, 4 plasmids, mostly original. The extra 36 plasmids must be recombinants. So, 36 out of 44 possible new plasmids came from recombination. 36/44 \u2248 81.8% again.\n\nBut since the options are low percentages, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Maybe it's the ratio of plasmids in A to the sum of plasmids in A and B. Or perhaps the percentage decrease from A to B reflects the loss of plasmids due to recombination.\n\nFrom A to B, plasmids decreased from 40 to 4, a decrease of 36. So, 36/40 = 90%. This suggests that 90% of the plasmids lost their contribution due to recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency is approximately 90%, which isn't an option here. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the experimental design.\n\nWait, another angle: when the phages are plated on B, the ones that didn't cause lysis were from K. So, the number of plasmids in the K-diluted sample indicates that most of the lysogenic phage from B integrated with K's lysogenic phage, reducing the chance of lysing B. Conversely, in the B-diluted sample, fewer plasmids suggest less integration, hence more effective lysogeny.\n\nSo, the difference in plasmid counts between the two samples might relate to the recombination. The K-diluted sample shows 4 plasmids, suggesting that most of the lysogenic phage from B integrated with K's lysogenic phage. The B-diluted sample shows 40 plasmids, suggesting that only a small fraction integrated.\n\nThus, the increase in plasmid count from B-diluted to K-diluted is 36 plasmids. Assuming these are due to recombination, the recombination frequency would be 36/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which aligns with my earlier calculation. Again, this isn't among the answer choices, which range from 0.02% to 5%.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of plasmids that are recombinants relative to the total, which would still give around 81.8%. Since none of the options match, I might have to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe the question asks for the percentage reduction in plasmid concentration due to recombination. From 40 to 4 plasmids, a decrease of 36, which is 90% of the original. But again, this isn't matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two mutations recombine, the offspring may have a higher fitness. In phage terms, this means that lysogenic phages from the heterozygote (one wild type, one mutant) might have a higher chance of lysing cells than either homozygote. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage from B doesn't affect B, while from K it does. \n\nGiven that, the presence of more plasmids in the B-diluted sample suggests that recombination occurred, increasing the efficiency. But calculating exact recombination frequency requires knowing how many of the new plasmids resulted from recombination. Without further information, perhaps the closest answer is that recombination is very high, but the options don't include such a high value.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). These are much lower than 90%. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship between plasmid counts and recombination frequency. Maybe the formula should be based on the initial plasmid counts before recombination.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from B (strain B) and K (strain K) wouldn't integrate, so their plasmids wouldn't combine. With recombination, some plasmids would come from both sources. The number of new plasmids due to recombination would depend on the initial plasmid counts. \n\nAssuming that without recombination, the total plasmids would be the sum of both strains' original plasmids plus any newly integrated ones. But without knowing the original populations, it's hard to apply. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency can be approximated by the difference in plasmid counts between the two dilutions. The K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, and the B-diluted has 40. The increase from 4 to 40 might represent the effect of recombination. \n\nUsing the formula: Recombination Frequency = ((Plasmids in A) - (Plasmids in B)) / (Plasmids in A)  \n= (40 - 4)/40  \n= 36/40  \n= 90%. Still the same issue.\n\nSince none of the options match, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the original plasmids retained after recombination, rather than the percentage lost. If so, then the K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, which is 10% of the original (assuming original was 40). So, recombination accounts for 90% of the original plasmids, meaning 90% of the original were lost due to recombination. But this still doesn't tie directly to the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmids in the two samples. The K-diluted has 4, the B-diluted has 40. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B had a 10x chance of integrating with K's lysogenic phage, implying a high recombination frequency. But again, none of the options reflect 90%.\n\nGiven the available options, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 2%, corresponding to option B. But why? How?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of independent assortment. Normally, without recombination, the two mutations would segregate independently during gamete formation. With recombination, the segregation becomes dependent. So, the expected number of plasmids in a heterozygote would be the average of the two parents. \n\nWithout recombination, each parent contributes normally, so the heterozygote would have plasmids equal to the average. With recombination, some plasmids would come from both parents, increasing the heterozygote plasmid count.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps determine the recombination frequency. Maybe I need to set up an equation.\n\nLet f be the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plasmids in a heterozygote would be p*(1-f) + q*f, where p and q are the proportions of each mutation in the parent genotypes. Assuming each parent contributes equally, p = q = 0.5.\n\nSo, expected plasmids in heterozygote = 0.5*(1-f) + 0.5*f = 0.5.\n\nBut in our case, the heterozygote (from B-K) has more plasmids than the average. So, the observed is greater than 0.5, indicating less recombination. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, actually, in a heterozygote, the number of plasmids should be between the two parental plasmid counts. If recombination happens, the number increases towards the parent plasmid counts.\n\nIn our case, the K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, which is below the parent plasmid count (assuming the parent was 40), and the B-diluted has 40, above the parent. So, the heterozygote has a plasmid count between 4 and 40. If there's no recombination, the heterozygote would have 4 plasmids, but that doesn't make sense because the parent would have 40. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe the correct model is that without recombination, the heterozygote would have the average of the two parents. So, if one parent has 40 and the other has 4, the average would be 22. But our K-diluted sample has 4 and B-diluted has 40, which is inconsistent unless the heterozygote has 22 plasmids on average. But in reality, the K-diluted has 4 and B-diluted has 40, suggesting that the heterozygote has 22 plasmids on average, which doesn't fit with our observation.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me take a step back. The key point is that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from B should integrate with those from K, making the lysogenic phage from B more efficient. The fact that more plasmids are present in the B-diluted sample suggests that recombination occurred, allowing the lysogenic phage from B to integrate with K's lysogenic phage, thus increasing the chance of lysogeny in B and decreasing it in K.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of plasmids lost due to recombination. The K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, while the B-diluted has 40. The loss is 36 plasmids. Assuming these lost plasmids are due to recombination, the recombination frequency would be 36/40 = 90%, which isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is to calculate based on the ratio of plasmids between the two samples, leading to a lower recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is B (2%), thinking that only a small fraction of plasmids were recombinant, but that conflicts with the observed 36 plasmids lost. Unless the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of the original plasmid count, which would be (40 - 36)/40 = 4/40 = 10%, which isn't an option either.\n\nI'm stuck. Given the options, I'll choose B (2%) because sometimes recombination frequencies are reported as small fractions like 1% to 2%, but my calculations keep pointing to 90%, which isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe I misread the problem and the correct approach leads to a lower recombination frequency. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is Recombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Plasmids) / (Total Plasmids in Dilution A). So, 36/40 = 90%. But again, this isn't an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is G (0.5%), assuming a 5% error margin, though that seems arbitrary.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, both types don't cause issues. \n\nNow, the experiment involves treating E. coli strain B with two types of mutantphages at the same time. The results show that half of them are saturated and then diluted 1:10^7, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After plating, there were 4 plaques on K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that recombination refers to the mixing of different alleles or mutations within the same gene locus. In phages, especially T_4, recombination would mean that the two mutations interact. If they recombine, the lysogenic phage might become more efficient at lysing cells because it's better at integrating into the DNA.\n\nThe key here is figuring out how much recombination occurs. The number of plasmids (or copies) each strain has affects the likelihood of recombination. Normally, without recombination, all lysogenic phages replicate independently. But if some recombine, their replication rates change. \n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the result was 40 plasmids on B. On the second dilution (1:10^5), there were 4 plasmas on K. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from strain B has a higher replication rate compared to the lysogenic phage from strain K. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, I think we use the formula: Recombination Frequency = ((Number of Plasmids in Dilution A) - (Number of Plasmids in Dilution B)) / (Total Number of Plasmids in Dilution A). \n\nPlasmids in Dilution A: 40  \nPlasmids in Dilution B: 4  \nTotal: 40 + 4 = 44  \n\nWait, no, that doesn't seem right. Maybe I should approach it differently. If there's complete independence, the expected number of plasmids would be proportional to the dilutions. Alternatively, the ratio of plasmids could indicate the degree of recombination.\n\nAnother way is using the ratio of plasmid numbers. If the recombination frequency is 'f,' then the probability that a phage carries both mutations is f. So, the number of plasmids in dilution A is (1 - f)*N + f*M, where N is normal and M is mutated. Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.\n\nLet me try another approach. The difference in plasmid counts between the two dilutions could indicate the recombination. For example, if f is the recombination fraction, then the expected plasmid count in the first dilution would be (1 - f)*normal + f*mutated. But I'm getting tangled up here.\n\nPerhaps a simpler method is to consider that the recombination frequency can be estimated as (plasmids in dilution A - plasmids in dilution B) / total plasmids in dilution A. That gives (40 - 4)/44 \u2248 36/44 \u2248 81.8%. That seems high. Maybe I'm miscalculating.\n\nAlternatively, considering that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from strain B would integrate with those from strain K, leading to increased efficiency. Since K lacks the mutation, its lysogenic phage shouldn't integrate. So, the presence of more plasmids in dilution A suggests that some recombination occurred. \n\nIf I assume that the recombination frequency is the proportion of times a phage from B integrates with K's lysogenic phage. So, the observed plasmids in dilution A are due to both non-recombined (from B carrying K's phage) and recombined (both have mutations).\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\n- Total plasmids in dilution A: 40\n- Total plasmids in dilution B: 4\n- Plasmids in dilution A that come from B without recombination: x\n- Plasmids in dilution A that come from B with recombination: y\n- Similarly for dilution B: z and w\n\nBut this might get too complicated. Instead, perhaps it's easier to use the ratio of plasmids between the two dilutions to estimate recombination frequency. \n\nThe increase from 4 to 40 plasmids over two dilutions suggests that recombination happened significantly. Using the formula:\n\nRecomb freq = (plasmids_A - plasmids_B) / (plasmids_A)\n\n= (40 - 4)/40 = 36/40 = 90%\n\nThat seems too high, but given the data, it's possible. However, looking back, I realize that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from B should integrate with K's lysogenic phage, meaning that any plasmids in the A-dilution should come from both sources. So, the actual number of new plasmids introduced by recombination would depend on the existing population.\n\nAlternatively, the correct formula might involve the sum of plasmids from both strains. Maybe the number of new plasmids formed due to recombination is (plasmids_A + plasmids_B) * f, where f is the fraction of new plasmids. Then, solving for f:\n\nplasmids_A = plasmids_B + (plasmids_A + plasmids_B) * f  \n40 = 4 + (40 + 4) * f  \n40 - 4 = 44f  \n36 = 44f  \nf \u2248 0.818, which is about 81.8%.\n\nThis still indicates a high recombination frequency, around 82%, which isn't among the options provided. The options go down to 0.02%, which is way lower. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the results.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the plasmid counts as indicating the number of new plasmids created by recombination. So, the difference between the two dilutions represents the recombination events. \n\nIn dilution A, there are 40 plasmids, including both original and recombinant. In dilution B, 4 plasmids, mostly original. The extra 36 plasmids must be recombinants. So, 36 out of 44 possible new plasmids came from recombination. 36/44 \u2248 81.8% again.\n\nBut since the options are low percentages, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Maybe it's the ratio of plasmids in A to the sum of plasmids in A and B. Or perhaps the percentage decrease from A to B reflects the loss of plasmids due to recombination.\n\nFrom A to B, plasmids decreased from 40 to 4, a decrease of 36. So, 36/40 = 90%. This suggests that 90% of the plasmids lost their contribution due to recombination. Thus, the recombination frequency is approximately 90%, which isn't an option here. Therefore, perhaps I misunderstood the experimental design.\n\nWait, another angle: when the phages are plated on B, the ones that didn't cause lysis were from K. So, the number of plasmids in the K-diluted sample indicates that most of the lysogenic phage from B integrated with K's lysogenic phage, reducing the chance of lysing B. Conversely, in the B-diluted sample, fewer plasmids suggest less integration, hence more effective lysogeny.\n\nSo, the difference in plasmid counts between the two samples might relate to the recombination. The K-diluted sample shows 4 plasmids, suggesting that most of the lysogenic phage from B integrated with K's lysogenic phage. The B-diluted sample shows 40 plasmids, suggesting that only a small fraction integrated.\n\nThus, the increase in plasmid count from B-diluted to K-diluted is 36 plasmids. Assuming these are due to recombination, the recombination frequency would be 36/(40 + 4) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which aligns with my earlier calculation. Again, this isn't among the answer choices, which range from 0.02% to 5%.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere. Another possibility is that the recombination frequency is calculated as the percentage of plasmids that are recombinants relative to the total, which would still give around 81.8%. Since none of the options match, I might have to reconsider.\n\nWait, maybe the question asks for the percentage reduction in plasmid concentration due to recombination. From 40 to 4 plasmids, a decrease of 36, which is 90% of the original. But again, this isn't matching the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that when two mutations recombine, the offspring may have a higher fitness. In phage terms, this means that lysogenic phages from the heterozygote (one wild type, one mutant) might have a higher chance of lysing cells than either homozygote. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage from B doesn't affect B, while from K it does. \n\nGiven that, the presence of more plasmids in the B-diluted sample suggests that recombination occurred, increasing the efficiency. But calculating exact recombination frequency requires knowing how many of the new plasmids resulted from recombination. Without further information, perhaps the closest answer is that recombination is very high, but the options don't include such a high value.\n\nLooking at the options, the highest is G (0.5%) and F (0.3%). These are much lower than 90%. Therefore, perhaps I've misunderstood the relationship between plasmid counts and recombination frequency. Maybe the formula should be based on the initial plasmid counts before recombination.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage from B (strain B) and K (strain K) wouldn't integrate, so their plasmids wouldn't combine. With recombination, some plasmids would come from both sources. The number of new plasmids due to recombination would depend on the initial plasmid counts. \n\nAssuming that without recombination, the total plasmids would be the sum of both strains' original plasmids plus any newly integrated ones. But without knowing the original populations, it's hard to apply. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency can be approximated by the difference in plasmid counts between the two dilutions. The K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, and the B-diluted has 40. The increase from 4 to 40 might represent the effect of recombination. \n\nUsing the formula: Recombination Frequency = ((Plasmids in A) - (Plasmids in B)) / (Plasmids in A)  \n= (40 - 4)/40  \n= 36/40  \n= 90%. Still the same issue.\n\nSince none of the options match, perhaps I need to interpret the problem differently. Maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the original plasmids retained after recombination, rather than the percentage lost. If so, then the K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, which is 10% of the original (assuming original was 40). So, recombination accounts for 90% of the original plasmids, meaning 90% of the original were lost due to recombination. But this still doesn't tie directly to the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to calculate the ratio of plasmids in the two samples. The K-diluted has 4, the B-diluted has 40. The ratio is 4:40 or 1:10. This suggests that the lysogenic phage from B had a 10x chance of integrating with K's lysogenic phage, implying a high recombination frequency. But again, none of the options reflect 90%.\n\nGiven the available options, perhaps the intended answer is that the recombination frequency is approximately 2%, corresponding to option B. But why? How?\n\nWait, perhaps I should think in terms of independent assortment. Normally, without recombination, the two mutations would segregate independently during gamete formation. With recombination, the segregation becomes dependent. So, the expected number of plasmids in a heterozygote would be the average of the two parents. \n\nWithout recombination, each parent contributes normally, so the heterozygote would have plasmids equal to the average. With recombination, some plasmids would come from both parents, increasing the heterozygote plasmid count.\n\nBut I'm not sure how this helps determine the recombination frequency. Maybe I need to set up an equation.\n\nLet f be the recombination frequency. Then, the expected number of plasmids in a heterozygote would be p*(1-f) + q*f, where p and q are the proportions of each mutation in the parent genotypes. Assuming each parent contributes equally, p = q = 0.5.\n\nSo, expected plasmids in heterozygote = 0.5*(1-f) + 0.5*f = 0.5.\n\nBut in our case, the heterozygote (from B-K) has more plasmids than the average. So, the observed is greater than 0.5, indicating less recombination. Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion.\n\nWait, actually, in a heterozygote, the number of plasmids should be between the two parental plasmid counts. If recombination happens, the number increases towards the parent plasmid counts.\n\nIn our case, the K-diluted sample has 4 plasmids, which is below the parent plasmid count (assuming the parent was 40), and the B-diluted has 40, above the parent. So, the heterozygote has a plasmid count between 4 and 40. If there's no recombination, the heterozygote would have 4 plasmids, but that doesn't make sense because the parent would have 40. So, perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nMaybe the correct model is that without recombination, the heterozygote would have the average of the two parents. So, if one parent has 40 and the other has 4, the average would be 22. But our K-diluted sample has 4 and B-diluted has 40, which is inconsistent unless the heterozygote has 22 plasmids on average.

One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. After incubation, four plumes are found on K, and 40 are found on B. \n\nWait, I think I might have gotten that backwards. The phages cause the cells to lyse if they're lysogenic. So if the phage is lysogenic, it would kill the E. coli. If it's lysogenic, then when you plate it on strain B, which is lysogenic, it should lyse everything, right? Because both would be lysogenic and replicate. Similarly, if you plate them on strain K, which is also lysogenic, they should lyse all of them. But in reality, the lysogenic phages don't lyse the cells, meaning they're replicating instead of killing them. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage usually leads to lysing the host, so maybe my initial assumption was wrong.\n\nHmm, let me clarify. Lysogenic phages replicate inside the host and produce enzymes to lyse the host. So if you have a lysogenic phage, it will lyse the host cell, leading to death. Whereas if it's a lysogen, it won't lyse the host; it'll just replicate without affecting the cell.\n\nBut wait, in this case, both strains aren't affected. That suggests that either none or some of the phages are causing replication rather than lysis. Maybe the phages have partial resistance or something else.\n\nLooking back at the problem statement: \"T_4 phage that carrymutations in the genomic region called rII can cause the lysisof strain B of E. coli but not of E. coli strain K.\" So when the phage has mutations in rII, it affects strain B (lyses it), but doesn't affect strain K. So strain K must have a mutation that prevents it from being lysed by these phages.\n\nNow, in the experiment, half the plate is plated on strain B and dilated 1:10^7, and the other half on strain K, dilated 1:10^5. The results are four plumes on K and 40 on B. Wait, that seems counterintuitive because if the phages were lysogenic, they should lyse both strains equally. But here, K isn't affected, while B is. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused about which strain is affected.\n\nLet me try again. If a phage is lysogenic, it would lyse the host. So if you plate a lysogenic phage on strain B, which is already lysogenic, the phage would lyse it, resulting in more cell death. Similarly, if you plate it on strain K, which is lysogenic, the same thing happens. But according to the results, only strain B has four plumes, and K has 40. That suggests that the phages causing lysis are only those that mutate strain B, not K.\n\nWait, but the phages themselves carry mutations in rII. So perhaps some phages have mutations that allow them to lyse strain B but not strain K. Alternatively, maybe the phages that lyse strain B do so due to their own mutations in rII, but those that affect K lack such mutations.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of mutations could lead to the phage having a certain level of replication within the host, making some cells lyse and others not. This might depend on whether the phage is under selection for integration into the host genome or not.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, when you plate the phages on the strain, the number of plasmid copies determines whether they integrate into the host genome (and thus influence whether they cause lysis). If the phages integrate, they may lyse the host more effectively because they have a higher chance of replicating within the host and producing enzymes to lyse it.\n\nSo, if the phages that lyse strain B did so because they integrated into the host's DNA, whereas those that didn't lyse because they didn't integrate, then we can infer that the mutations in rII caused some degree of integration or not, leading to varying levels of lysis.\n\nNow, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the phage and the host during integration. If there's high recombination, the phage might integrate well, allowing it to lyse the host. Conversely, low recombination means less integration, so the phage doesn't lyse as much.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are plated on strain B, they cause lysis. On strain K, they don't. This suggests that the phages that cause lysis in B have certain characteristics related to their own mutations in rII and their ability to integrate into the host genome.\n\nIf the mutations in rII allow the phages to integrate better into the host's genome, then more of them would lyse the host, leading to more plumes. However, if the mutations interfere with integration, fewer phages would lyse the host.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows that the phages affecting strain B lyse it, but those affecting strain K do not, we can deduce that the phages that cause lysis in B have a higher likelihood of integrating into the host's genome compared to those that don't.\n\nTo determine the recombination between the two mutations, we need to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed results. Since the problem provides options for percentage points, I assume we need to translate the recombination frequency into a percentage.\n\nThe key is to compare the number of plumes on each strain. On B, there are 4 plumes, on K, 40. Assuming that the number of plumes relates to the number of successful lyses, and that each plume represents a successful infection, we can infer that the phages on B had higher success rates (or lower recombination) in causing lysis.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests that the phages on B were 1/10 as effective in causing lysis as those on K. If the effectiveness is inversely proportional to recombination frequency, then a lower effectiveness would correspond to higher recombination.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about this line of reasoning. Another approach is to consider that if the recombination fraction (the proportion of gametes carrying the mutation) is high, the phage will integrate better, increasing its chances of lyse. Conversely, low recombination would mean less integration, reducing lyse activity.\n\nAssuming that the phages on B that lyse cause a higher level of recombination relative to those on K, we can estimate the recombination frequency. Given the small numbers (only 4 and 40 plumes), it's likely that most of the phages on K did not lyse, indicating low recombination.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the possible percentages are 0.01%, 0.05%, etc. To get a sense, a recombination frequency of around 1% would mean that approximately 1% of the gametes carry the mutation, translating to a relatively high level of integration, which might explain why the phages on B are more effective.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 10 times higher than on B, it suggests that the phages on K are less effective in causing lysis, implying that fewer of them have successfully integrated into the host genome. Therefore, the recombination frequency is probably quite low.\n\nAmong the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible given that the number of plumes is tenfold higher, suggesting a moderate level of recombination. However, since the exact calculation requires knowing the expected distribution based on recombination frequencies, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. If the phages on B lyse more efficiently, it implies that they have higher recombination (more integration). But since the phages on B have fewer plumes, perhaps the recombination is lower than on K.\n\nGiven the data, the phages on B lyse more (4 vs 40), suggesting lower recombination. The correct answer among the options is likely G, 0.5%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Similarly, if you plate it on strain K, which is lysogenic, the same thing happens. But according to the results, only strain B has four plumes, and K has 40. That suggests that the phages causing lysis are only those that mutate strain B, not K.\n\nWait, but the phages themselves carry mutations in rII. So perhaps some phages have mutations that allow them to lyse strain B but not strain K. Alternatively, maybe the phages that lyse strain B do so due to their own mutations in rII, but those that affect K lack such mutations.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of mutations could lead to the phage having a certain level of replication within the host, making some cells lyse and others not. This might depend on whether the phage is under selection for integration into the host genome or not.\n\nIn the context of the experiment, when you plate the phages on the strain, the number of plasmid copies determines whether they integrate into the host genome (and thus influence whether they cause lysis). If the phages integrate, they may lyse the host more effectively because they have a higher chance of replicating within the host and producing enzymes to lyse it.\n\nSo, if the phages that lyse strain B did so because they integrated into the host's DNA, whereas those that didn't lyse because they didn't integrate, then we can infer that the mutations in rII caused some degree of integration or not, leading to varying levels of lysis.\n\nNow, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between the phage and the host during integration. If there's high recombination, the phage might integrate well, allowing it to lyse the host. Conversely, low recombination means less integration, so the phage doesn't lyse as much.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are plated on strain B, they cause lysis. On strain K, they don't. This suggests that the phages that cause lysis in B have certain characteristics related to their own mutations in rII and their ability to integrate into the host genome.\n\nIf the mutations in rII allow the phages to integrate better into the host's genome, then more of them would lyse the host, leading to more plumes. However, if the mutations interfere with integration, fewer phages would lyse the host.\n\nGiven that the experiment shows that the phages affecting strain B lyse it, but those affecting strain K do not, we can deduce that the phages that cause lysis in B have a higher likelihood of integrating into the host's genome compared to those that don't.\n\nTo determine the recombination between the two mutations, we need to calculate the probability of recombination based on the observed results. Since the problem provides options for percentage points, I assume we need to translate the recombination frequency into a percentage.\n\nThe key is to compare the number of plumes on each strain. On B, there are 4 plumes, on K, 40. Assuming that the number of plumes relates to the number of successful lyses, and that each plume represents a successful infection, we can infer that the phages on B had higher success rates (or lower recombination) in causing lysis.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests that the phages on B were 1/10 as effective in causing lysis as those on K. If the effectiveness is inversely proportional to recombination frequency, then a lower effectiveness would correspond to higher recombination.\n\nHowever, I'm not entirely sure about this line of reasoning. Another approach is to consider that if the recombination fraction (the proportion of gametes carrying the mutation) is high, the phage will integrate better, increasing its chances of lyse. Conversely, low recombination would mean less integration, reducing lyse activity.\n\nAssuming that the phages on B that lyse cause a higher level of recombination relative to those on K, we can estimate the recombination frequency. Given the small numbers (only 4 and 40 plumes), it's likely that most of the phages on K did not lyse, indicating low recombination.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, the possible percentages are 0.01%, 0.05%, etc. To get a sense, a recombination frequency of around 1% would mean that approximately 1% of the gametes carry the mutation, translating to a relatively high level of integration, which might explain why the phages on B are more effective.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on K is 10 times higher than on B, it suggests that the phages on K are less effective in causing lysis, implying that fewer of them have successfully integrated into the host genome. Therefore, the recombination frequency is probably quite low.\n\nAmong the options, F is 0.3%, which seems plausible given that the number of plumes is tenfold higher, suggesting a moderate level of recombination. However, since the exact calculation requires knowing the expected distribution based on recombination frequencies, it's a bit tricky.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plumes corresponds to the number of successful infections. If the phages on B lyse more efficiently, it implies that they have higher recombination (more integration). But since the phages on B have fewer plumes, perhaps the recombination is lower than on K.\n\nGiven the data, the phages on B lyse more (4 vs 40), suggesting lower recombination. The correct answer among the options is likely G, 0.5%, but I'm not entirely confident.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

After incubation, there are four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B. \n\nThe goal is to determine the percentage of recombination between these two mutations. Recombination refers to the chance that a mutation from one phage combines with a mutation from another phage during recombination in the host genome. If there's no recombination, the mutations don't influence each other; if there is, they do.\n\nFrom what I remember, when you have independent assortment (or in this case, recombination), the probability of recombination is calculated based on the observed data. Here, the number of pluses on each lawn depends on how many times the mutations occurred independently or together.\n\nStrain B has four pluses on its lawn, which suggests that four mutations resulted in death. Strain K has 40 pluses, indicating more successful mutations. Since the dilutions are different, the ratios should reflect the likelihood of recombination.\n\nLet me think about the formula for calculating the coefficient of coincidence (CO).

However, the number of recombinant deaths isn't directly clear here. Alternatively, maybe we're looking at the probability that a mutation from each phage combination leads to recombination.\n\nAnother approach: when two mutations are present, the number of possible combinations is limited. For example, if a mutation from phage A and a mutation from phage B combine, that could lead to recombination. In our case, each phage contributes one mutation (either non-lethal or lethal), so recombination would mean that the two mutations come from different phages.\n\nWait, but in the experiment, all mutations are either non-lethal or lethal. So perhaps the number of recombinants is the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. But I'm getting a bit confused.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of pluses on each lawn relates to the number of mutations that didn't occur. For strain B, 4 pluses mean 4 mutations didn't happen (i.e., were lethal), and for strain K, 40 pluses mean 40 mutations didn't happen. \n\nThe ratio of pluses on K to B is 40:4, which simplifies to 10:1. This might indicate that the probability of a mutation from phage A causing recombination is higher than from phage B. But I'm not sure how to calculate the exact recombination percentage from this.\n\nMaybe using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence (CO):\n\nCO = (number of recombinant offspring) / (total number of offspring)\nCO = 4 / (4 + 40) = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%\n\nThat seems high, but perhaps it's correct. However, I recall that sometimes the CO is used to estimate the proportion of recombinants relative to the expected without recombination. Wait, perhaps the correct formula involves the product of the probabilities of each mutation happening independently, assuming independence.\n\nIf p is the probability that a mutation from phage A occurs, and q is the probability that a mutation from phage B occurs, then the expected number of recombinant offspring would be p*q*N, where N is the total number of offspring. But since N is the same for both, the ratio would be pq.\n\nGiven that the observed number of recombinant deaths is 4 (from B) and 40 (from K), the ratio is 4:40=1:10. That suggests that the probability of recombination is 1/10, which is 10%, but none of the options match that exactly. Hmm.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm approaching this incorrectly. Let me think about the relationship between the number of pluses and the possibility of recombination. If recombination happened, the number of pluses would depend on the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently. Without recombination, the events would be independent.\n\nSo, suppose that the probability of a mutation from phage A causing recombination is r, and similarly for phage B. Then, the expected number of recombinant deaths would be proportional to r*(1 - r) or something like that. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nAnother angle: the number of pluses on each lawn reflects the number of deaths caused by each mutation. Since the strains are being treated separately, the deaths from each group can be related to the probabilities of each mutation occurring. \n\nFor strain B, 4 pluses mean that 4 mutations didn't occur. Similarly, for strain K, 40 pluses mean 40 mutations didn't occur. The ratio of pluses is 4:40=1:10, suggesting that the probability of a mutation from phage B causing recombination is 10 times less likely than that of phage A? Or vice versa?\n\nWait, perhaps the ratio of pluses indicates the ratio of the probabilities of each mutation. If the probability of a mutation from phage A causing recombination is r_A, and from phage B is r_B, then the number of recombinant deaths would be proportional to r_A * r_B. \n\nBut without knowing the absolute probabilities, it's tricky. Maybe instead, the number of pluses can help us find the probability of recombination. If the total number of deaths is 44, and the number of recombinants is 4, then the probability of recombination is 4/44\u22489.09%. But again, this doesn't align with the answer choices.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the closest is F (0.3%) and G (0.5%). Perhaps I made a miscalculation. Let me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose that the occurrence of mutations in each phage is independent. The probability that a mutation from each phage leads to recombination is p and q respectively. Then, the probability of recombining is p*q. \n\nBut the observed number of recombinants is 4, and the total is 44. So, 4/44\u22489.09% as before. Still not matching any option except possibly F or G, but those are much lower.\n\nPerhaps I misunderstood the setup. Another thought: the number of pluses on each lawn represents the number of cells that died due to each type of mutation. So, 4 pluses on B mean 4 cells died because of mutation A, and 40 on K mean 40 died because of mutation B. \n\nIf there was complete independence, the expected number of recombinant deaths would be the sum over all possible combinations, which in this case, since there are only two mutations, it would just be the product of their individual probabilities. But without knowing the actual probabilities, it's hard to apply.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the coefficient of coincidence is the ratio of observed recombinants to the expected without recombination. So, if there's no recombination, the number of recombinants would be zero. But in reality, there are some, so the CO tells us how much recombination occurred beyond chance.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nCO = (observed recombinant offspring) / (expected recombinant offspring)\n\nExpected recombinant offspring under independence would be (p + q - pq)*N, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, the expected recombinant offspring without recombination is (p * (1-q)) + ((1-p) * q)), but that might not be accurate.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should look up the formula for calculating the coefficient of coincidence to see if I can derive the right approach.\n\nUpon checking, the coefficient of coincidence is defined as the ratio of the observed number of recombinant offspring to the expected number of recombinant offspring under Mendelian inheritance. Under Mendelian assumptions, the expected recombinant offspring would be the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently.\n\nAssuming that the mutations are independent, let\u2019s denote:\n- p = probability that mutation from phage A occurs,\n- q = probability that mutation from phage B occurs.\n\nThen, the expected number of recombinant offspring (where one mutation comes from each phage) would be (p * (1 - q)) + ((1 - p) * q)). But actually, since each phage can cause a mutation, the recombinant offspring would be those where the mutations are from different phages. So, the probability of a recombinant event is p*(1 - q) + (1 - p)*q. \n\nHowever, in our case, the number of pluses corresponds to the number of mutations that failed to occur, meaning that for each phage, the number of cells that died is N*(1 - p) for phage A and N*(1 - q) for phage B. But the observed number of pluses is 4 for B and 40 for K. So, N*(1 - p) = 4 and N*(1 - q) = 40. \n\nWe can solve for p and q:\n\n(1 - p) = 4/N  \n(1 - q) = 40/N  \n\nThus, p = 1 - (4/N)  \nq = 1 - (40/N)  \n\nNow, the expected number of recombinant offspring would be the number of cells where one mutation came from each phage. Since each phage can contribute a mutation, the expected recombinant offspring would be the sum of cells where mutation A from phage A combined with mutation B from phage B. \n\nBut actually, without knowing the exact distribution, it's tricky. Instead, perhaps the CO is calculated as:\n\nCO = (observed recombinant) / (expected recombinant)\n\nWhere expected recombinant is (p * q) * N.\n\nBut since we don't know p and q, we can express them in terms of N.\n\nFrom above:\np = 1 - (4/N)  \nq = 1 - (40/N)  \n\nThus, expected recombinant offspring = (1 - 4/N)(1 - 40/N) * N  \n= [ (1 - 4/N)(1 - 40/N) ] * N  \n= (1 - 45/N + 160/N\u00b2) * N  \n\u2248 (1 - 45/N) * N (since higher-order terms are negligible)  \n\u2248 N - 45  \n\nBut observed recombinant is 4, so:\n\nCO = 4 / (N - 45)  \n\nBut without knowing N, this approach doesn't work. Maybe another way.\n\nSince the number of pluses is 4 and 40, the ratio is 4:40=1:10. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10%, but that's not an option. The closest is G (0.5%), but that's too low. Alternatively, if the probability is 1/10 per event, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, maybe the number of pluses relates to the square root of the CO. Because in some models, the number of observed recombinants is sqrt(CO). So, if the observed number of recombinants is 4, then CO would be approximately 16, which is 16%. But that still doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of pluses is proportional to the CO, then CO would be 4/40=0.1, which is 0.1%, which matches option D. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's go back to basics. The problem states that when both mutantphages infect strain B, only those with the lysogenic phage survive, leading to some plasmids being lost. These plasmids are then tested off the lawn. The results show more plasmids lost on strain K than on strain B.\n\nTo determine the recombination rate, we can use the formula involving the coefficient of coincidence. The CO is the ratio of the observed recombinant plasmids to the expected recombinant plasmids.\n\nThe expected recombinant plasmids (assuming independence) would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let\u2019s say f_A is the frequency of the lysogenic mutation in phage A, and f_B is the frequency in phage B. Then, the expected recombinant plasmids would be f_A * (1 - f_B) + (1 - f_A) * f_B = 2*f_A*f_B - f_A - f_B +1. But without knowing f_A and f_B, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, the observed recombinant plasmids are 4 on B and 40 on K. The total plasmids after infection are 4+40=44. The expected recombinant plasmids would be the sum of plasmids where one mutation comes from each phage. Assuming that the frequencies are such that the expected recombinant is proportional to f_A*f_B*total_plasmids.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe the key is that the number of plasmids lost on K is much higher than on B, indicating that recombination increased the chances of losing plasmids on K.\n\nWait, another approach: the ratio of plasmids lost on K to B is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher on K than on B. But I'm not sure how to translate this into a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmids lost on K is 40, which is 10 times more than on B. If the loss is due to recombination, then the rate of recombination must be higher on K. But without knowing the baseline rates, it's unclear.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended solution is simpler. The number of plasmids lost on K is 40, and on B is 4. The ratio is 10:1, which implies that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher on K. However, since the options are percentages, perhaps the answer is 0.1% (option D) or 0.05% (option J).\n\nBut considering that the ratio is 10:1, which is a significant difference, and the options include small percentages, I'm leaning towards option D (0.1%) or J (0.05%). However, without a direct calculation method, it's challenging to choose accurately.\n\nAfter reconsidering, I believe the correct approach involves calculating the coefficient of coincidence, which requires knowing the probabilities of each mutation. Given the numbers, the recombinant plasmids are 4 out of 44, so the probability is roughly 9%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation, such as the ratio leading to a specific percentage.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest is option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering the numbers, 4 plomas on B and 40 on K suggest a lower recombination rate on K, which points to option F (0.3%) as the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Instead, perhaps the CO is calculated as:\n\nCO = (observed recombinant) / (expected recombinant)\n\nWhere expected recombinant is (p * q) * N.\n\nBut since we don't know p and q, we can express them in terms of N.\n\nFrom above:\np = 1 - (4/N)  \nq = 1 - (40/N)  \n\nThus, expected recombinant offspring = (1 - 4/N)(1 - 40/N) * N  \n= [ (1 - 4/N)(1 - 40/N) ] * N  \n= (1 - 45/N + 160/N\u00b2) * N  \n\u2248 (1 - 45/N) * N (since higher-order terms are negligible)  \n\u2248 N - 45  \n\nBut observed recombinant is 4, so:\n\nCO = 4 / (N - 45)  \n\nBut without knowing N, this approach doesn't work. Maybe another way.\n\nSince the number of pluses is 4 and 40, the ratio is 4:40=1:10. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10%, but that's not an option. The closest is G (0.5%), but that's too low. Alternatively, if the probability is 1/10 per event, but I'm not certain.\n\nWait, maybe the number of pluses relates to the square root of the CO. Because in some models, the number of observed recombinants is sqrt(CO). So, if the observed number of recombinants is 4, then CO would be approximately 16, which is 16%. But that still doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the number of pluses is proportional to the CO, then CO would be 4/40=0.1, which is 0.1%, which matches option D. But I'm not sure if that's the correct approach.\n\nI think I might be overcomplicating this. Let's go back to basics. The problem states that when both mutantphages infect strain B, only those with the lysogenic phage survive, leading to some plasmids being lost. These plasmids are then tested off the lawn. The results show more plasmids lost on strain K than on strain B.\n\nTo determine the recombination rate, we can use the formula involving the coefficient of coincidence. The CO is the ratio of the observed recombinant plasmids to the expected recombinant plasmids.\n\nThe expected recombinant plasmids (assuming independence) would be the product of the frequencies of each mutation. Let\u2019s say f_A is the frequency of the lysogenic mutation in phage A, and f_B is the frequency in phage B. Then, the expected recombinant plasmids would be f_A * (1 - f_B) + (1 - f_A) * f_B = 2*f_A*f_B - f_A - f_B +1. But without knowing f_A and f_B, it's difficult.\n\nAlternatively, the observed recombinant plasmids are 4 on B and 40 on K. The total plasmids after infection are 4+40=44. The expected recombinant plasmids would be the sum of plasmids where one mutation comes from each phage. Assuming that the frequencies are such that the expected recombinant is proportional to f_A*f_B*total_plasmids.\n\nBut this is getting too vague. Maybe the key is that the number of plasmids lost on K is much higher than on B, indicating that recombination increased the chances of losing plasmids on K.\n\nWait, another approach: the ratio of plasmids lost on K to B is 40:4=10:1. This suggests that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher on K than on B. But I'm not sure how to translate this into a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plasmids lost on K is 40, which is 10 times more than on B. If the loss is due to recombination, then the rate of recombination must be higher on K. But without knowing the baseline rates, it's unclear.\n\nAt this point, I think the intended solution is simpler. The number of plasmids lost on K is 40, and on B is 4. The ratio is 10:1, which implies that the probability of recombination is 10 times higher on K. However, since the options are percentages, perhaps the answer is 0.1% (option D) or 0.05% (option J).\n\nBut considering that the ratio is 10:1, which is a significant difference, and the options include small percentages, I'm leaning towards option D (0.1%) or J (0.05%). However, without a direct calculation method, it's challenging to choose accurately.\n\nAfter reconsidering, I believe the correct approach involves calculating the coefficient of coincidence, which requires knowing the probabilities of each mutation. Given the numbers, the recombinant plasmids are 4 out of 44, so the probability is roughly 9%, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on a different interpretation, such as the ratio leading to a specific percentage.\n\nGiven the available options, the closest is option G (0.5%) or F (0.3%). Considering the numbers, 4 plomas on B and 40 on K suggest a lower recombination rate on K, which points to option F (0.3%) as the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell.",

    "rollout": " But when they're tested against strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the lysogenic phage might still be effective or not, depending on how it integrates into the phage's DNA.\n\nThe experiment involves a plate where both types of phage are present. After incubation, half the colonies die, and then each group is diluted and plated again. The K strain has four colonies, and B has 40. \n\nWait, so why did only K have more colonies? Because when the phages were from strain B, only the lysogenic ones affected strain B, while any phages from strain K would either integrate into their phage genome (leaving them functional) or not integrate (causing lytic fission if they do). But since the lysogenic phage isn't active for strain K, maybe only some phages integrate. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the phages from strain B don't integrate into the phage genome, they'll lyse the cells. Those from strain K could either integrate successfully (keeping the lysogenic phenotype) or fail (lyzing). Since only half the colonies died, perhaps half of the phages didn't integrate. Then, when diluting, half the phages are non-integrating, and half integrating. But when you plate them on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, only the integrating phages would cause problems if they replicate, leading to more colonies. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse, so that wouldn't cause new colonies. Instead, maybe the phages that integrate into the phage genome produce new phage particles that can multiply without causing lysis, thus creating new colonies. So if half of the phages don't integrate, they lyse, contributing to the death. The others integrate and create new phages, which grow and form new colonies.\n\nSo if we have N total phages, half (N/2) lyse and contribute to the death. The other half (N/2) integrate and cause new colonies. Now, when these integrated phages are plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, what happens? They should either integrate into the phage genome (leaving them as lysogenic phages, which don't lyse) or not integrate (lyzing, causing new colonies). But wait, if the phages integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic, meaning they don't lyse. However, the lysogenic phage is already part of the phage population, so if they integrate, they remain within the phage's own genome, just like before. So in the case of being plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the integrated phages would stay as lysogenic phages and not cause lysis, hence no new colonies. Alternatively, if they don't integrate, they lyse and cause new colonies. So the number of colonies depends on whether the phages integrate.\n\nBut in this experiment, the K strain had four colonies, and B had 40. So the K strain probably received more integrated phages than the B strain. Let's model this:\n\nAssume there are X phages in total. Half (X/2) lyse (don't survive), contributing to the death. The other half (X/2) integrate. Now, when these integrate and are plated on strain B, which lacks the mutation, the lysogenic phage remains, so new colonies form. When the same phages are plated on strain K, which also lacks the mutation, if they integrate, they remain as lysogenic, but if they don't integrate, they lyse and cause new colonies. But since the K strain was not exposed to the mutation, integration may or may not occur.\n\nWait, actually, the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when they integrate into the phage genome, they remain lysogenic. But when they're plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the lysogenic phages won't lyse, so they will grow and form new colonies. Conversely, if the phages integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic, and when plated on strain K, they won't lyse, forming new colonies. But if the phages don't integrate, they lyse, contributing to the death.\n\nNow, in the experiment, the K strain had four colonies, and B had 40. So the K strain had fewer colonies, implying that less phage caused lysis there. That suggests that fewer phages integrated, leaving them as lysogenic, hence no new colonies. While on B, more phages integrated, causing new colonies, so more colonies grew.\n\nWait, but the phages from strain B were lysogenic, so when they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic themselves, meaning they don't lyse. So when plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, those integrated phages would still be lysogenic and not cause lysis, resulting in new colonies. So the number of colonies formed on K would depend on whether the phages integrated or not. Similarly, on B, the phages that integrate would cause new colonies, while those that don't integrate would lyse and cause death.\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\n- Total phages: P\n\n- Phages that lyse: P/2\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2\n\nWhen plating on strain K (which lacks the mutation):\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2 * probability of integration \u2192 if they integrate, they remain lysogenic, so new colonies form.\n\n- Phages that don't integrate: P/2 * probability of non-integration \u2192 if they don't integrate, they lyse, so new colonies die.\n\nSimilarly, when plating on strain B (which lacks the mutation):\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2 * probability of integration \u2192 if they integrate, they become lysogenic, so new colonies form.\n\n- Phages that don't integrate: P/2 * probability of non-integration \u2192 if they don't integrate, they lyse, so new colonies die.\n\nHowever, since the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing issues on strain B, but not on strain K, maybe the integration probability differs between the two strains. But since both strains lack the mutation, the integration probabilities might be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integration rate is the same for both strains, but in reality, different strains might have different levels of integration. However, in this problem, we're told that the lysogenic phage from strain B affects strain B, but not strain K. So the integration must affect the outcome differently depending on the host strain.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, we can use the ratio of colonies to infer the level of integration. On K, we have four colonies, which likely correspond to the integrated phages not causing lysis, while on B, we have 40 colonies, corresponding to the phages that integrated and caused new colonies. \n\nBut wait, if the phages from B are lysogenic, they would lyse on strain K but cause new colonies on strain B. So when plating on K, the phages that integrate would remain lysogenic, so no new colonies; the phages that don't integrate lyse, so new colonies die. Therefore, on K, the number of colonies should be proportional to the fraction of phages that integrate. \n\nOn B, the phages that integrate would lyse (if they don't integrate on K?), but wait, no. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so if they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic themselves, so they don't lyse. Thus, when plating on B, the phages that integrate would not cause lysis, so new colonies form. The phages that don't integrate lyse and don't form new colonies. \n\nTherefore, when plating on K, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, assuming all integrate. When plating on B, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, plus the number that don't integrate and lyse. Wait, no. Actually, when plating on B, the phages that integrate would not lyse (since they are now lysogenic), so they would form new colonies. The phages that don't integrate lyse and die, so no new colonies. Therefore, on B, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, assuming they don't lyse. \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. On B, the lysogenic phage hasn't integrated yet, right? Or wait, the phage from strain B is already lysogenic because it's carrying the mutation. So when it's plated on K, which lacks the mutation, the phages don't integrate into the phage genome. Therefore, they lyse, causing new colonies. So on K, the phages that integrate stay lysogenic, so no new colonies. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and cause new colonies. Additionally, if any phages integrate into the phage genome (on B), they become lysogenic, so they don't lyse, thus forming new colonies. But wait, initially, on B, the phages are already lysogenic, so when they are plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and form new colonies. Also, if some phages integrate into the phage genome on B, they become lysogenic, so when plated on B, they don't lyse, thus forming new colonies. So the number of colonies on B would be the number of phages that integrate (so they don't lyse) plus the original phages that didn't lyse. Hmm, this is getting too detailed.\n\nMaybe a simpler approach: Let\u2019s assume that the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when they are plated on K, they don\u2019t integrate, leading to lysis and new colonies. When they are plated on B, they remain lysogenic, so no lysis occurs. But wait, on B, the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing issues, so when it's plated on K, it doesn't cause lysis. So on K, the phages that integrate (from strain B) stay lysogenic, so no new colonies. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don\u2019t integrate, so lyse and form new colonies. Also, any phages that integrate into B's phage genome would become lysogenic, so they don't lyse, forming new colonies. But initially, the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when plated on B, they don't lyse. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps another way: Each phage carries a mutation, either mutation A (mutation in genomic region rII) or mutation B (no mutation). When they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic. When they don't integrate, they lyse.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed and plated on K and B, the following happens:\n\n- On K:\n   - Plated phages: half integrate (remain lysogenic), half don't integrate (lyse).\n   - Colony count: 4.\n   - So, only 4 colonies, meaning most phages integrated and remained lysogenic.\n\n- On B:\n   - Plated phages: half integrate (become lysogenic), half don't integrate (lyse).\n   - Colony count: 40.\n   - So, 40 colonies mean mostly phages didn't integrate and lye.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phages from strain B are already causing issues on strain B. So when they're plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and cause new colonies. When they're plated on B, they don't integrate, so they lyse, but since they're already lysogenic, they don't cause further issues. However, the initial experiment shows that on B, 40 colonies form, which includes both the original phages that didn't lyze and the new ones. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial population includes both types of phages. So when you mix them, the proportion determines the likelihood of integration. Let's say there are N phages total. N/2 are from strain B (lysogenic) and N/2 from K (non-lysogenic). When plating on K, which lacks mutation, the N/2 from B integrate (remain lysogenic), so they don't cause lysis, thus forming new colonies. The N/2 from K don't integrate, so they lyse and die. On K, the number of colonies is the number of phages that integrate (so no lysis), which is N/2 * p_integrate. Similarly, on B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and form new colonies. When plated on B, the lysogenic phages don't lyse, so they form new colonies. Plus, any phages that integrate into the phage genome on B remain lysogenic, so they don't lyse, forming new colonies. \n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe using the formula for expected colonies. Suppose the number of phages that integrate is q, so q = p_integrate. Then, on K, the number of colonies would be proportional to the fraction that integrate and don't lyse, which is q. On B, the number of colonies would include both the phages that integrate (still lysogenic) and those that don't integrate and lyse, so colonies = (N/2 * (1 - q)) + (N/2 * q) = N/2. But in the experiment, on B, colonies = 40, which is higher than N/2. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integration rate is the same for both strains, but the presence of the mutation affects the outcome. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: Use the formula for the expected number of colonies. Let's denote:\n\n- P_total = N (total phages)\n\n- P integrate = x (fraction that integrate)\n\n- P don't integrate = N - x\n\nWhen plated on K (no mutation):\n\n- Integrate phages: P integrate \u00d7 survival rate (don't lyse) = x \u00d7 (probability don't lyse)\n- Don't integrate phages: (N - x) \u00d7 probability lyse = (N - x) \u00d7 y\n\nColony count on K: x \u00d7 s + (N - x) \u00d7 d = 4\n\nWhere s is the survival rate of integrate phages and d is the death rate due to lysis. Since we don't know s and d, perhaps we can assume that s = 1 and d = 1, meaning phages either integrate and lyse or don't integrate and lyse. But that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when phages integrate, they lyse, so s = 0. And when they don't integrate, they don't lyse, so d = 0. But that would mean no colonies, which contradicts the data.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is flawed. Maybe instead, the number of colonies reflects the number of phages that integrated and didn't lyse, plus those that didn't integrate and survived. But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options provided, perhaps the key lies in calculating the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency (RF) is the proportion of double crossovers relative to all double crossovers plus single crossovers. It's often expressed as a percentage.\n\nTo find RF, we can calculate the crossover frequency (CF) first. The CF is calculated using the formula:\n\nCF = 100 \u00d7 [ (p \u00d7 q \u00d7 100) / (p \u00d7 q + p \u00d7 (1 - q) + (1 - p) \u00d7 q + (1 - p) \u00d7 (1 - q)) ) ]\n\nWhere p is the rate of one crossover and q is the rate of another crossover. But this requires knowing the rates of individual crossovers, which aren't given.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the observed recombination rate (observed RF) is the sum of the products of the allele frequencies at each locus. But without allele frequencies, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nGiven the answer choices, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the mutation affects the outcome, and the recombination frequency can be inferred from the difference in the number of colonies.\n\nWait, another idea: The experiment measures the effect of the mutation. If the mutation causes recombination, it would lead to increased or decreased recombinant offspring. In this context, the presence of the mutation affects the segregation of the phage genome during replication.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from strain B (with mutation) integrates into the phage genome, it becomes a double-stranded phage, which upon replication, produces recombinant phage genomes. The presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of recombination, which would affect the segregation during replication.\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage from B is plated on K, it doesn't integrate, so it doesn't cause recombination. When it's plated on B, it integrates, causing recombination, which leads to more lysogenic phages, possibly reducing the number of new colonies.\n\nBut in the data, on K, 4 colonies form, whereas on B, 40. If integration increased the number of recombinants, then on B, more colonies should form, which matches the data (40 > 4). \n\nHowever, the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. To calculate RF, we typically look at the number of double crossovers relative to all crossovers. Without allele frequencies, it's difficult. But maybe the key lies in the number of colonies and the expected ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of colonies. If the mutation leads to more recombinant offspring, the RF would be higher. But in the absence of allele frequencies, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant phages can be used to estimate RF. For example, if R is the number of recombinant phages and D is the number of double crossovers, then RF = (R + D)/T, where T is the total number of crossovers. Without knowing T, it's impossible to compute RF directly.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that the presence of the mutation reduces the number of viable phages, leading to fewer colonies. However, the exact calculation isn't straightforward without additional information.\n\nSince the user asked for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, and the options are percentages, perhaps the correct answer is based on the ratio of colonies. On K, 4 colonies, on B, 40. Assuming that recombination increases the number of viable phages, the increase from 4 to 40 suggests significant recombination. However, without knowing the baseline, it's challenging to quantify.\n\nGiven the options provided, I'm inclined to choose option F: 0.3 percent, as it represents a small recombination frequency, suggesting minimal recombination between the two mutations. However, this reasoning might not",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they're tested against strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the lysogenic phage might still be effective or not, depending on how it integrates into the phage's DNA.\n\nThe experiment involves a plate where both types of phage are present. After incubation, half the colonies die, and then each group is diluted and plated again. The K strain has four colonies, and B has 40. \n\nWait, so why did only K have more colonies? Because when the phages were from strain B, only the lysogenic ones affected strain B, while any phages from strain K would either integrate into their phage genome (leaving them functional) or not integrate (causing lytic fission if they do). But since the lysogenic phage isn't active for strain K, maybe only some phages integrate. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. If the phages from strain B don't integrate into the phage genome, they'll lyse the cells. Those from strain K could either integrate successfully (keeping the lysogenic phenotype) or fail (lyzing). Since only half the colonies died, perhaps half of the phages didn't integrate. Then, when diluting, half the phages are non-integrating, and half integrating. But when you plate them on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, only the integrating phages would cause problems if they replicate, leading to more colonies. Wait, no, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse, so that wouldn't cause new colonies. Instead, maybe the phages that integrate into the phage genome produce new phage particles that can multiply without causing lysis, thus creating new colonies. So if half of the phages don't integrate, they lyse, contributing to the death. The others integrate and create new phages, which grow and form new colonies.\n\nSo if we have N total phages, half (N/2) lyse and contribute to the death. The other half (N/2) integrate and cause new colonies. Now, when these integrated phages are plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, what happens? They should either integrate into the phage genome (leaving them as lysogenic phages, which don't lyse) or not integrate (lyzing, causing new colonies). But wait, if the phages integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic, meaning they don't lyse. However, the lysogenic phage is already part of the phage population, so if they integrate, they remain within the phage's own genome, just like before. So in the case of being plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the integrated phages would stay as lysogenic phages and not cause lysis, hence no new colonies. Alternatively, if they don't integrate, they lyse and cause new colonies. So the number of colonies depends on whether the phages integrate.\n\nBut in this experiment, the K strain had four colonies, and B had 40. So the K strain probably received more integrated phages than the B strain. Let's model this:\n\nAssume there are X phages in total. Half (X/2) lyse (don't survive), contributing to the death. The other half (X/2) integrate. Now, when these integrate and are plated on strain B, which lacks the mutation, the lysogenic phage remains, so new colonies form. When the same phages are plated on strain K, which also lacks the mutation, if they integrate, they remain as lysogenic, but if they don't integrate, they lyse and cause new colonies. But since the K strain was not exposed to the mutation, integration may or may not occur.\n\nWait, actually, the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when they integrate into the phage genome, they remain lysogenic. But when they're plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, the lysogenic phages won't lyse, so they will grow and form new colonies. Conversely, if the phages integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic, and when plated on strain K, they won't lyse, forming new colonies. But if the phages don't integrate, they lyse, contributing to the death.\n\nNow, in the experiment, the K strain had four colonies, and B had 40. So the K strain had fewer colonies, implying that less phage caused lysis there. That suggests that fewer phages integrated, leaving them as lysogenic, hence no new colonies. While on B, more phages integrated, causing new colonies, so more colonies grew.\n\nWait, but the phages from strain B were lysogenic, so when they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic themselves, meaning they don't lyse. So when plated on strain K, which doesn't have the mutation, those integrated phages would still be lysogenic and not cause lysis, resulting in new colonies. So the number of colonies formed on K would depend on whether the phages integrated or not. Similarly, on B, the phages that integrate would cause new colonies, while those that don't integrate would lyse and cause death.\n\nGiven that, let's denote:\n\n- Total phages: P\n\n- Phages that lyse: P/2\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2\n\nWhen plating on strain K (which lacks the mutation):\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2 * probability of integration \u2192 if they integrate, they remain lysogenic, so new colonies form.\n\n- Phages that don't integrate: P/2 * probability of non-integration \u2192 if they don't integrate, they lyse, so new colonies die.\n\nSimilarly, when plating on strain B (which lacks the mutation):\n\n- Phages that integrate: P/2 * probability of integration \u2192 if they integrate, they become lysogenic, so new colonies form.\n\n- Phages that don't integrate: P/2 * probability of non-integration \u2192 if they don't integrate, they lyse, so new colonies die.\n\nHowever, since the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing issues on strain B, but not on strain K, maybe the integration probability differs between the two strains. But since both strains lack the mutation, the integration probabilities might be similar.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the integration rate is the same for both strains, but in reality, different strains might have different levels of integration. However, in this problem, we're told that the lysogenic phage from strain B affects strain B, but not strain K. So the integration must affect the outcome differently depending on the host strain.\n\nThis seems complicated. Maybe instead, we can use the ratio of colonies to infer the level of integration. On K, we have four colonies, which likely correspond to the integrated phages not causing lysis, while on B, we have 40 colonies, corresponding to the phages that integrated and caused new colonies. \n\nBut wait, if the phages from B are lysogenic, they would lyse on strain K but cause new colonies on strain B. So when plating on K, the phages that integrate would remain lysogenic, so no new colonies; the phages that don't integrate lyse, so new colonies die. Therefore, on K, the number of colonies should be proportional to the fraction of phages that integrate. \n\nOn B, the phages that integrate would lyse (if they don't integrate on K?), but wait, no. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so if they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic themselves, so they don't lyse. Thus, when plating on B, the phages that integrate would not cause lysis, so new colonies form. The phages that don't integrate lyse and don't form new colonies. \n\nTherefore, when plating on K, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, assuming all integrate. When plating on B, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, plus the number that don't integrate and lyse. Wait, no. Actually, when plating on B, the phages that integrate would not lyse (since they are now lysogenic), so they would form new colonies. The phages that don't integrate lyse and die, so no new colonies. Therefore, on B, the number of colonies would be equal to the number of phages that integrate, assuming they don't lyse. \n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. On B, the lysogenic phage hasn't integrated yet, right? Or wait, the phage from strain B is already lysogenic because it's carrying the mutation. So when it's plated on K, which lacks the mutation, the phages don't integrate into the phage genome. Therefore, they lyse, causing new colonies. So on K, the phages that integrate stay lysogenic, so no new colonies. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and cause new colonies. Additionally, if any phages integrate into the phage genome (on B), they become lysogenic, so they don't lyse, thus forming new colonies. But wait, initially, on B, the phages are already lysogenic, so when they are plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and form new colonies. Also, if some phages integrate into the phage genome on B, they become lysogenic, so when plated on B, they don't lyse, thus forming new colonies. So the number of colonies on B would be the number of phages that integrate (so they don't lyse) plus the original phages that didn't lyse. Hmm, this is getting too detailed.\n\nMaybe a simpler approach: Let\u2019s assume that the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when they are plated on K, they don\u2019t integrate, leading to lysis and new colonies. When they are plated on B, they remain lysogenic, so no lysis occurs. But wait, on B, the lysogenic phage from strain B is causing issues, so when it's plated on K, it doesn't cause lysis. So on K, the phages that integrate (from strain B) stay lysogenic, so no new colonies. On B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don\u2019t integrate, so lyse and form new colonies. Also, any phages that integrate into B's phage genome would become lysogenic, so they don't lyse, forming new colonies. But initially, the phages from strain B are lysogenic, so when plated on B, they don't lyse. Wait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps another way: Each phage carries a mutation, either mutation A (mutation in genomic region rII) or mutation B (no mutation). When they integrate into the phage genome, they become lysogenic. When they don't integrate, they lyse.\n\nIn the experiment, when the phages are mixed and plated on K and B, the following happens:\n\n- On K:\n   - Plated phages: half integrate (remain lysogenic), half don't integrate (lyse).\n   - Colony count: 4.\n   - So, only 4 colonies, meaning most phages integrated and remained lysogenic.\n\n- On B:\n   - Plated phages: half integrate (become lysogenic), half don't integrate (lyse).\n   - Colony count: 40.\n   - So, 40 colonies mean mostly phages didn't integrate and lye.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phages from strain B are already causing issues on strain B. So when they're plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and cause new colonies. When they're plated on B, they don't integrate, so they lyse, but since they're already lysogenic, they don't cause further issues. However, the initial experiment shows that on B, 40 colonies form, which includes both the original phages that didn't lyze and the new ones. This seems contradictory.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial population includes both types of phages. So when you mix them, the proportion determines the likelihood of integration. Let's say there are N phages total. N/2 are from strain B (lysogenic) and N/2 from K (non-lysogenic). When plating on K, which lacks mutation, the N/2 from B integrate (remain lysogenic), so they don't cause lysis, thus forming new colonies. The N/2 from K don't integrate, so they lyse and die. On K, the number of colonies is the number of phages that integrate (so no lysis), which is N/2 * p_integrate. Similarly, on B, the phages are lysogenic, so when plated on K, they don't integrate, so they lyse and form new colonies. When plated on B, the lysogenic phages don't lyse, so they form new colonies. Plus, any phages that integrate into the phage genome on B remain lysogenic, so they don't lyse, forming new colonies. \n\nBut this is getting too tangled. Maybe using the formula for expected colonies. Suppose the number of phages that integrate is q, so q = p_integrate. Then, on K, the number of colonies would be proportional to the fraction that integrate and don't lyse, which is q. On B, the number of colonies would include both the phages that integrate (still lysogenic) and those that don't integrate and lyse, so colonies = (N/2 * (1 - q)) + (N/2 * q) = N/2. But in the experiment, on B, colonies = 40, which is higher than N/2. Hmm, perhaps my assumption is wrong.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the integration rate is the same for both strains, but the presence of the mutation affects the outcome. However, without knowing the exact relationship, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAnother approach: Use the formula for the expected number of colonies. Let's denote:\n\n- P_total = N (total phages)\n\n- P integrate = x (fraction that integrate)\n\n- P don't integrate = N - x\n\nWhen plated on K (no mutation):\n\n- Integrate phages: P integrate \u00d7 survival rate (don't lyse) = x \u00d7 (probability don't lyse)\n- Don't integrate phages: (N - x) \u00d7 probability lyse = (N - x) \u00d7 y\n\nColony count on K: x \u00d7 s + (N - x) \u00d7 d = 4\n\nWhere s is the survival rate of integrate phages and d is the death rate due to lysis. Since we don't know s and d, perhaps we can assume that s = 1 and d = 1, meaning phages either integrate and lyse or don't integrate and lyse. But that might not make sense.\n\nAlternatively, considering that when phages integrate, they lyse, so s = 0. And when they don't integrate, they don't lyse, so d = 0. But that would mean no colonies, which contradicts the data.\n\nHmm, perhaps the approach is flawed. Maybe instead, the number of colonies reflects the number of phages that integrated and didn't lyse, plus those that didn't integrate and survived. But without knowing the exact probabilities, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options provided, perhaps the key lies in calculating the recombination frequency. Recombination frequency (RF) is the proportion of double crossovers relative to all double crossovers plus single crossovers. It's often expressed as a percentage.\n\nTo find RF, we can calculate the crossover frequency (CF) first. The CF is calculated using the formula:\n\nCF = 100 \u00d7 [ (p \u00d7 q \u00d7 100) / (p \u00d7 q + p \u00d7 (1 - q) + (1 - p) \u00d7 q + (1 - p) \u00d7 (1 - q)) ) ]\n\nWhere p is the rate of one crossover and q is the rate of another crossover. But this requires knowing the rates of individual crossovers, which aren't given.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider that the observed recombination rate (observed RF) is the sum of the products of the allele frequencies at each locus. But without allele frequencies, this approach isn't feasible.\n\nGiven the answer choices, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of the mutation affects the outcome, and the recombination frequency can be inferred from the difference in the number of colonies.\n\nWait, another idea: The experiment measures the effect of the mutation. If the mutation causes recombination, it would lead to increased or decreased recombinant offspring. In this context, the presence of the mutation affects the segregation of the phage genome during replication.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage from strain B (with mutation) integrates into the phage genome, it becomes a double-stranded phage, which upon replication, produces recombinant phage genomes. The presence of the mutation increases the likelihood of recombination, which would affect the segregation during replication.\n\nIn the experiment, when the lysogenic phage from B is plated on K, it doesn't integrate, so it doesn't cause recombination. When it's plated on B, it integrates, causing recombination, which leads to more lysogenic phages, possibly reducing the number of new colonies.\n\nBut in the data, on K, 4 colonies form, whereas on B, 40. If integration increased the number of recombinants, then on B, more colonies should form, which matches the data (40 > 4). \n\nHowever, the question asks for the recombination frequency between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. To calculate RF, we typically look at the number of double crossovers relative to all crossovers. Without allele frequencies, it's difficult. But maybe the key lies in the number of colonies and the expected ratios.\n\nWait, perhaps the recombination frequency is related to the ratio of colonies. If the mutation leads to more recombinant offspring, the RF would be higher. But in the absence of allele frequencies, this is speculative.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of recombinant phages can be used to estimate RF. For example, if R is the number of recombinant phages and D is the number of double crossovers, then RF = (R + D)/T, where T is the total number of crossovers. Without knowing T, it's impossible to compute RF directly.\n\nGiven the confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to realize that the presence of the mutation reduces the number of viable phages, leading to fewer colonies. However, the exact calculation isn't straightforward without additional information.\n\nSince the user asked for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, and the options are percentages, perhaps the correct answer is based on the ratio of colonies. On K, 4 colonies, on B, 40. Assuming that recombination increases the number of viable phages, the increase from 4 to 40 suggests significant recombination. However, without knowing the baseline, it's challenging to quantify.\n\nGiven the options provided, I'm inclined to choose option F: 0.3 percent, as it represents a small recombination frequency, suggesting minimal recombination between the two mutations. However, this reasoning might not",

The first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. This should show how many times the phage has replicated. If no plumes form, there's no replication; a few might indicate partial replication. Then, the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Plumes here would tell us about the lysogenic mutation since only those plasmids replicate without causing cell death.\n\nLooking at the results: four pluses on strain K and 40 on B. That means four of the K plates had plasmid replication, indicating four recombinants, while 40 B plates didn't have any plasmid replication, suggesting none of the B plates had the lysogenic mutation. Wait, actually, if four K plates have plasmid replication, that suggests four recombinant phages carrying both mutations. Because when a lysogenic phage replicates, it carries both wild-type and mutant DNA, right? So each successful replication event would produce a phage with both mutations.\n\nSo if four K plates had plasmid replication, that implies four instances where the lysogenic phage successfully replicated. Since each plasmid has two copies of the T_4 gene\u2014wild-type and mutated\u2014the number of recombinations would be twice the number of successful plasmid replication events. But wait, no. Each phage carrying both mutations would contribute two plasmid replication successes. Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait, another approach: In a normal situation, only the lysogenic phage (mutant) would cause lysis. When both types are present, only the lysogenic ones cause issues. But in this case, some cells survive, meaning their phages didn't cause lysis. So the presence of plasmids indicates that the lysogenic mutation is present.\n\nWhen the phages are mixed, the number of plasmids per cell depends on how much lysogenic phage is present. If the lysogenic phage is rare, most cells will have wild-type phages, leading to fewer plasmids. If the lysogenic phage is abundant enough, some cells will have multiple phages or even plasmids.\n\nBut according to the results, only four cells from the K plate had plasmids. That suggests that among the K cells, four of them received the lysogenic phage, which caused replication. However, these four cells were plated on strain K, which shouldn't have the lysogenic mutation. Wait, that doesn't make sense because if the lysogenic mutation was present, the cells should have the mutation regardless of the host. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nWait, let me read again. The two mutantphages are causing lytic and lysogenic effects. When mixed, half the cells die (only lysogenic), and the other half don't. Then, the first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. The second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. On the K plate, four pluses are found, and on the B plate, 40 pluses.\n\nSo the four K pluses mean that four cells had plasmids, implying that the lysogenic mutation was present in those cells. But those cells were plated on strain K, which presumably doesn't have the lysogenic mutation. That contradicts unless the lysogenic phage somehow modifies the host, which isn't typical. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage didn't affect the host's ability to replicate, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four K pluses represent plasmid replication events, and each plasmid has one copy of the T_4 gene. So four plasmids would mean four copies of the T_4 mutation. But wait, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would imply that the same T_4 mutation is present in both phages, but that's not possible because one is wild-type and the other is mutant.\n\nWait, no. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, but in this context, it's about the T_4 phage carrying both mutations. But in this case, the lysogenic phage already carries the mutation, so recombination wouldn't apply here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plasmids indicates the number of successful replication events for the lysogenic phage. If four K plates have plasmid replication, that suggests four instances where the lysogenic phage successfully replicated, each time producing a new phage with both mutations. But wait, each replication would produce two new phages (one wild-type and one mutant?), so four plasmids would require two recombination events. Or perhaps each successful replication event increases the number of T_4 genes in the phage by one.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage usually has its T_4 gene knocked out, as it uses the phage DNA instead of its own T_4. So when a lysogenic phage replicates, it produces new phages with the same T_4 mutation. So each replication event adds one T_4 mutation. Therefore, if four cells have plasmid replication, that suggests four T_4 mutations, but that can't be right because the question asks about recombination.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up things. Let me try a simpler approach. The number of plasmids (or phages carrying T_4) on the K plate tells us how many times the lysogenic phage has replicated. Each replication event doubles the number of T_4 mutations, assuming the original is wild-type. So if four K plasmids are found, that could mean four replications, but that would lead to more mutations than just recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the proportion of recombination events. Recombination would involve swapping genetic material between two homologous chromosomes, but in this case, we're dealing with the T_4 phage, which is a single locus.\n\nWait, no. Recombination in this context probably refers to the transfer of the T_4 mutation between the two mutantphages. Since one is wild-type and the other is lysogenic, recombination would occur if the same T_4 mutation exists in both. But in this case, the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, so recombination wouldn't change anything. So perhaps the question is misworded, but I'll proceed under the assumption that recombination refers to the presence of both mutations in the same phage.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids on the K plate indicates how many times the lysogenic phage has replicated. If four K plasmids are found, that suggests four successful replication events. Each replication event requires a recombination point, but I'm not sure how to calculate that directly.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of plasmids across all cells gives an idea of the number of mutations. For example, if 80% of the cells have plasmids, that's 80% of the population having the lysogenic mutation. But since the question is about recombination, perhaps it's referring to the fraction of cells that have both mutations, which would be proportional to the square root of the observed frequency due to Mendelian inheritance.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that four K pluses are found, and 40 on B. So four cells from the K plate have the lysogenic mutation, and 40 from B do not. But this doesn't directly relate to recombination. Recombination would determine whether the same mutation appears in both mutantphages.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage has the mutation, the number of plasmids on the K plate reflects the number of times the mutation was passed along. If four plasmids are found on K, that suggests four instances of the mutation being carried, but I'm still not seeing how that ties to recombination percentage.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The key is to consider the expected number of recombination events. Recombination occurs when the same chromosome exchanges genetic material with another. In the context of phages, it would refer to the transfer of the T_4 mutation between the two mutantphages. \n\nIn experiments like this, the probability of recombination is often estimated using the formula sqrt(f), where f is the fraction of recombinant offspring. But in this case, we're looking at plasmid replication rather than gamete production.\n\nWait, another thought: If four K plasmids are found, that could mean that four times the lysogenic phage has replicated. Each replication event would involve a recombination point, but I'm not sure how to translate that into a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of plasmids on the K plate could indicate that the lysogenic phage has been transferred to a subset of the cells. If the lysogenic phage has a certain transmission efficiency, say 5%, then 5% of cells would have the mutation. But in this case, four plasmids are found on the K plate, so 80% of cells have the mutation, meaning 80% of the population carries the lysogenic mutation. But that doesn't directly give the recombination rate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing plasmid transfer efficiency with recombination rates. Perhaps the number of plasmids corresponds to the number of mutations. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, that could mean four mutations, but again, that's not related to recombination.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or formulas. In the context of phage genetics, the frequency of recombination can be estimated using the number of recombinant plasmids divided by the total number of plasmids. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer lies in calculating the expected number of recombinant events. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, and we assume that each plasmid represents a replication event, then the number of recombinants would be four. But the question is about the percentage of recombination.\n\nWait, the options given are percentages: 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., which are very low. That suggests that the recombination rate is extremely low, meaning that the same T_4 mutation is not likely to be transferred between the two mutantphages. Thus, the plasmid replication success rate is very high, which aligns with the fact that four plasmids are found on K.\n\nIf four plasmids are found on K, that could imply that the lysogenic phage has had a high transmission efficiency, say around 80%. But the question is about recombination, not transmission. However, if the same T_4 mutation is present in both mutantphages, there would be zero recombination because they share the same mutation.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage already carries the mutation, so recombination wouldn't occur between the two. That would suggest that the recombination rate is zero, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of both mutations in the same phage, which would indicate recombination.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, so recombination wouldn't create a new mutation. Therefore, the number of plasmids on K and B would reflect whether the lysogenic phage is present in each strain.\n\nWait, going back, the four plasmids on K might indicate that the lysogenic phage is present in four cells, meaning that the lysogenic mutation is present in four cells. But since those cells were plated on strain B, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, why would they die? Unless the lysogenic phage somehow affects the host, but that's not standard.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. The correct approach is to realize that the presence of plasmids indicates that the lysogenic phage has replicated, thus showing that the mutation is present in the host cells. If four K plasmids are found, that suggests that four cells have the lysogenic mutation. However, since those cells were plated on strain B, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, they shouldn't have died. So perhaps the presence of plasmids is misleading, or maybe the experiment setup is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four plasmids on K mean that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times, each time introducing a new phage with the mutation. If each replication event requires a recombination point, then four such events would correspond to a certain percentage of recombination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula or method used to estimate recombination percentage, it's challenging to proceed accurately. Given the options provided, the lowest percentage is 0.02%, which might imply a very low recombination rate, consistent with a high transmission efficiency of the lysogenic phage.\n\nHowever, I'm still unsure about the direct calculation needed. Another angle: The number of plasmids on the K plate (four) plus those on the B plate (40) equals the total plasmids. If the lysogenic phage has a certain transmission efficiency, say t, then the expected number of plasmids in each strain would depend on t. But without additional data, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids on the K plate (four) implies that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times, each time carrying a new mutation. If each replication event involves a recombination, then the number of recombinants would be equal to the number of replication events. Assuming that each replication event introduces a new mutation, four plasmids would mean four recombinants. But the question is about recombination between the two mutations, which may not fit.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key information is that four plasmids are found on the K plate, indicating that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times. Each replication event introduces a new mutation, so four plasmids would mean four new mutations. However, since the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, recombination wouldn't create a new mutation. Therefore, the presence of four plasmids on the K plate suggests that the lysogenic phage has successfully replicated four times, implying that the mutation is present in four cells, which are then plated on strain B, leading to no deaths because strain B doesn't have the mutation. But this doesn't explain the numbers given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, and each plasmid represents a successful replication event, then the recombination rate would be determined by the number of plasmids relative to the total number of phages. But without knowing the total number, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options, the smallest percentage is 0.02%, which suggests a very low recombination rate. This would align with the scenario where the lysogenic phage has a high transmission efficiency, making the plasmid replication events frequent, hence resulting in a low recombination percentage.\n\nTherefore, despite my confusion, I'll choose the option corresponding to the lowest percentage, which is E. 0.02 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

When mixed, half the cells die (only lysogenic), and the other half don't. Then, the first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B. The second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. On the K plate, four pluses are found, and on the B plate, 40 pluses.\n\nSo the four K pluses mean that four cells had plasmids, implying that the lysogenic mutation was present in those cells. But those cells were plated on strain K, which presumably doesn't have the lysogenic mutation. That contradicts unless the lysogenic phage somehow modifies the host, which isn't typical. Alternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage didn't affect the host's ability to replicate, but that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four K pluses represent plasmid replication events, and each plasmid has one copy of the T_4 gene. So four plasmids would mean four copies of the T_4 mutation. But wait, the question is about recombination between the two mutations. Recombination would imply that the same T_4 mutation is present in both phages, but that's not possible because one is wild-type and the other is mutant.\n\nWait, no. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes during meiosis, but in this context, it's about the T_4 phage carrying both mutations. But in this case, the lysogenic phage already carries the mutation, so recombination wouldn't apply here. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nAnother angle: The number of plasmids indicates the number of successful replication events for the lysogenic phage. If four K plates have plasmid replication, that suggests four instances where the lysogenic phage successfully replicated, each time producing a new phage with both mutations. But wait, each replication would produce two new phages (one wild-type and one mutant?), so four plasmids would require two recombination events. Or perhaps each successful replication event increases the number of T_4 genes in the phage by one.\n\nWait, no. The lysogenic phage usually has its T_4 gene knocked out, as it uses the phage DNA instead of its own T_4. So when a lysogenic phage replicates, it produces new phages with the same T_4 mutation. So each replication event adds one T_4 mutation. Therefore, if four cells have plasmid replication, that suggests four T_4 mutations, but that can't be right because the question asks about recombination.\n\nWait, I think I'm mixing up things. Let me try a simpler approach. The number of plasmids (or phages carrying T_4) on the K plate tells us how many times the lysogenic phage has replicated. Each replication event doubles the number of T_4 mutations, assuming the original is wild-type. So if four K plasmids are found, that could mean four replications, but that would lead to more mutations than just recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is asking about the proportion of recombination events. Recombination would involve swapping genetic material between two homologous chromosomes, but in this case, we're dealing with the T_4 phage, which is a single locus.\n\nWait, no. Recombination in this context probably refers to the transfer of the T_4 mutation between the two mutantphages. Since one is wild-type and the other is lysogenic, recombination would occur if the same T_4 mutation exists in both. But in this case, the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, so recombination wouldn't change anything. So perhaps the question is misworded, but I'll proceed under the assumption that recombination refers to the presence of both mutations in the same phage.\n\nGiven that, the number of plasmids on the K plate indicates how many times the lysogenic phage has replicated. If four K plasmids are found, that suggests four successful replication events. Each replication event requires a recombination point, but I'm not sure how to calculate that directly.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of plasmids across all cells gives an idea of the number of mutations. For example, if 80% of the cells have plasmids, that's 80% of the population having the lysogenic mutation. But since the question is about recombination, perhaps it's referring to the fraction of cells that have both mutations, which would be proportional to the square root of the observed frequency due to Mendelian inheritance.\n\nBut wait, the problem states that four K pluses are found, and 40 on B. So four cells from the K plate have the lysogenic mutation, and 40 from B do not. But this doesn't directly relate to recombination. Recombination would determine whether the same mutation appears in both mutantphages.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage has the mutation, the number of plasmids on the K plate reflects the number of times the mutation was passed along. If four plasmids are found on K, that suggests four instances of the mutation being carried, but I'm still not seeing how that ties to recombination percentage.\n\nPerhaps I'm approaching this wrong. The key is to consider the expected number of recombination events. Recombination occurs when the same chromosome exchanges genetic material with another. In the context of phages, it would refer to the transfer of the T_4 mutation between the two mutantphages. \n\nIn experiments like this, the probability of recombination is often estimated using the formula sqrt(f), where f is the fraction of recombinant offspring. But in this case, we're looking at plasmid replication rather than gamete production.\n\nWait, another thought: If four K plasmids are found, that could mean that four times the lysogenic phage has replicated. Each replication event would involve a recombination point, but I'm not sure how to translate that into a percentage.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of plasmids on the K plate could indicate that the lysogenic phage has been transferred to a subset of the cells. If the lysogenic phage has a certain transmission efficiency, say 5%, then 5% of cells would have the mutation. But in this case, four plasmids are found on the K plate, so 80% of cells have the mutation, meaning 80% of the population carries the lysogenic mutation. But that doesn't directly give the recombination rate.\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing plasmid transfer efficiency with recombination rates. Perhaps the number of plasmids corresponds to the number of mutations. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, that could mean four mutations, but again, that's not related to recombination.\n\nHmm, I'm stuck. Maybe I should look for similar problems or formulas. In the context of phage genetics, the frequency of recombination can be estimated using the number of recombinant plasmids divided by the total number of plasmids. But I'm not sure how that applies here.\n\nWait, perhaps the answer lies in calculating the expected number of recombinant events. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, and we assume that each plasmid represents a replication event, then the number of recombinants would be four. But the question is about the percentage of recombination.\n\nWait, the options given are percentages: 0.02%, 0.05%, etc., which are very low. That suggests that the recombination rate is extremely low, meaning that the same T_4 mutation is not likely to be transferred between the two mutantphages. Thus, the plasmid replication success rate is very high, which aligns with the fact that four plasmids are found on K.\n\nIf four plasmids are found on K, that could imply that the lysogenic phage has had a high transmission efficiency, say around 80%. But the question is about recombination, not transmission. However, if the same T_4 mutation is present in both mutantphages, there would be zero recombination because they share the same mutation.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage already carries the mutation, so recombination wouldn't occur between the two. That would suggest that the recombination rate is zero, which isn't one of the options. Alternatively, perhaps the question is referring to the presence of both mutations in the same phage, which would indicate recombination.\n\nWait, but in this scenario, the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, so recombination wouldn't create a new mutation. Therefore, the number of plasmids on K and B would reflect whether the lysogenic phage is present in each strain.\n\nWait, going back, the four plasmids on K might indicate that the lysogenic phage is present in four cells, meaning that the lysogenic mutation is present in four cells. But since those cells were plated on strain B, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, why would they die? Unless the lysogenic phage somehow affects the host, but that's not standard.\n\nMaybe I'm missing something. The correct approach is to realize that the presence of plasmids indicates that the lysogenic phage has replicated, thus showing that the mutation is present in the host cells. If four K plasmids are found, that suggests that four cells have the lysogenic mutation. However, since those cells were plated on strain B, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, they shouldn't have died. So perhaps the presence of plasmids is misleading, or maybe the experiment setup is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the four plasmids on K mean that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times, each time introducing a new phage with the mutation. If each replication event requires a recombination point, then four such events would correspond to a certain percentage of recombination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact formula or method used to estimate recombination percentage, it's challenging to proceed accurately. Given the options provided, the lowest percentage is 0.02%, which might imply a very low recombination rate, consistent with a high transmission efficiency of the lysogenic phage.\n\nHowever, I'm still unsure about the direct calculation needed. Another angle: The number of plasmids on the K plate (four) plus those on the B plate (40) equals the total plasmids. If the lysogenic phage has a certain transmission efficiency, say t, then the expected number of plasmids in each strain would depend on t. But without additional data, it's hard to compute.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of plasmids on the K plate (four) implies that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times, each time carrying a new mutation. If each replication event involves a recombination, then the number of recombinants would be equal to the number of replication events. Assuming that each replication event introduces a new mutation, four plasmids would mean four recombinants. But the question is about recombination between the two mutations, which may not fit.\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating this. The key information is that four plasmids are found on the K plate, indicating that the lysogenic phage has replicated four times. Each replication event introduces a new mutation, so four plasmids would mean four new mutations. However, since the lysogenic phage already has the mutation, recombination wouldn't create a new mutation. Therefore, the presence of four plasmids on the K plate suggests that the lysogenic phage has successfully replicated four times, implying that the mutation is present in four cells, which are then plated on strain B, leading to no deaths because strain B doesn't have the mutation. But this doesn't explain the numbers given.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. If four plasmids are found on the K plate, and each plasmid represents a successful replication event, then the recombination rate would be determined by the number of plasmids relative to the total number of phages. But without knowing the total number, it's tricky.\n\nGiven the options, the smallest percentage is 0.02%, which suggests a very low recombination rate. This would align with the scenario where the lysogenic phage has a high transmission efficiency, making the plasmid replication events frequent, hence resulting in a low recombination percentage.\n\nTherefore, despite my confusion, I'll choose the option corresponding to the lowest percentage, which is E. 0.02 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

    "chunk_resampled": "But when they're both present, the outcome is different for each strain.",
    "rollout": " But when they're both present, the outcome is different for each strain.\n\nFirst, the initial experiment plates E. coli strain B with two types of mutantphages. The result was a saturation split into two halves: one half was dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half was dilated 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. \n\nThe key observation here is that half of the bacteria died on strain B, which suggests that the lysogenic mutation caused them to lyse the cell. However, the same half survived on strain K, indicating that the lytic mutation didn't affect strain K. This implies that there's some recombination between the two mutations\u2014so parts of the T_4 genome have both mutations.\n\nNow, I need to calculate the percentage of recombinant DNA fragments from these experiments. Recombination would mean that a segment has both mutations, allowing the lysogenic phage to replicate without killing the cells.\n\nFrom the initial test, the first half (diluted 1:10^7) had some lysogenic mutants. Plating this on strain B resulted in a certain number of plasmid copies. Similarly, the second half (diluted 1:10^5) also had some lysogenic mutants, and plating this on strain K showed another set of plasmids.\n\nThe total number of plasmids expected if there were no recombination would be the sum of the plasmids from both halves. If recombination occurred, the actual number of plasmids would differ based on how many segments carried both mutations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- P1 as the proportion of lysogenic mutants in the first half.\n- P2 as the proportion in the second half.\n\nWhen you plate on strain B, the lysogenic mutants (with lysogenic plasmids) will survive. On strain K, the lysogenic mutants won't survive because their phage doesn't lyse the cell. Therefore, the number of surviving plasmids on strain B corresponds to the number of lysogenic mutants in the first half. On strain K, the number of surviving plasmids corresponds to the number of lysogenic mutants minus those that recombine.\n\nWait, maybe I should think differently. Since the lysogenic mutants kill on B and don't kill on K, the ratio of plasmids on B versus K tells us about the presence of recombination.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then all lysogenic mutants in the first half would die on B, and none would die on K. So the number of plasmids on B and K would be equal. But in reality, we see that some plasmids survive on B (those from original lysogenic mutants), while fewer survive on K (because some recombined lysogenic plasmids aren't replicated well or don't replicate at all).\n\nSo let's say the first half (1:10^7) had N plasmids. Of these, n1 are lysogenic. Plating on B gives n1 plasmids. Plating on K gives n1 - r plasmids, where r is the number of recombines.\n\nSimilarly, the second half (1:10^5) had M plasmids, with m1 lysogenic. On B, m1; on K, m1 - r.\n\nBut since the first half was more concentrated (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), the numbers might be higher, but perhaps the exact counts are tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratios:\n\nOn B, the ratio of plasmids is n1/n_total_B = (n1) / (n1 + n1 - r) ) \u2248 r/(n1), assuming n1 >> r.\n\nOn K, the ratio is (n1 - r)/n_total_K \u2248 r/(n1).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The number of plasmids on B is proportional to the number of lysogenic mutants, and on K, it's proportional to lysogenic minus recombination.\n\nSince the initial test shows that half the bacteria died on B, meaning that half the lysogenic mutants survived, implying that half the lysogenic plasmids survived. That suggests that the proportion of recombination is such that half of the lysogenic mutants were lost on K.\n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, if x% of the DNA is recombinant, then the fraction surviving on B is 1 - x, and on K, it's 1 - x as well? Wait, no, because only the lysogenic mutants (which require a recombine site) can cause death on B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating it. Maybe using the formula for the probability of survival.\n\nThe number of surviving plasmids on B is the number of original lysogenic mutants (without recombination). On K, it's the same number minus those that recombine.\n\nGiven that, the ratio of plasmids on B to K would depend on the recombination rate.\n\nIn the initial test, the number of plasmids on B is equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants, and on K, it's original minus recombination. Since half survived on B, that means half of the lysogenic mutants were from regions without recombination.\n\nBut without knowing the exact values, perhaps the recombination frequency can be estimated based on the observed outcomes.\n\nAnother approach: The ratio of plasmids on B and K can give an idea of the recombination fraction. Suppose R is the fraction of DNA that is recombinant. Then, the number of plasmids on B is proportional to (1 - R) * N_total, and on K, it's (1 - R) * N_total. Wait, that doesn't make sense because on K, the lysogenic mutants don't replicate.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids on B is proportional to the number of original lysogenic mutants plus any that were lost due to recombination. No, wait, lysogenic mutants don't lose themselves upon replication\u2014they just don't lyse. So the number of plasmids on B would be equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants (since recombination doesn't remove lysogenic plasmids, only wildtype ones do).\n\nSimilarly, on K, the number of plasmids is equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants minus the number of recombination events (each recombination removes one lysogenic plasmid).\n\nBut since we only have half the population dying on B, that suggests that half the lysogenic mutants survived. So if Y is the number of lysogenic mutants, then on B, Y survives, and on K, Y - X survives, where X is the number of recombination events.\n\nBut since it's a random sample, we can model this probabilistically. Let\u2019s assume that the probability of recombination per locus is p. Then, the expected number of recombination events in a population of size N is approximately Np.\n\nBut in our case, the number of surviving plasmids on B is equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants, and on K, it's the same minus the number of recombination events.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact counts, perhaps we can estimate the recombination frequency based on the fact that on B, half the lysogenic mutants survived, implying that the recombination happened in half of the loci.\n\nWait, no, because if recombination happens in half the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be less than on K, since some lysogenic plasmids would be lost.\n\nBut in our case, on B, half the bacteria died, meaning half the lysogenic mutants survived. On K, only half the lysogenic mutants survived, but the same number of lysogenic plasmids. Hmm, that doesn't quite add up.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If recombination occurs, then the lysogenic plasmids lose one copy each time. So if recombination happens in half the loci, then the number of plasmids on B would be (1 - p) times the original, and on K, it would be (1 - p) times the original minus p times the original.\n\nBut given that on B, half the lysogenic mutants survived, which suggests that p is 0.5. Because if p is 0.5, then on B, (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 of the lysogenic plasmids remain, and on K, it's (1 - 0.5) = 0.5, but since recombination affects lysogenic only, the total on K would be 0.5*(1 - 0.5) = 0.25, which contradicts the data.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the ratio of plasmids on B to K is related to the square root of the recombination fraction. Or maybe it's better to use the formula for the probability of survival.\n\nThe probability that a bacterium survives is (1 - recombination rate)^number of independent sites. Assuming each locus is independent, the overall survival probability is (1 - r)^L, where L is the number of loci. But in our case, we have a fixed number of plasmids, so perhaps it's simpler.\n\nAlternatively, since we have half the bacteria dying on B, which indicates that half the lysogenic mutants survived. That could mean that the recombination rate is 0.5, because half the lysogenic plasmids were lost, leaving half that survived.\n\nBut wait, if recombination happens in half the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be (1 - 0.5) = 0.5, and on K, it would be (1 - 0.5)*(1 - 0.5) = 0.25. But in our case, on B, half survived, and on K, half survived too, but on B, the count is higher because the concentration was higher.\n\nThis seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated based on the number of plasmids on each plate.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the number of plasmids on B is N_b and on K is N_k. The observed number of survivors on B is S_b, and on K is S_k.\n\nAssuming that the number of original lysogenic plasmids is O, then S_b = O and S_k = O - R, where R is the number of recombination events.\n\nBut without knowing O, we can\u2019t directly compute R. However, the ratio of plasmids on B to K would be O : (O - R). If we take the ratio as (O)/(O - R) = ratio of plasmids on B to K.\n\nBut without specific numbers, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the ratio of surviving plasmids on each plate can indicate the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the initial test shows that half the lysogenic mutants survived on B, suggesting that the recombination happened in half the loci. Thus, the recombination frequency is 0.5, corresponding to option G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but the options include percentages like 0.1%, 0.2%, etc., up to 0.5%. Let me check again.\n\nIf recombination happened in half the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be half of the original, and on K, it would be half minus half of half, which is quarter. But according to the problem, on B, half died, meaning half survived, and on K, half survived as well, but that doesn't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of surviving plasmids on each plate reflects the recombination frequency. For example, if recombination happened in x% of the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be sqrt(x%) of the original, and on K, it would be sqrt(1 - x%) of the original. But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of surviving plasmids on B is equal to the number of original lysogenic plasmids multiplied by (1 - recombination frequency), and on K, it's the same multiplied by (1 - recombination frequency) squared, assuming each recombination event reduces the number of plasmids.\n\nBut without precise counts, it's challenging. Given the options, the most straightforward interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 50%, leading to option G (0.5%). Therefore, I'll choose G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they're both present, the outcome is different for each strain.\n\nFirst, the initial experiment plates E. coli strain B with two types of mutantphages.

Since the lysogenic mutants kill on B and don't kill on K, the ratio of plasmids on B versus K tells us about the presence of recombination.\n\nIf there's no recombination, then all lysogenic mutants in the first half would die on B, and none would die on K. So the number of plasmids on B and K would be equal. But in reality, we see that some plasmids survive on B (those from original lysogenic mutants), while fewer survive on K (because some recombined lysogenic plasmids aren't replicated well or don't replicate at all).\n\nSo let's say the first half (1:10^7) had N plasmids. Of these, n1 are lysogenic. Plating on B gives n1 plasmids. Plating on K gives n1 - r plasmids, where r is the number of recombines.\n\nSimilarly, the second half (1:10^5) had M plasmids, with m1 lysogenic. On B, m1; on K, m1 - r.\n\nBut since the first half was more concentrated (1:10^7 vs 1:10^5), the numbers might be higher, but perhaps the exact counts are tricky.\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratios:\n\nOn B, the ratio of plasmids is n1/n_total_B = (n1) / (n1 + n1 - r) ) \u2248 r/(n1), assuming n1 >> r.\n\nOn K, the ratio is (n1 - r)/n_total_K \u2248 r/(n1).\n\nWait, maybe another approach. The number of plasmids on B is proportional to the number of lysogenic mutants, and on K, it's proportional to lysogenic minus recombination.\n\nSince the initial test shows that half the bacteria died on B, meaning that half the lysogenic mutants survived, implying that half the lysogenic plasmids survived. That suggests that the proportion of recombination is such that half of the lysogenic mutants were lost on K.\n\nIn terms of recombination frequency, if x% of the DNA is recombinant, then the fraction surviving on B is 1 - x, and on K, it's 1 - x as well?

Suppose R is the fraction of DNA that is recombinant. Then, the number of plasmids on B is proportional to (1 - R) * N_total, and on K, it's (1 - R) * N_total. Wait, that doesn't make sense because on K, the lysogenic mutants don't replicate.\n\nWait, actually, the number of plasmids on B is proportional to the number of original lysogenic mutants plus any that were lost due to recombination. No, wait, lysogenic mutants don't lose themselves upon replication\u2014they just don't lyse. So the number of plasmids on B would be equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants (since recombination doesn't remove lysogenic plasmids, only wildtype ones do).\n\nSimilarly, on K, the number of plasmids is equal to the number of original lysogenic mutants minus the number of recombination events (each recombination removes one lysogenic plasmid).\n\nBut since we only have half the population dying on B, that suggests that half the lysogenic mutants survived.

So if recombination happens in half the loci, then the number of plasmids on B would be (1 - p) times the original, and on K, it would be (1 - p) times the original minus p times the original.\n\nBut given that on B, half the lysogenic mutants survived, which suggests that p is 0.5. Because if p is 0.5, then on B, (1 - 0.5) = 0.5 of the lysogenic plasmids remain, and on K, it's (1 - 0.5) = 0.5, but since recombination affects lysogenic only, the total on K would be 0.5*(1 - 0.5) = 0.25, which contradicts the data.\n\nHmm, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the ratio of plasmids on B to K is related to the square root of the recombination fraction. Or maybe it's better to use the formula for the probability of survival.\n\nThe probability that a bacterium survives is (1 - recombination rate)^number of independent sites. Assuming each locus is independent, the overall survival probability is (1 - r)^L, where L is the number of loci. But in our case, we have a fixed number of plasmids, so perhaps it's simpler.\n\nAlternatively, since we have half the bacteria dying on B, which indicates that half the lysogenic mutants survived. That could mean that the recombination rate is 0.5, because half the lysogenic plasmids were lost, leaving half that survived.\n\nBut wait, if recombination happens in half the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be (1 - 0.5) = 0.5, and on K, it would be (1 - 0.5)*(1 - 0.5) = 0.25. But in our case, on B, half survived, and on K, half survived too, but on B, the count is higher because the concentration was higher.\n\nThis seems conflicting. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is calculated based on the number of plasmids on each plate.\n\nLet\u2019s consider that the number of plasmids on B is N_b and on K is N_k. The observed number of survivors on B is S_b, and on K is S_k.\n\nAssuming that the number of original lysogenic plasmids is O, then S_b = O and S_k = O - R, where R is the number of recombination events.\n\nBut without knowing O, we can\u2019t directly compute R. However, the ratio of plasmids on B to K would be O : (O - R). If we take the ratio as (O)/(O - R) = ratio of plasmids on B to K.\n\nBut without specific numbers, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps the answer lies in recognizing that the ratio of surviving plasmids on each plate can indicate the recombination frequency.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the initial test shows that half the lysogenic mutants survived on B, suggesting that the recombination happened in half the loci. Thus, the recombination frequency is 0.5, corresponding to option G (0.5%).\n\nWait, but the options include percentages like 0.1%, 0.2%, etc., up to 0.5%. Let me check again.\n\nIf recombination happened in half the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be half of the original, and on K, it would be half minus half of half, which is quarter. But according to the problem, on B, half died, meaning half survived, and on K, half survived as well, but that doesn't align with my previous reasoning.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of surviving plasmids on each plate reflects the recombination frequency. For example, if recombination happened in x% of the loci, then the number of surviving plasmids on B would be sqrt(x%) of the original, and on K, it would be sqrt(1 - x%) of the original. But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, the number of surviving plasmids on B is equal to the number of original lysogenic plasmids multiplied by (1 - recombination frequency), and on K, it's the same multiplied by (1 - recombination frequency) squared, assuming each recombination event reduces the number of plasmids.\n\nBut without precise counts, it's challenging. Given the options, the most straightforward interpretation is that the recombination frequency is 50%, leading to option G (0.5%). Therefore, I'll choose G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, the recombination rate must be high enough to make the lysogenic phage survive in K but die in B.\n\nThe formula for recombination frequency (RF) is RF = 1 - 1/(n+1), where n is the number of recombinant individuals. Here, n would be the number of colonies where both types of phage caused issues, but in our case, only the lysogenic affected B. Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic affects B but not K. So, the lysogenic phage should have some effect on both strains. \n\nWait, actually, in this scenario, the lysogenic phage didn't cause problems in B, but worked fine on K. That means the lysogenic phage has a recombination event that makes it non-lethal in K but lethal in B. So, the likelihood of recombination is such that in K, the lysogenic phage survives, but in B, it dies.\n\nIn a typical double-recombination test, if two mutants each cause lethality, you get recombinants. Here, the lysogenic phage is causing lethality in B but not K, implying some recombination. \n\nThe standard approach is to look at the number of viable offspring. Since the lysogenic phage killed all B colonies (probably because it's lethal in B), but worked on K, it indicates some recombination. \n\nIf we consider that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that allows it to replicate without killing the host, then maybe there's some interference. Alternatively, the lack of lethality in B might suggest that the mutation isn't occurring in B, or occurs at a low frequency.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcome. Without any recombination, both lysogenic phages would cause lethality in both strains. If recombination happens, some lysogenic phages might become susceptible to B, and others might still kill K. But in this case, only the lysogenic phage from B kills, while the lysogenic phage from K works well.\n\nAssuming that recombination happened at a certain rate, let's say R%, we can model the outcomes. Each phage type (mutant and wild-type) has a certain probability of recombining. For example, if the recombination rate is R%, then the proportion of recombined phages would be R%.\n\nSo, in the B colonies (where the lysogenic phage is lethal), some of the recombined phages would still be present, allowing them to survive, but since recombination increases their activity, perhaps they can reproduce better? Or maybe the presence of the mutated phage in B allows it to survive despite being lethal. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the test result: only the lysogenic phage on B died, while the lysogenic on K worked. This suggests that the lysogenic phage on K had a recombination event that allowed it to survive in B but not in K. \n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would depend on how many times the lysogenic phage could integrate into the T_4 genome. If recombination occurred once, the chance that the lysogenic phage was transformed is 50%. But in this case, since the lysogenic phage on B died, that implies that the transformation did not happen in B. However, since the lysogenic phage on K worked, it suggests that the integration occurred in K but not in B. \n\nTherefore, the recombination rate would be the fraction of lysogenic phages that integrated in K compared to the total. If the lysogenic phage on K survived, but the one on B died, it suggests that recombination increased its viability in K but decreased it in B. \n\nBut how do we calculate the recombination percentage? Maybe using the fact that in the absence of recombination (no crossover), both lysogenic phages would be lethal in both strains. With some recombination, the lysogenic phages may survive in B but not in K.\n\nLooking up similar experiments, a common way to determine recombination frequency is to use a double-lot experiment. If both mutants are lethal in a strain, you count the number of recombinant colonies (both mutants present) and divide by the total number of viable offspring.\n\nHowever, in our case, the lysogenic phage on B is lethal, meaning no viable offspring from that group. The lysogenic phage on K reproduces successfully, leading to some viable colonies. So, the number of viable colonies from the K treatment is equal to the number of recombinant phages multiplied by the number of phages present.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the exact calculation here. Another approach is to assume that the recombination frequency corresponds to the ratio of successful combinations. If only the lysogenic phage from K worked, but the one from B died, it suggests that the lysogenic phage from B had recombination events that made it lethal, while the one from K didn't.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps a simpler approach is to note that the recombination frequency can be estimated by the difference in survival rates. Since the lysogenic phage on B is lethal, and on K it's not, the recombination must allow the lysogenic phage on K to survive in B but not on B.\n\nThis seems tricky. Maybe another angle: the initial population has two types of phages. After treatment with intermediate dilution, some are present in sufficient quantities to potentially infect the E. coli. Then, when plated, some colonies will form.\n\nIn the first half, after intermediate dilution, the phages are so abundant that most colonies will show some kind of combination. In the second half, the phage concentration is higher, so fewer colonies will form.\n\nThe results are that 4 are found on K and 40 on B. Given that the lysogenic phage on B is lethal, those 40 colonies must have been due to the lysogenic phage on K. Since the lysogenic phage on K is not lethal, it can infect the E. coli, leading to colonies.\n\nNow, considering that the lysogenic phage on K works well, it's possible that it integrates without major disruption, giving it a good chance to replicate. The number of colonies found on K is 4, which gives us information about the efficiency of the transformation.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination frequency? Recombination frequency relates to the likelihood of the mutation occurring at the T_4 locus. If the mutation causes a change in the lysogenic phage's replication, perhaps through recombination, then the presence of a recombination event would increase the viability of the phage in some conditions but not others.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage on B dies, indicating that either the mutation was absent in B or that the mutation made it lethal. On the other hand, the lysogenic phage on K works fine, suggesting that the mutation was present in K but not in B.\n\nSo, if the mutation caused a change in the lysogenic phage's activity, making it less effective, but integrating into the T_4 genome, that could explain why it's lethal in B but works in K. \n\nTo find the recombination frequency, perhaps we can consider the ratio of the number of recombinant colonies to the total number of viable colonies. But in this case, the lysogenic phage on B is lethal, so there are zero viable colonies from that group. From the K group, there are 4 viable colonies. \n\nWait, but without knowing the total number of phages introduced, it's hard to compute the exact recombination frequency. Alternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recombination leads to a certain percentage of the lysogenic phages becoming susceptible in B but not in K.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, the answer choices are percentages like 0.05% or 0.02%. These seem very small, which might imply that the recombination is rare.\n\nAnother thought: if the lysogenic phage on B is lethal, it suggests that the mutation is present in B but causes lethality. The lysogenic phage on K works, meaning the mutation wasn't present in K. Therefore, the recombination must have occurred, but it's happening in a way that makes the lysogenic phage in K non-lethal.\n\nBut how does that translate to a specific percentage? Maybe the recombination rate is calculated as follows:\n\nTotal phages introduced = x.\n\nPhages in intermediate dilution = y.\n\nPhages in final dilution = z.\n\nThe number of recombinant phages would be proportional to the recombination frequency.\n\nBut without knowing y and z, it's unclear. Alternatively, perhaps the recombination frequency is determined by the number of viable offspring divided by the total number of offspring.\n\nIn the K group, 4 are found, assuming that these are recombinant phages.

One group is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, resulting in some number of plques. The other group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, giving four plques on K and 40 on B. From these results, we're supposed to determine how much recombination there is between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of different alleles or mutations in the same gene locus. In this case, the two mutations are from different phages causing different fission methods. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis, only the non-lytic phage affects strain B. Strain K doesn't have either mutation, so no effect.\n\nThe experiment involves cross-inhibition and dilution effects. When you mix cells from two different strains, the cross-inhibition effect occurs if the two strains are compatible, meaning their replication machinery isn't interfering. If incompatible, the phages might replicate in each other's genome, leading to recombination.\n\nIn this case, the first group is a mixture of strain B and the lysogenic phage. It's diluted more heavily (1:10^7), so fewer plques would be expected without recombination. However, since only lysogenic phage affects B, plques should be low. The second group has a less concentrated mixture (1:10^5) and is placed on K, where neither mutation exists. So, without recombination, neither strain would respond favorably to the phage. But here, strain K responds better to the lysogenic phage than strain B, indicating some interaction.\n\nWait, actually, when the first group (strain B + lysogenic phage) is plated on strain B, it shouldn't produce any plques because the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B. But the problem states that the first group is divided equally between being plated on B and K? No, wait, the description says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the initial division is into two equal parts, each part is then treated separately.\n\nSo, half the culture is plated on strain B and the other half on strain K. Each part is diluted at different concentrations. The first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B, while the second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on K. Results show 40 plques on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage affected the B strain but not the K strain, implying that the two mutations interacted in the presence of strain B but not in K.\n\nIf there were no recombination, the lysogenic phage would affect both strains equally. But here, on B, it affects B, not K, so there must be some interaction. Recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage from B somehow affects the K strain, perhaps due to the presence of the lysogenic phage in B's environment.\n\nBut wait, in reality, recombination would typically lead to interference in one strain but not another unless specific conditions allow for it. Here, the lysogenic phage from B affects B but not K. This suggests that the two mutations interact in such a way that when the lysogenic phage is present in strain B, it affects its own replication in a way that also impacts strain K. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we look at the ratio of recombinant plques to total plques. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage in strain B leads to a higher number of plques on B than usual. Normally, if there was no interaction, the plque density would depend on whether the phage affects the strain. But here, the phage affects B but not K, suggesting that the two mutations are interacting in a way that increases plque density in the presence of strain B.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is F = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total individuals). But in terms of plques, it's similar. The observed plques on K are 4, and on B are 40. Assuming normal distribution, the expected plque density without recombination would be proportional to the probability of recombination. However, since the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination rate is higher when strain B is present.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of strain B allows the lysogenic phage to interact with the K strain, increasing the likelihood of recombination. To find the exact percentage, we might use the ratio of plques. The plque density on B is significantly higher, suggesting a higher likelihood of recombination. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K, the increase in plques on B compared to normal could indicate the degree of recombination. If normal plque density were around 100 per well, say, and on B it's 40, that's a reduction of 60%. On K, it's 4, which is about 10% of normal. The difference suggests that the recombination event increased plque density in B but didn't affect K as much.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, F = (Observed - Expected)/Expected. Without recombination, plques on B would be lower. Here, plques on B are higher, so F is positive. Calculating F = (40 - x)/x, where x is the expected under no recombination. If normal is say 100, then F=(40-80)/80= (-40)/80=-0.5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps using relative plque densities.\n\nAnother approach: The expected plque density without recombination would be the average of plques on B and K. But that's not accurate. Instead, the presence of strain B promotes recombination, so the recombination frequency is calculated by looking at the proportion of recombinants. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination is occurring in the presence of B, which increases the likelihood of plque formation. The exact calculation requires knowing the base rate without recombination. Suppose without recombination, the expected plque density on B would be lower, say 20, making 40 plques an increase of 100%, suggesting complete recombination. But this seems high. Alternatively, if without recombination, plques on B are 20, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40 - 20)/20 = 1, which is 100% recombination. But that contradicts the observation that K still shows 4 plques, which is lower than normal.\n\nWait, maybe the base rate without recombination is 100 plques on B, and with recombination, it's 40. That implies a significant increase. Using the formula F = (observed - expected)/expected *100, it would be (40 -100)/100 *100 = -60%, which doesn't fit. Maybe the formula is adjusted for the direction of change.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination frequency can be estimated by comparing the plque densities. Since the lysogenic phage affects B, the recombination is happening there, thus increasing plques on B. The increase is from X to Y, which indicates recombination. The formula for recombination frequency in terms of plques is:\n\nF = (plque_on_B - plque_without_recombination)/plque_without_recombination\n\nAssuming without recombination, plques on B would be a certain number, say P. With recombination, plques on B are higher, say Q.

That suggests a very low recombination frequency. Wait, perhaps I got the formula wrong. Another formula is F = (observed - expected)/expected. For example, if without recombination, plques on B would be 100, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40 -100)/100 = -60%, which isn't right because F should be positive.\n\nMaybe the correct formula is F = (plque_on_B - plque_without_recombination)/plque_without_recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s take an example: if without recombination, plques on B are 100, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40 - 100)/100 = -60%, which doesn\u2019t fit. But if without recombination, it's 50, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40 -50)/50 = -20%, which is negative. That doesn\u2019t make sense either.\n\nPerhaps instead, the recombination frequency is determined by the ratio of plque counts. If without recombination, plques on B are 20, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = 40/20 = 200%, which is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the fraction of plques that are recombinants is considered.\n\nWait, let's think differently. The presence of strain B induces some level of recombination. If the lysogenic phage from B interacts with the K strain, it might form recombinants. The fraction of recombinants would depend on the recombination frequency. \n\nSuppose the recombination frequency is r. The number of recombinant plques would be proportional to r. Given that the lysogenic phage from B affects B more plausibly, the recombination frequency could be higher than expected without interactions.\n\nBut without precise numbers, it's hard to apply the formula directly. However, considering the options provided, 0.05% is the smallest, suggesting a very low recombination frequency. Alternatively, 0.02% is even smaller. \n\nLooking back at the experiment, the lysogenic phage from B affects B but not K. The increase in plques on B suggests that the two mutations are interacting, possibly increasing the likelihood of recombination. However, the decrease on K suggests that the interaction isn't strong enough to affect K, but stronger on B. This could imply a moderate level of recombination.\n\nBut the options suggest a very small percentage. Maybe the answer is E, 0.02 percent, indicating a very low recombination frequency.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't do anything, both phages don't cause any issues. \n\nThen, the bacteria are plated and divided into two groups. One group is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, resulting in some number of plques. The other group is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K, giving four plques on K and 40 on B. From these results, we're supposed to determine how much recombination there is between the two mutations.\n\nRecombination refers to the mixing of different alleles or mutations in the same gene locus. In this case, the two mutations are from different phages causing different fission methods. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis, only the non-lytic phage affects strain B. Strain K doesn't have either mutation, so no effect.\n\nThe experiment involves cross-inhibition and dilution effects. When you mix cells from two different strains, the cross-inhibition effect occurs if the two strains are compatible, meaning their replication machinery isn't interfering. If incompatible, the phages might replicate in each other's genome, leading to recombination.\n\nIn this case, the first group is a mixture of strain B and the lysogenic phage. It's diluted more heavily (1:10^7), so fewer plques would be expected without recombination. However, since only lysogenic phage affects B, plques should be low. The second group has a less concentrated mixture (1:10^5) and is placed on K, where neither mutation exists. So, without recombination, neither strain would respond favorably to the phage. But here, strain K responds better to the lysogenic phage than strain B, indicating some interaction.\n\nWait, actually, when the first group (strain B + lysogenic phage) is plated on strain B, it shouldn't produce any plques because the lysogenic phage doesn't affect B. But the problem states that the first group is divided equally between being plated on B and K? No, wait, the description says \"the resultingly saturated divided in half.\" Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting. Perhaps the initial division is into two equal parts, each part is then treated separately.\n\nSo, half the culture is plated on strain B and the other half on strain K. Each part is diluted at different concentrations. The first half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on B, while the second half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on K. Results show 40 plques on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage affected the B strain but not the K strain, implying that the two mutations interacted in the presence of strain B but not in K.\n\nIf there were no recombination, the lysogenic phage would affect both strains equally. But here, on B, it affects B, not K, so there must be some interaction. Recombination would mean that the lysogenic phage from B somehow affects the K strain, perhaps due to the presence of the lysogenic phage in B's environment.\n\nBut wait, in reality, recombination would typically lead to interference in one strain but not another unless specific conditions allow for it. Here, the lysogenic phage from B affects B but not K. This suggests that the two mutations interact in such a way that when the lysogenic phage is present in strain B, it affects its own replication in a way that also impacts strain K. \n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, we look at the ratio of recombinant plques to total plques. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage in strain B leads to a higher number of plques on B than usual. Normally, if there was no interaction, the plque density would depend on whether the phage affects the strain. But here, the phage affects B but not K, suggesting that the two mutations are interacting in a way that increases plque density in the presence of strain B.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency is F = (number of recombinant individuals)/(total individuals). But in terms of plques, it's similar. The observed plques on K are 4, and on B are 40. Assuming normal distribution, the expected plque density without recombination would be proportional to the probability of recombination. However, since the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination rate is higher when strain B is present.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of strain B allows the lysogenic phage to interact with the K strain, increasing the likelihood of recombination. To find the exact percentage, we might use the ratio of plques. The plque density on B is significantly higher, suggesting a higher likelihood of recombination. \n\nGiven that the lysogenic phage affects strain B but not K, the increase in plques on B compared to normal could indicate the degree of recombination. If normal plque density were around 100 per well, say, and on B it's 40, that's a reduction of 60%. On K, it's 4, which is about 10% of normal. The difference suggests that the recombination event increased plque density in B but didn't affect K as much.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, F = (Observed - Expected)/Expected. Without recombination, plques on B would be lower. Here, plques on B are higher, so F is positive. Calculating F = (40 - x)/x, where x is the expected under no recombination. If normal is say 100, then F=(40-80)/80= (-40)/80=-0.5, which doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps using relative plque densities.\n\nAnother approach: The expected plque density without recombination would be the average of plques on B and K. But that's not accurate. Instead, the presence of strain B promotes recombination, so the recombination frequency is calculated by looking at the proportion of recombinants. \n\nSince the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination is occurring in the presence of B, which increases the likelihood of plque formation. The exact calculation requires knowing the base rate without recombination. Suppose without recombination, the expected plque density on B would be lower, say 20, making 40 plques an increase of 100%, suggesting complete recombination. But this seems high. Alternatively, if without recombination, plques on B are 20, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40 - 20)/20 = 1, which is 100% recombination. But that contradicts the observation that K still shows 4 plques, which is lower than normal.\n\nWait, maybe the base rate without recombination is 100 plques on B, and with recombination, it's 40. That implies a significant increase. Using the formula F = (observed - expected)/expected *100, it would be (40 -100)/100 *100 = -60%, which doesn't fit. Maybe the formula is adjusted for the direction of change.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage affects B but not K, the recombination frequency can be estimated by comparing the plque densities.

Then F = (Q - P)/P.\n\nIf without recombination, plques on B are 20, and with recombination, it's 40, then F = (40-20)/20 = 100%.\n\nBut the options given are percentages like 0.05%.

Each plate is then diluted and plated onto separate bacterial cultures. The results show that half of each plate leads to a division (lysed), and further dilution gives different counts of pluses (bacterial colonies).\n\nLet me break down the data:\n\n- **First plate (lysogenic phage):**\n  - Diluted to 1/10^7 and plated on strain B.\n    - Results: 50 divisions (lysed).\n    - Then diluted to 1/10^5 and plated on strain K.\n      - Found 4 plasmid-free colonies (so lysed).\n      - And 40 plasmid-positive colonies (lysed).\n\n- **Second plate (wild-type phage):**\n  - Diluted to 1/10^7 and plated on strain B.\n    - Results: 0 divisions (lysed? Or maybe some died, but according to the problem, lysogenic phage in strain B does cause lytic fission, so it should die. Wait, no\u2014the first part says the lysogenic phage in strain B does something bad, causing lyosis (dies). So if you plate on strain B, the lysogenic phage would lyse and die, right? So why did the first plate have 50 divisions?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's clarify:\n\nIn the first scenario:\n- **Plate 1:** Lysogenic phage is used. It replicates inside E. coli, replicates without lysing (since it's lysogenic), replicates enough times to lyse the cell (so dies). So when you plate on strain B, all cells would be lysed, leading to 100% division. But the problem states that the first plate shows 50 divisions, meaning only half survived. That suggests that maybe the lysogenic phage isn't fully replicating or there's some mutation preventing full replication, perhaps during lysis.\n\nBut wait, the second plate uses the wild-type phage. Plating on strain K, which is resistant. Since the wild-type phage doesn't cause lysogeny (it's already lysogenic), it shouldn't lyse. So why does the first plate show 50 divisions when using the lysogenic phage on strain B?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up the roles here. Let's think again. The lysogenic phage is one type, and the wild-type is another. In the first case, when lysogenic is used on strain B, which is susceptible, it should lyse and die. So all cells should divide. But the problem says 50 divisions, which is half. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation where it sometimes doesn't lyse, but more likely, perhaps there's an error in how it replicates, like not replicating correctly, leading to half surviving. Alternatively, maybe it's a double-strand break repair issue, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being used on strain B, which is susceptible, and the mutation causes it not to lyse properly, but that would lead to death, not division. So maybe the mutation is such that it doesn't replicate as expected, leading to incomplete replication, thus only half survive.\n\nNow, considering the second plate, using the wild-type phage on strain K. If K is resistant, then the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide. But the problem states that when K is plated, 40 plasmid-positive colonies and 4 plasmid-free colonies are found. Wait, that adds up to 44 total. But the initial plate had 50 divisions (lysed), so why would there be 44 plating? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me correct my approach. The setup is that when a phage is used on E. coli strain B (which is susceptible), the lysogenic phage will lyse and die (so 100% division), while the wild-type phage won't lyse (so 0% division). However, the problem says that when using the lysogenic phage on strain B, only 50% of the cells divide (lysed). So perhaps the mutation in the lysogenic phage prevents full replication, leading to half surviving.\n\nThen, when using the wild-type phage on strain K (which is resistant), the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide. But the result is 4 plasmid-free and 40 plasmid-positive, totaling 44. This suggests that the number of cells is higher than expected, perhaps due to multiple plating events, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations affect whether the phage replicates and whether it causes lysis. Let me try to model this.\n\nAssume that when a phage is used on strain B (susceptible):\n- If the phage is lysogenic, it will replicate without lysing, so all cells should divide.\n- But due to a mutation, only half replicate, leading to 50% division.\n\nWhen using the same mutation on strain K (resistant):\n- Since K is resistant, the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide.\n\nHowever, the actual result is that when K is plated, 4 plasmid-positive and 40 plasmid-free colonies are observed. Totaling 44, which is less than 50. So perhaps the phage is replicating but not fully, or perhaps the phage is using a different mechanism, but given the context, it's more likely about mutations affecting replication and lysis.\n\nSo, the key is to determine the degree of recombination between the two mutations within the T_4 phage region. Recombination refers to the chance that one mutation affects replication while the other affects lysis, or vice versa.\n\nThe formula for calculating the probability of recombination (R) is R = p * q + r * s, where p and q are probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and r and s are their effects on replication and lysis.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with the proportion of plasmids positive at the time of lysis, which relates to the level of recombination. More recombination means more plasmids are present when the phage lyses.\n\nGiven that in the first case (lysis on strain B), 50% of cells are plasmid-free, and in the second case (lysis on strain K), 80% are plasmid-free (since 40 out of 44 are plasmid-positive). Wait, but the numbers add up to 44, which might mean that the sample size was adjusted, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nInstead, let's consider the expected distribution under normal conditions versus the observed distribution, which indicates the presence of recombination.\n\nIf there were no recombination (i.e., both mutations act on the same gene), then the proportion of plasmids positive would be determined solely by the mutation acting on replication. If there were complete recombination, the plasmid presence would depend on both mutations.\n\nGiven that in the lysogenic phage case on strain B, 50% are plasmid-free, and on strain K, 80% are plasmid-free, indicating that the recombination reduces the plasmid presence compared to the lysogenic phage alone.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequency of plasmids positive (if no recombination) would be based on the mutation rates. However, since we're dealing with a single locus, the presence of both mutations would reduce the likelihood of lysis, hence reducing the plasmid load upon lysis.\n\nThe formula to calculate the recombination coefficient (R) is R = (p + q - pq)/ (1 - pq), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, the relationship between the plasmid frequencies and the recombination fraction can help us find R.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the plasmid frequency (f) would be equal to the product of the replication and lysis efficiencies. But with recombination, the efficiency changes based on the combination of mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for recombinant fractions. The observed plasmid frequencies on strain K indicate the effect of recombination. The expectation without recombination would be a certain value, and the deviation from this expectation can be used to calculate R.\n\nFrom what I recall, the formula for recombinant frequency (R) when there's no interference is R = (f1 + f2 - f1f2)/(1 - f1f2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the probability of recombination is calculated based on the observed plasmid frequencies.\n\nIn our case, on strain B (without mutation), the lysogenic phage would lyse and kill all cells, so the plasmid frequency would be zero. On strain K, the lysogenic phage would lyse normally, so the plasmid frequency would be based on the mutation's replication and lysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of the expected plasmid frequency without recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the expected plasmid frequency would be based on their individual replication and lysis efficiencies.\n\nSuppose that the lysogenic phage has a replication efficiency of x and a lysis efficiency of y. Similarly, the wild-type phage has replication efficiency z and lysis efficiency w. However, since the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse, so w=0. The lysogenic phage replicates without lysis, so its replication efficiency is 100%, and lysis efficiency is 0%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it replicates perfectly (replication efficiency 100%), but it doesn't cause lysis (lysis efficiency 0%). Conversely, the wild-type phage doesn't replicate without lysis, so replication efficiency is 0% (no replication), and lysis efficiency is 100%.\n\nTherefore, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, which is susceptible, it will replicate perfectly, but not lyse, so all cells divide (plasmid-free). However, the problem states that 50% of cells divide, implying that the mutation somehow reduces replication. Therefore, perhaps the mutation is such that it reduces replication efficiency, say to 50%. But wait, if replication is reduced, then the lysogenic phage would replicate less, leading to fewer plasmids upon lysis.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so even if replication is reduced, the cells would still divide, just with fewer plasmids. So if the lysogenic phage's replication is reduced to 50%, then on replication, each cell has half the plasmids. But since the phage doesn't lyse, it would replicate and replicate again, leading to more plasmids. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's instead focus on the fact that the lysogenic phage on strain B leads to 50% plasmid-free, and on strain K, 80% plasmid-free. This suggests that the mutation in the lysogenic phage is partially responsible for reducing the plasmid presence, while the mutation in the wild-type phage may have no effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutation in the lysogenic phage affects replication, while the mutation in the wild-type phage affects lysis. But since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, the wild-type phage's mutation must affect replication.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the steps clearly:\n\n1. **First Experiment (Lysogenic Phage on Strain B):**\n   - All cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 50% division (lysed). So 50% plasmid-free, 50% plasmid-positive.\n\n2. **Second Experiment (Wild-Type Phage on Strain K):**\n   - Cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 4 plasmid-free, 40 plasmid-positive \u2192 44 total.\n   - Expected: Without mutation, all would divide (lysed). With mutation, the plasmid presence decreases.\n\n3. **Third Experiment (Wild-Type Phage on Strain B):**\n   - Cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 0 divisions (lysed?), but according to the problem statement, when using the lysogenic phage on strain B, only 50% divide, so when using wild-type on strain B, presumably none would divide. But the problem also mentions that when using lysogenic on strain B, 50% divide; when using wild-type on strain K, 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free. Wait, no, the third experiment isn't mentioned, but maybe it's implied.\n\nWait, actually, the user didn't describe the third experiment, but perhaps it's necessary to infer it. However, since the problem provides three experiments: two plates, each showing division on either side.\n\nWait, no, the problem describes three scenarios:\n\na. Two plates: one with lysogenic on strain B (resulting in half division), and one with wild-type on strain K (resulting in 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free).\n\nb. Another set of plates: one with wild-type on strain B (resulting in 0 divisions?), and one with lysogenic on strain K (resulting in 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free?).\n\nBut the original description stops there, so perhaps the third experiment isn't needed for solving the problem. Instead, the key is to use the data from the first two experiments to calculate the recombination fraction.\n\nNow, focusing back on the data:\n\n- **Strain B (lysis):** 50% plasmid-free, 50% plasmid-positive.\n- **Strain K (no lysis):** 80% plasmid-free, 20% plasmid-positive.\n\nThis suggests that the mutation in the lysogenic phage reduces the plasmid presence, while the mutation in the wild-type phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't affect replication but affects lysis. Wait, but the wild-type phage doesn't lyse, so its mutation would influence replication, not lysis. But since the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, which is resistant, the mutation in the lysogenic phage affects replication but not lysis. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B reduces the plasmid presence, while the presence of the wild-type phage on strain K doesn't change replication, but perhaps it's irrelevant because it doesn't lyse anyway.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when lysogenic is used on strain B, 50% divide; when wild-type on strain K, 40 plasmid-positive. Now, assuming that the wild-type phage doesn't lyse, so its mutation doesn't affect lysis, but affects replication. But since the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, which is resistant, the mutation in the lysogenic phage could affect replication, leading to lower plasmid presence upon lysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the two mutations are on the same gene, so recombination occurs. The recombination fraction is the probability that one mutation occurs before the other. The formula for the recombination fraction (R) is:\n\nR = (p + q - pq)/(1 - pq)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of one mutation and q is the frequency of the other.\n\nBut in our case, perhaps we can assume that the lysogenic phage mutation (let's call it mutation A) and the wild-type phage mutation (mutation B) are independent. The expected plasmid frequency on strain B (where mutation A affects replication) would be based on the replication and lysis efficiencies of mutation A. On strain K (where mutation B affects replication), the plasmid frequency would be based on the replication and lysis efficiencies of mutation B.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRecombinant frequency = (p + q - pq)/(1 - pq)\n\nBut in our case, the observed plasmid frequencies are:\n\n- Strain B: 50% plasmid-free.\n- Strain K: 80% plasmid-free.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected plasmid frequency without recombination would be:\n\n(Replication efficiency of A * Replication efficiency of B) / (1 - Lysis efficiency of A * Lysis efficiency of B))\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, the observed plasmid frequencies can be modeled as follows:\n\nOn strain B, the mutation A affects replication, reducing the plasmid loading. On strain K, mutation B affects replication, increasing the plasmid loading.\n\nWait, but in reality, mutation A is in the lysogenic phage, which doesn't lyse, so it affects replication. Mutation B is in the wild-type phage, which doesn't replicate without lysis, so it affects lysis.\n\nSo, perhaps the plasmid presence depends on the combined effect of both mutations. If mutation A is in the lysogenic phage, it affects replication, potentially reducing the plasmid count. If mutation B is in the wild-type phage, it affects lysis, possibly making more plasmids available upon lysis.\n\nThus, the overall plasmid presence would decrease due to both mutations working together. So, the observed plasmid frequencies are influenced by both mutations.\n\nTo calculate the recombination fraction, we can compare the observed plasmid frequencies to the expected frequencies under no recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the plasmid frequency on strain B would be based purely on mutation A's replication and lysis efficiency. Similarly, on strain K, based on mutation B's replication and lysis efficiency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- For mutation A (lysogenic phage):\n  - Replication efficiency: 100% (doesn't lyse)\n  - Lysis efficiency: e_A (unknown, but probably less than 1)\n\nFor mutation B (wild-type phage):\n- Replication efficiency: 0% (can\u2019t replicate without lysis)\n- Lysis efficiency: 100%\n\nSo, on strain B, when mutation A affects replication, the plasmid loading would be e_A. Thus, the expected plasmid frequency on strain B would be e_A.\n\nOn strain K, mutation B affects replication, so the plasmid loading would be 0% (since it can't replicate without lysis), but wait, that can't be right because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it can replicate infinitely until it reaches the carrying capacity. Hmm, this is getting too complex.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to realize that the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B reduces the plasmid count, while the presence of the wild",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which is resistant, both phages don't cause any issues. \n\nThe experiment involves two plates: one with the lysogenic phage and another with the wild-type (non-mutated) phage. Each plate is then diluted and plated onto separate bacterial cultures. The results show that half of each plate leads to a division (lysed), and further dilution gives different counts of pluses (bacterial colonies).\n\nLet me break down the data:\n\n- **First plate (lysogenic phage):**\n  - Diluted to 1/10^7 and plated on strain B.\n    - Results: 50 divisions (lysed).\n    - Then diluted to 1/10^5 and plated on strain K.\n      - Found 4 plasmid-free colonies (so lysed).\n      - And 40 plasmid-positive colonies (lysed).\n\n- **Second plate (wild-type phage):**\n  - Diluted to 1/10^7 and plated on strain B.\n    - Results: 0 divisions (lysed? Or maybe some died, but according to the problem, lysogenic phage in strain B does cause lytic fission, so it should die. Wait, no\u2014the first part says the lysogenic phage in strain B does something bad, causing lyosis (dies). So if you plate on strain B, the lysogenic phage would lyse and die, right? So why did the first plate have 50 divisions?\n\nWait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. Let's clarify:\n\nIn the first scenario:\n- **Plate 1:** Lysogenic phage is used. It replicates inside E. coli, replicates without lysing (since it's lysogenic), replicates enough times to lyse the cell (so dies). So when you plate on strain B, all cells would be lysed, leading to 100% division. But the problem states that the first plate shows 50 divisions, meaning only half survived. That suggests that maybe the lysogenic phage isn't fully replicating or there's some mutation preventing full replication, perhaps during lysis.\n\nBut wait, the second plate uses the wild-type phage. Plating on strain K, which is resistant. Since the wild-type phage doesn't cause lysogeny (it's already lysogenic), it shouldn't lyse. So why does the first plate show 50 divisions when using the lysogenic phage on strain B?\n\nHmm, maybe I'm mixing up the roles here. Let's think again. The lysogenic phage is one type, and the wild-type is another. In the first case, when lysogenic is used on strain B, which is susceptible, it should lyse and die. So all cells should divide. But the problem says 50 divisions, which is half. Maybe the lysogenic phage has a mutation where it sometimes doesn't lyse, but more likely, perhaps there's an error in how it replicates, like not replicating correctly, leading to half surviving. Alternatively, maybe it's a double-strand break repair issue, but that seems less likely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage is being used on strain B, which is susceptible, and the mutation causes it not to lyse properly, but that would lead to death, not division. So maybe the mutation is such that it doesn't replicate as expected, leading to incomplete replication, thus only half survive.\n\nNow, considering the second plate, using the wild-type phage on strain K. If K is resistant, then the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide. But the problem states that when K is plated, 40 plasmid-positive colonies and 4 plasmid-free colonies are found. Wait, that adds up to 44 total. But the initial plate had 50 divisions (lysed), so why would there be 44 plating? Hmm, maybe I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me correct my approach. The setup is that when a phage is used on E. coli strain B (which is susceptible), the lysogenic phage will lyse and die (so 100% division), while the wild-type phage won't lyse (so 0% division). However, the problem says that when using the lysogenic phage on strain B, only 50% of the cells divide (lysed). So perhaps the mutation in the lysogenic phage prevents full replication, leading to half surviving.\n\nThen, when using the wild-type phage on strain K (which is resistant), the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide. But the result is 4 plasmid-free and 40 plasmid-positive, totaling 44. This suggests that the number of cells is higher than expected, perhaps due to multiple plating events, but maybe I'm misinterpreting the numbers.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutations affect whether the phage replicates and whether it causes lysis. Let me try to model this.\n\nAssume that when a phage is used on strain B (susceptible):\n- If the phage is lysogenic, it will replicate without lysing, so all cells should divide.\n- But due to a mutation, only half replicate, leading to 50% division.\n\nWhen using the same mutation on strain K (resistant):\n- Since K is resistant, the phage doesn't lyse, so all cells should divide.\n\nHowever, the actual result is that when K is plated, 4 plasmid-positive and 40 plasmid-free colonies are observed. Totaling 44, which is less than 50. So perhaps the phage is replicating but not fully, or perhaps the phage is using a different mechanism, but given the context, it's more likely about mutations affecting replication and lysis.\n\nSo, the key is to determine the degree of recombination between the two mutations within the T_4 phage region. Recombination refers to the chance that one mutation affects replication while the other affects lysis, or vice versa.\n\nThe formula for calculating the probability of recombination (R) is R = p * q + r * s, where p and q are probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and r and s are their effects on replication and lysis.\n\nBut in this case, we're dealing with the proportion of plasmids positive at the time of lysis, which relates to the level of recombination. More recombination means more plasmids are present when the phage lyses.\n\nGiven that in the first case (lysis on strain B), 50% of cells are plasmid-free, and in the second case (lysis on strain K), 80% are plasmid-free (since 40 out of 44 are plasmid-positive). Wait, but the numbers add up to 44, which might mean that the sample size was adjusted, but perhaps I'm overcomplicating.\n\nInstead, let's consider the expected distribution under normal conditions versus the observed distribution, which indicates the presence of recombination.\n\nIf there were no recombination (i.e., both mutations act on the same gene), then the proportion of plasmids positive would be determined solely by the mutation acting on replication. If there were complete recombination, the plasmid presence would depend on both mutations.\n\nGiven that in the lysogenic phage case on strain B, 50% are plasmid-free, and on strain K, 80% are plasmid-free, indicating that the recombination reduces the plasmid presence compared to the lysogenic phage alone.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg principle, the expected frequency of plasmids positive (if no recombination) would be based on the mutation rates. However, since we're dealing with a single locus, the presence of both mutations would reduce the likelihood of lysis, hence reducing the plasmid load upon lysis.\n\nThe formula to calculate the recombination coefficient (R) is R = (p + q - pq)/ (1 - pq), but I might be misremembering. Alternatively, the relationship between the plasmid frequencies and the recombination fraction can help us find R.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the plasmid frequency (f) would be equal to the product of the replication and lysis efficiencies. But with recombination, the efficiency changes based on the combination of mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to use the formula for recombinant fractions. The observed plasmid frequencies on strain K indicate the effect of recombination. The expectation without recombination would be a certain value, and the deviation from this expectation can be used to calculate R.\n\nFrom what I recall, the formula for recombinant frequency (R) when there's no interference is R = (f1 + f2 - f1f2)/(1 - f1f2), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, the probability of recombination is calculated based on the observed plasmid frequencies.\n\nIn our case, on strain B (without mutation), the lysogenic phage would lyse and kill all cells, so the plasmid frequency would be zero. On strain K, the lysogenic phage would lyse normally, so the plasmid frequency would be based on the mutation's replication and lysis.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm complicating things. Let's think in terms of the expected plasmid frequency without recombination. If the two mutations are independent, the expected plasmid frequency would be based on their individual replication and lysis efficiencies.\n\nSuppose that the lysogenic phage has a replication efficiency of x and a lysis efficiency of y. Similarly, the wild-type phage has replication efficiency z and lysis efficiency w. However, since the phage is lysogenic, it doesn't lyse, so w=0. The lysogenic phage replicates without lysis, so its replication efficiency is 100%, and lysis efficiency is 0%.\n\nWait, that makes sense. The lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it replicates perfectly (replication efficiency 100%), but it doesn't cause lysis (lysis efficiency 0%). Conversely, the wild-type phage doesn't replicate without lysis, so replication efficiency is 0% (no replication), and lysis efficiency is 100%.\n\nTherefore, when the lysogenic phage is used on strain B, which is susceptible, it will replicate perfectly, but not lyse, so all cells divide (plasmid-free). However, the problem states that 50% of cells divide, implying that the mutation somehow reduces replication. Therefore, perhaps the mutation is such that it reduces replication efficiency, say to 50%. But wait, if replication is reduced, then the lysogenic phage would replicate less, leading to fewer plasmids upon lysis.\n\nWait, but the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so even if replication is reduced, the cells would still divide, just with fewer plasmids. So if the lysogenic phage's replication is reduced to 50%, then on replication, each cell has half the plasmids. But since the phage doesn't lyse, it would replicate and replicate again, leading to more plasmids. Wait, that doesn't make sense.\n\nMaybe I'm approaching this wrong. Let's instead focus on the fact that the lysogenic phage on strain B leads to 50% plasmid-free, and on strain K, 80% plasmid-free. This suggests that the mutation in the lysogenic phage is partially responsible for reducing the plasmid presence, while the mutation in the wild-type phage may have no effect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the mutation in the lysogenic phage affects replication, while the mutation in the wild-type phage affects lysis. But since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, the wild-type phage's mutation must affect replication.\n\nWait, I'm getting stuck. Let me try to outline the steps clearly:\n\n1. **First Experiment (Lysogenic Phage on Strain B):**\n   - All cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 50% division (lysed). So 50% plasmid-free, 50% plasmid-positive.\n\n2. **Second Experiment (Wild-Type Phage on Strain K):**\n   - Cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 4 plasmid-free, 40 plasmid-positive \u2192 44 total.\n   - Expected: Without mutation, all would divide (lysed). With mutation, the plasmid presence decreases.\n\n3. **Third Experiment (Wild-Type Phage on Strain B):**\n   - Cells should divide (lysed).\n   - Observed: 0 divisions (lysed?), but according to the problem statement, when using the lysogenic phage on strain B, only 50% divide, so when using wild-type on strain B, presumably none would divide. But the problem also mentions that when using lysogenic on strain B, 50% divide; when using wild-type on strain K, 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free. Wait, no, the third experiment isn't mentioned, but maybe it's implied.\n\nWait, actually, the user didn't describe the third experiment, but perhaps it's necessary to infer it. However, since the problem provides three experiments: two plates, each showing division on either side.\n\nWait, no, the problem describes three scenarios:\n\na. Two plates: one with lysogenic on strain B (resulting in half division), and one with wild-type on strain K (resulting in 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free).\n\nb. Another set of plates: one with wild-type on strain B (resulting in 0 divisions?), and one with lysogenic on strain K (resulting in 40 plasmid-positive and 4 plasmid-free?).\n\nBut the original description stops there, so perhaps the third experiment isn't needed for solving the problem. Instead, the key is to use the data from the first two experiments to calculate the recombination fraction.\n\nNow, focusing back on the data:\n\n- **Strain B (lysis):** 50% plasmid-free, 50% plasmid-positive.\n- **Strain K (no lysis):** 80% plasmid-free, 20% plasmid-positive.\n\nThis suggests that the mutation in the lysogenic phage reduces the plasmid presence, while the mutation in the wild-type phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't affect replication but affects lysis. Wait, but the wild-type phage doesn't lyse, so its mutation would influence replication, not lysis. But since the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, which is resistant, the mutation in the lysogenic phage affects replication but not lysis. Therefore, the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B reduces the plasmid presence, while the presence of the wild-type phage on strain K doesn't change replication, but perhaps it's irrelevant because it doesn't lyse anyway.\n\nWait, but the problem states that when lysogenic is used on strain B, 50% divide; when wild-type on strain K, 40 plasmid-positive. Now, assuming that the wild-type phage doesn't lyse, so its mutation doesn't affect lysis, but affects replication. But since the lysogenic phage is used on strain K, which is resistant, the mutation in the lysogenic phage could affect replication, leading to lower plasmid presence upon lysis.\n\nWait, perhaps the two mutations are on the same gene, so recombination occurs. The recombination fraction is the probability that one mutation occurs before the other. The formula for the recombination fraction (R) is:\n\nR = (p + q - pq)/(1 - pq)\n\nWhere p is the frequency of one mutation and q is the frequency of the other.\n\nBut in our case, perhaps we can assume that the lysogenic phage mutation (let's call it mutation A) and the wild-type phage mutation (mutation B) are independent. The expected plasmid frequency on strain B (where mutation A affects replication) would be based on the replication and lysis efficiencies of mutation A. On strain K (where mutation B affects replication), the plasmid frequency would be based on the replication and lysis efficiencies of mutation B.\n\nWait, perhaps another approach is to use the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRecombinant frequency = (p + q - pq)/(1 - pq)\n\nBut in our case, the observed plasmid frequencies are:\n\n- Strain B: 50% plasmid-free.\n- Strain K: 80% plasmid-free.\n\nAssuming that the two mutations are independent, the expected plasmid frequency without recombination would be:\n\n(Replication efficiency of A * Replication efficiency of B) / (1 - Lysis efficiency of A * Lysis efficiency of B))\n\nWait, this might get complicated. Alternatively, the observed plasmid frequencies can be modeled as follows:\n\nOn strain B, the mutation A affects replication, reducing the plasmid loading. On strain K, mutation B affects replication, increasing the plasmid loading.\n\nWait, but in reality, mutation A is in the lysogenic phage, which doesn't lyse, so it affects replication. Mutation B is in the wild-type phage, which doesn't replicate without lysis, so it affects lysis.\n\nSo, perhaps the plasmid presence depends on the combined effect of both mutations. If mutation A is in the lysogenic phage, it affects replication, potentially reducing the plasmid count. If mutation B is in the wild-type phage, it affects lysis, possibly making more plasmids available upon lysis.\n\nThus, the overall plasmid presence would decrease due to both mutations working together. So, the observed plasmid frequencies are influenced by both mutations.\n\nTo calculate the recombination fraction, we can compare the observed plasmid frequencies to the expected frequencies under no recombination.\n\nWithout recombination, the plasmid frequency on strain B would be based purely on mutation A's replication and lysis efficiency. Similarly, on strain K, based on mutation B's replication and lysis efficiency.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n\n- For mutation A (lysogenic phage):\n  - Replication efficiency: 100% (doesn't lyse)\n  - Lysis efficiency: e_A (unknown, but probably less than 1)\n\nFor mutation B (wild-type phage):\n- Replication efficiency: 0% (can\u2019t replicate without lysis)\n- Lysis efficiency: 100%\n\nSo, on strain B, when mutation A affects replication, the plasmid loading would be e_A. Thus, the expected plasmid frequency on strain B would be e_A.\n\nOn strain K, mutation B affects replication, so the plasmid loading would be 0% (since it can't replicate without lysis), but wait, that can't be right because the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, so it can replicate infinitely until it reaches the carrying capacity. Hmm, this is getting too complex.\n\nPerhaps a simpler way is to realize that the presence of the lysogenic phage on strain B reduces the plasmid count, while the presence of the wild",

Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occurred independently or together in the same phage.\n\nIn E. coli, if two mutations occur in the same gene (like the T_4 phage), the chance that one mutation comes before the other is 50%. If they are independent events, the probability that neither mutation occurs is 25% (since each has a 50% chance of occurring, and they're independent).\n\nLooking at the experiment results:\n- For the strain B lawn, the number of plques was higher than expected for a single mutation. Normally, if only one mutation occurs, you'd expect about 10 plques per million due to Poisson statistics. Here, we had 40 plques, which suggests either multiple plques per phage or some error. But more importantly, comparing the two groups:\n\nStrain B:\n- Diluted 1:10^7: Plated on strain B lawn. Expected ~10 plques if only lysogenic phage (recombinant) caused death. Actual was 40 plques, which seems too high unless multiple plques per phage were formed. Alternatively, maybe multiple phages died, leading to more plques.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up. Let me think again. When a phage causes lysis, it's a single event; if it causes death, it might die off completely, producing multiple plques. So, if both mutations happen, you could get more plques. Similarly, if only one mutation happens, fewer plques.\n\nBut in the case where both mutations are present, the chance that the lysogenic phage dies (due to recombination) would be lower, meaning more plques. Conversely, if neither mutation affects the phage, you'd have fewer plques.\n\nNow, looking at the dilutions:\n\nStrain B (with lysogenic phage):\n- Dilution factor 1:10^7: Plated on strain B lawn. Result: 40 plques.\n- Dilution factor 1:10^5: Plated on strain K lawn. Result: 4 plques.\n\nThis suggests that the presence of the lysogenic phage (which causes recombination) leads to increased plque formation, whereas the absence of lysogenic phage reduces plque formation. This supports the idea that the mutations are occurring within the same phage.\n\nTo calculate recombination frequency, the formula used is:\n\nRecomb_freq = ln(P/(P-1)) * 100%\n\nWhere P is the probability that both mutations occur in the same phage. Wait, no, actually, another approach is needed. Maybe using the ratio of plques from the two dilutions.\n\nWhen a phage with both recombinants is present, it will produce more plques because both mutations affect its replication. In contrast, a phage with one mutation (either lysogenic or recombination) will replicate less efficiently, leading to fewer plques.\n\nThe observed plques can help determine how many times each mutation contributed to the outcome. However, without knowing the exact distribution, we can use an approximate method.\n\nFrom the data:\n- On strain B, 40 plques were seen, which is much higher than expected for a single mutation. This suggests that the lysogenic phage (with recombination) is causing more issues.\n- On strain K, only 4 plques were seen. Since strain K doesn't have the lysogenic phage (as it's resistant), the only issue comes from the lysogenic phage, which didn't cause recombination here.\n\nThus, the presence of the lysogenic phage (and possibly recombination) increases plque formation, while the absence decreases it. To quantify recombination, we can consider the likelihood that a phage carries both mutations.\n\nIf the recombination frequency (rf) is low, say 0.05%, then most phages carry only one mutation, leading to fewer plques. Higher rf means more phages carry both, leading to more plques.\n\nUsing the example given, the increase in plques on strain B compared to what would be expected without any phage (assuming all phages are wild-type) is a key indicator.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plques on the two dilutions can give us an estimate. On the first dilution (1:10^7), we saw 40 plques, and on the second (1:10^5), 4 plques. The difference in plques between these dilutions can indicate how much recombination happened.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency based on plque counts is:\n\nln((P1)/(P2)) \u2248 -100 * rf\n\nWhere P1 is the plque count under the first dilution, and P2 under the second.\n\nHere, P1=40, P2=4.

To quantify recombination, we can consider the likelihood that a phage carries both mutations.\n\nIf the recombination frequency (rf) is low, say 0.05%, then most phages carry only one mutation, leading to fewer plques. Higher rf means more phages carry both, leading to more plques.\n\nUsing the example given, the increase in plques on strain B compared to what would be expected without any phage (assuming all phages are wild-type) is a key indicator.\n\nAlternatively, the ratio of plques on the two dilutions can give us an estimate. On the first dilution (1:10^7), we saw 40 plques, and on the second (1:10^5), 4 plques. The difference in plques between these dilutions can indicate how much recombination happened.\n\nThe formula for calculating recombination frequency based on plque counts is:\n\nln((P1)/(P2)) \u2248 -100 * rf\n\nWhere P1 is the plque count under the first dilution, and P2 under the second.\n\nHere, P1=40, P2=4. So,\n\nln(40/4) = ln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nThen,\n\n2.3026 \u2248 -100 * rf\n\nSolving for rf:\n\nrf \u2248 -2.3026 / 100 \u2248 0.023026%\n\nWhich rounds to approximately 0.02%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option I is 0.02 percent, and option J is 0.05 percent.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer).

    "rollout": " But when both phages are present, half of the colonies die, then get diluted into a lawn of strain B and another half into a lawn of strain K. \n\nThe key points from the experiment are:\n- Half of the initial population dies when both phages are present.\n- These dying plasmids are then diluted 1:10^7 into a strain B lawn.\n- The other half dilutes into a strain K lawn, resulting in 4 pluses on K and 40 on B.\n\nNow, let's break down what recombination means here. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. If there's no recombination, each mutation would act independently. If there's full recombination, they perfectly interact, causing lethality or specific effects.\n\nIn the experiment, when both phages are present, only half of the cells survive. This suggests that the presence of both mutants reduces the survival rate significantly. In E. coli strain B, the death occurs because the lysogenic phage is active, but in strain K, maybe the phage isn't as effective? Or perhaps the recombination affects how the phage integrates into the bacterial chromosome.\n\nWait, actually, since the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis, its presence should lead to cell death regardless of integration. So why did the death occur only in some cases?\n\nLet me think about the possible outcomes. Without any recombination, each mutation would have an independent effect. But with recombination, the phage might integrate at different sites, affecting whether it causes lysis or not. However, in this case, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause lysis even if integrated elsewhere, right? Because lysogenic phages typically integrate near the replication origin and cause replication without lysis.\n\nSo the death observed in strain B probably happens due to the lysogenic phage integrating at a site where it doesn't cause lysis. Now, looking at the experiment, when both phages are present, half the cells die. That suggests that the presence of both mutants halves the survival rate. Since each mutation individually could kill more cells, having two kills would make it worse.\n\nBut wait, actually, each mutation has a certain probability of causing lysis. For example, if a lysogenic phage integrates at a site where it doesn't cause lysis, it will replicate normally, so the cell won't lyse. However, if it integrates elsewhere, it may cause lysis. Similarly, the non-lysogenic phage might not cause lysis either depending on where it integrates.\n\nAssuming that each mutation (lysogenic and lysogenic) has a certain chance of causing lysis, the combined effect depends on their interaction. Full recombination would mean that both mutations are present at the same site, making lysis impossible for both. No recombination would mean each mutation acts independently.\n\nIn the experiment, when both are present, half the cells die. That suggests that the combined effect of both mutations leads to a 50% reduction in survival. Let's model this. Suppose each mutation independently has a 50% chance of killing the cell (for simplicity). Then the probability of neither killing is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 (25%), which doesn't match the 50% observed. Alternatively, if one mutation always causes lysis (e.g., lysogenic) and the other doesn't, then half the cells would die. But that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, considering recombination, suppose that in normal conditions, each mutation has a certain probability. With recombination, the probabilities combine. If both mutations cause lysis, the cell dies; otherwise, it survives. The observed survival is 50%, meaning 50% of cells survived. So the probability of death is 50%.\n\nIf we assume that each mutation has a certain recombination fraction, say r, then the overall recombination fraction would affect the combined probability. Assuming that each mutation alone has a certain survival rate, and together they multiply.\n\nWait, let's consider that each mutation has a certain survival probability. For the lysogenic phage (non-lytic), let\u2019s say s_l = survival rate without recombination. For the lysogenic phage (lytic), s_p = survival rate. If there's no recombination, the total survival is s_l * s_p.\n\nWhen both are present, the survival rate becomes s_l * s_p' + s_l' * s_p - correction for double-counting. Wait, perhaps it's better to model it as:\n\nWithout recombination: S = s_l * s_p.\n\nWith recombination, S' = s_l * s_p' + s_l' * s_p'' - overlap.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach: Each mutation has a certain number of plasmids that can cause lysis. If they recombine, the number of plasmids that cause lysis changes.\n\nSuppose that without recombination, the lysogenic phage carries a certain number of plasmid copies that, upon integration, cause lysis. Let\u2019s denote c_l as the number of plasmid copies that, when integrated, cause lysis. Similarly, c_p for the lysogenic phage.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the probability that a cell survives is (1 - c_l / m)^{c_l} * (1 - c_p / m)^{c_p}, assuming m is the total number of potential sites. But this might be getting too complex.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each mutation has a certain survival rate. Let's say that the lysogenic phage (without recombination) has a survival rate of p, and the lysogenic phage (with recombination) also has the same survival rate. Then, when both are present, the survival rate is p * q, where q is the survival rate when the lysogenic phage is present along with the non-lytic phage.\n\nBut according to the experiment, when both phages are present, half the cells die. That implies that the survival rate is 50%. So, p * q = 0.5. But without knowing p and q, it's hard to proceed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that each mutation independently has a 50% chance of being present. If there's complete recombination, then both mutations must be present, leading to 25% survival (if each has 50% chance of being present). But that contradicts the observation of 50% survival.\n\nWait, maybe it's the opposite. If each mutation has a 50% chance of being present, then the probability that both are present is 25%. But in our case, when both are present, the survival is 50%. So 25% of the time, you have both mutations, and that leads to 50% survival. Hmm, maybe not directly applicable.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to use the formula for the expected number of deaths. The expected number of dead cells when both phages are present is N * (probability of death).\n\nFrom the experiment: Total cells = N, died = N/2, diluted into strain B, and died = N/40 into strain K.\n\nWait, actually, the problem states that when both phages are present, half the colonies die. These die plasmids are then diluted 1:10^7 into a strain B lawn and 1:10^5 into a strain K lawn.\n\nThen, four pluses are found on K and 40 on B. So, in the strain B lawn, the surviving plasmids were diluted into 1:10^7, and 40 plasmids resulted in four plasmids per cell. Wait, no, actually, the number of plasmids per cell determines the number of colonies. If you dilute the plasmids 1:10^7, then each cell now has fewer plasmids. Similarly, 1:10^5.\n\nBut perhaps the key is that the number of plasmids per cell corresponds to the number of colonies. For example, if you have x plasmids per cell, and you dilute them further, the number of plasmids in the final culture is x * (dilution factor). For instance, if you dilute into 1:10^7, then each cell now has x * 10^-7 plasmids.\n\nWait, but plasmid numbers are usually counted per cell, not multiplied by dilution factors. So, perhaps it's easier to think in terms of plasmid density before dilution.\n\nIn the first dilution, the plasmids are diluted 1:10^7 into strain B. Then, 40 plasmids are found in K. That suggests that after dilution, the density was such that 40 plasmids correspond to four cells, implying each cell had 10 plasmids. Because 40 plasmids over 40 cells would give 1 plasmid per cell, but that's confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps it's better to think that after diluting, the number of plasmids per cell is such that when plated on a lawn, each colony represents the number of plasmids per cell. So, if you plate on a lawn, the number of colonies equals the number of plasmids per cell. Therefore, if you have 40 plasmids in the K sample, that means each cell had 10 plasmids (because 40 plasmids spread across 4 cells gives 10 per cell). Similarly, 4 plmas on B would mean 0.1 plasmids per cell.\n\nThis suggests that the initial dilutions reduced the plasmid density enough to create a plasmid concentration that, when plated on a lawn, results in 4 plasmids per cell or 0.1 per cell.\n\nSo, initially, the plasmids were diluted 1:10^7 into strain B. After that, they were plated on a lawn, and 40 plasmids were found. That implies that before dilution, the plasmid concentration was 40 * 10^7 plasmids/mL, because when you dilute 1:10^7, the concentration increases by 10^7 times. Wait, actually, no. Dilution affects the plasmid concentration inversely. So, if you dilute 1:10^7, the concentration goes up by 10^7. So, if after dilution, you have C plasmids/mL, before dilution it was C * 10^7.\n\nGiven that, in the K sample, 40 plasmids were found. So before dilution, it was 40 * 10^7 = 4 * 10^9 plasmids/mL. Similarly, in the B sample, 4 plasmids were found after dilution, so before dilution, it was 4 * 10^7 plasmids/mL.\n\nNow, these concentrations correspond to the recombination level. If the recombination fraction is high, the plasmid concentration would be lower because recombination disrupts the linkage between the lysogenic phage and the chromosome. Lower plasmid concentration would mean less recombination.\n\nWait, but higher recombination leads to more disruption, so lower plasmid density. So, the difference in plasmid densities between K and B samples indicates the difference in recombination levels.\n\nIn K, the plasmid concentration was 4 * 10^9, and in B, it was 4 * 10^7. That's a tenfold decrease. So, the ratio is 100 times lower in B compared to K. If this corresponds to a change in recombination frequency, we can relate it to the amount of recombination.\n\nThe relationship between recombination frequency and plasmid density can be approximated using the formula for heterozygosity in bacteria, H = 2p(1-p), where p is the proportion of recombinant alleles. However, plasmid density relates to the degree of recombination disruption.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to recognize that the difference in plasmid density reflects the difference in recombination. If the plasmid density in strain K is 100 times higher than in strain B, that suggests that recombination occurred more effectively in strain K, i.e., less recombination in B.\n\nTo quantify this, we can assume that the recombination fraction (R) is related to the plasmid density. Let\u2019s denote R as the fraction of plasmids that are intact. If R is low (no recombination), the plasmid density is high. Conversely, if R is high (full recombination), the plasmid density decreases.\n\nAssuming a linear relationship, the plasmid density D is proportional to (1 - R). So, D_B = D_K * (1 - R_K/R_B). Wait, no, that might not be correct. Let's think differently.\n\nIf R_K > R_B, then D_K </think>\nThe correct answer is C",

In phages, if the two mutation sites are recombined, then both mutants might cause issues. But since only lysogenic phages affect B, perhaps there's no recombination between the two mutants.\n\nLet me think about how the results would look for recombination. If the mutations were recombined, then both mutants could cause issues. So in the B lawn, which only has lysogenic phages, you'd expect more issues than just the lysogenic one alone. Similarly, on the K lawn, which has lysogenic and possibly recombined mutants, you'd see more issues.\n\nBut wait, in the given data, the lysogenic phage only affects B, and recombination isn't happening because the other phages don't affect either strain. So maybe there's no recombination, meaning the mutations are independent.\n\nAnother approach is to calculate the expected number of recombinants. Each parent can produce up to four recombinants if considering double-strand breaks, but I'm not sure if that applies here. Alternatively, the presence of multiple mutants suggests that they might have recombined, but without any observed effect on either strain, it's hard to say.\n\nWait, looking at the dilutions: 1:10^7 on B and 1:10^5 on K. Since K is a different strain, any recombination wouldn't affect it directly. But the fact that K shows 40 pluses and B shows 4 suggests that the presence of the recombination event increases the number of pluses. However, since neither strain shows issues, maybe recombination isn't occurring.\n\nAlternatively, if there was recombination, we might expect both strains to show more issues. But in the data, only B shows issues, so recombination must be zero. Therefore, the recombination rate is zero.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

One plate has the lysogenic phage with strain B, and the other has the lysogenic phage with strain K. After incubation, the results show that half the colonies are destroyed on each plate. Then these are further treated with a lawn plate of strain B and K respectively.\n\nFrom the data:\n- On the first plate (lytic with B), there are 40 pluses (lytic fission).\n- On the second plate (lysogenic with K), there are 4 pluses.\n- The total plasmid count from the initial plates would be 40 + 4 = 44, meaning each original phage was diluted to half the concentration in the final culture.\n\nWait, no. Actually, each initial phage is present at a certain concentration, and when you dilute them, you're adding more or less of the phage DNA. If you mix equal volumes, the concentration halves, so the number of phages per well becomes double if you started with equal concentrations. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet's think differently. Each original phage is present in a certain concentration, say N. When you dilute them equally, you add an equal volume of the same concentration. So the total concentration becomes 2N. Therefore, the number of phages per well doubles when you dilute equally. That makes sense because you have twice as much solution, but since the concentration is doubled, each well has twice as many phages.\n\nSo for example, if you had 10 phages initially, after dilution, you'd have 20 phages per well. So the number of phages per well is doubled when you dilute equally.\n\nNow, looking back at the problem:\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage (causing lytic fission) is placed in strain B, all its copies lead to lytic fission, leading to division. In strain K, it leads to lysogenic fission without division. So when you plate the lysogenic phage in strain B, all the colonies will divide (plus signs). In strain K, none will divide (no pluses).\n\nBut wait, the results showed that in the lysogenic vs. lysogenic case, some were lysogenic and others were not? No, actually, when you plate lysogenic phages on strain B, all of them lyse, so the colonies are fully lysesable. On strain K, the lysogenic phages don't lyse, so the colonies aren't lysable. Similarly, if you plate lysogenic on strain B, they lyse; if you plate lysogenic on K, they don't.\n\nBut according to the data given, on the first plate (lytic with B), the result was 40 pluses, meaning 40 colonies were lysisable. On the second plate (lytic with K), the result was 4 pluses, meaning 4 colonies were lysisable. Then these are treated with K and B lawn plates, resulting in 40 pluses on K and 4 on B.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the treatment. When the colonies are treated with a lawn of K, any colony that forms a plasmid copy number exceeding 50% will lyse, right? Because in a lawn, if the copy number exceeds 50%, the phage will lyse. So the number of plasmids detected depends on whether the copy number in each colony is above 50%.\n\nSo, let's clarify:\n\nIn the initial experiment:\n\n- Lysogenic phage (causing lytic fission) is placed in strain B. All phages lyse, so all colonies are fully lysisable (plated on K lawn, all plasmids detectable, 40 pluses).\n- Lysogenic phage is also placed in strain K, causing non-lytic fission. These phages do not lyse, so colonies are not lysisable (plated on B lawn, no plasmids detected, 0 pluses).\n\nThen these are treated with media plates of strain B and K respectively. However, the next step says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the treated plates (with lysogenic phages) are then plated on strain B lawn, and similarly for K.\n\nWait, but the initial treatment already led to plasmids being either over 50% or not. So treating them again might not change anything unless the copy numbers are still too high. But the key point is that the presence of plasmids depends on the copy number relative to 50%.\n\nGiven that, we can model the process using the Hardy-Weinberg principle for recombinant events in phage genotypes. Since the mutation is recombination between the two phage types, the frequency of the mutated phages depends on how often they recombine during replication.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phages are heterozygous (Ll), where L is the lysogenic allele and l is the lytic allele. When they replicate, they form LL and ll gametes. The fraction of cells expressing LL (lytic fission) is determined by the probability of recombination during replication. Normally, recombination occurs with probability p, so the fraction of cells with LL is (1 - p)^2, and with ll is p^2.\n\nHowever, in our case, the lysogenic phages are causing either full lysis or partial lysis. Since in strain B, all lysogenic phages lyse (so all cells express LL), while in strain K, only the lysogenic phages do not lyse (so only the LL phages do not lyse, and the ll phages lyse).\n\nThis suggests that the lysogenic phage in strain B has a higher chance of being in the LL genotype, whereas in strain K, the phage is in the Ll genotype because it does not lyse (only LL phages lyse, which are the ones that were recombined and pass the L allele on).\n\nWait, no. Let me think again. If the lysogenic phage is in a heterozygote (Ll), during replication, they can form LL and ll gametes. The frequency of LL is (1 - r)^2 and ll is r^2, where r is the rate of recombination. \n\nIf in strain B, all lysogenic phages lyse, that implies that all cells express LL, meaning that all the phages must have been in the LL genotype. Therefore, the frequency of LL is 100%. This would imply that there is zero recombination, because if there was any recombination, some cells would express ll.\n\nSimilarly, in strain K, only the lysogenic phages do not lyse, implying that only the LL phages do not lyse. But since the phages are in the Ll genotype, they should lyse if they produce phages with the l allele. Wait, no, in the Ll genotype, during replication, they form LL and ll phages. The phage with the l allele (ll) would lyse upon replication, causing a reduction in the population. \n\nTherefore, in strain K, the lysogenic phages are in the Ll genotype, and when they lyse, they release phage particles containing the l allele. These phages are then washed away, reducing the population. Meanwhile, the LL phages lyse normally, releasing phage particles with the L allele. So the population would remain mostly at the L allele, except when the phages lyse.\n\nWait, but in the experiment, the result was that only the lysogenic phages caused lysis. So in strain B, all lysogenic phages lyse, meaning that all phages are in the LL genotype, indicating no recombination. In strain K, only the lysogenic phages do not lyse, meaning that the phages are in the Ll genotype, but those that lyse release the l allele, and the ones that don't lyse release the L allele. So the population remains mostly at the L allele.\n\nBut the data shows that on the first plate (lytic with B), 40 pluses occurred, which correspond to the L allele being maintained. On the second plate (lytic with K), 4 pluses occurred, corresponding to the l allele being lost. \n\nAfterward, these colonies are plated on strain B and K lawn plates. The K lawn plate detects 40 pluses, meaning that in the K lawn, all the colonies expressed the L allele (since the phages were in the Ll genotype, and the l allele was lost). The B lawn plate detected 4 pluses, meaning that in the B lawn, the phages were in the LL genotype, so all the alleles were L.\n\nTherefore, this indicates that there was no recombination between the two mutations. Because if there was recombination, some of the phages would have the l allele and lyse, disrupting the population in strain K, thus decreasing the number of pluses detected on the K lawn plate. \n\nSo, in terms of recombination frequency, if there were any recombination, the number of pluses on the K lawn plate would be lower than 40, but in this case, it's exactly 40. Therefore, there is no recombination between the two mutations, meaning the recombination frequency is 0%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

    "rollout": " But when they're mixed together, both types cause some division, which might lead to more cells being affected.\n\nThe experiment involves plates where strain B is infected first. Two types of mutantphages are used simultaneously. After incubation, the population is split into two halves: one is dilated 1:10^7 (so 1% of the original population), and the other is dilated 1:10^5 (which is 0.1%). These two groups are then plated onto separate litters of E. coli strain B and another strain K.\n\nThe key observation here is that four pluses were found on the K-litter, and 40 were found on the B-litter. Plaques indicate successful infection, meaning the phage successfully integrated into the bacterial chromosome and caused division or replication.\n\nI remember that when two mutations are present in a gene, their combination affects the phenotype. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), each mutation would have a certain effect. However, if there's partial recombination, one mutation's effect is masked by the presence of the other.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing division, while the lytic phage does. So the presence of lysogenic phages must be linked to certain regions that allow them to replicate without dividing. This suggests that the lysogenic phage uses an integration site that's present in the lysogenic phage but not in the lytic phage.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think it's the opposite. The lysogenic phage integrates into the chromosome at a specific site, allowing it to replicate without division. The lytic phage doesn't integrate and instead replicates the entire chromosome, leading to cell division and possibly lysogeny.\n\nSo if you have both types of phages, the lysogenic phage will integrate, causing issues, while the lytic phage won't integrate but will replicate the entire chromosome, leading to cell divisions. So the presence of lysogenic phages is necessary for the issue observed, implying that the lysogenic phage has its own integration site.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during the replication process. In this context, it's about whether the integration sites are present in the same locus.\n\nIf there's complete recombination, one copy of the phage would integrate and the other wouldn't. If no recombination occurs, neither would integrate. So the number of successful infections depends on whether the phages are integrating and replicating correctly.\n\nLooking back at the problem, when both types of phages are present, only the lysogenic phage does something bad. That means that the lysogenic phage integrates and allows replication without division, while the lytic phage doesn't integrate and thus replicates the entire chromosome, causing cell division.\n\nNow, the experimental results involve mixing two types of phages. The presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the lysogenic phage was able to replicate without division, which requires that the phage's integration site is present and functional. Conversely, the lytic phage didn't replicate without division, suggesting that the lysogenic phage had an integration site that allowed it to replicate without dividing.\n\nThis implies that the lysogenic phage shares a different integration site than the lytic phage. Therefore, the two mutations (integrase presence or absence) are located at different loci. \n\nWhen calculating recombination frequency, we look at how often the integration sites are shared between the two phages. Since the lysogenic phage uses a different integration site, there is zero recombination between them. But wait, that seems too simplistic.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of the lysogenic phage in the mix leads to its ability to replicate without division, indicating that the lysogenic phage has its own integration site. If the lysogenic phage can replicate without division, it suggests that it carries a unique integration site. Similarly, the lytic phage doesn't replicate without division, implying that the lysogenic phage is the one that doesn't integrate, or maybe that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site.\n\nHmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me approach this differently. The key is determining the proportion of times the phages integrate such that the lysogenic phage can replicate without division. If the lysogenic phage can do that, it must have an integration site that allows replication without dividing, while the lytic phage lacks this site.\n\nTherefore, the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that there is at least one integration site present. If both phages have the same integration site, there would be full recombination. If they don't share any integration sites, there is no recombination.\n\nSince only the lysogenic phage causes the issue, it suggests that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site from the lytic phage. Thus, there is no recombination between them\u2014no point of sharing a locus where their integrations occur.\n\nHowever, sometimes experiments show that even with different integration sites, there might still be some degree of recombination due to random events during replication. But in this case, since the lysogenic phage can replicate without division, it likely did not undergo recombination; the lysogenic phage already has its own integration site.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency would be zero, meaning there's no recombination between the two mutations. But looking at the options provided:\n\nA. 1 percent  \nB. 2 percent  \nC. 1.5 percent  \nD. 0.1 percent  \nE. 0.02 percent  \nF. 0.3 percent  \nG. 0.5 percent  \nH. 5 percent  \nI. 0.02 percent  \nJ. 0.05 percent  \n\nNone of these options is zero. Maybe I misunderstood the setup. Perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the lysogenic phage cannot integrate properly, but that doesn't make sense because lysogenic phages typically use their own integration sites.\n\nWait, another angle: the number of plasmids formed from each group. The first group (diluted 1:10^7) would form fewer plasmids, as each phage would produce a few plasmids. The second group (diluted 1:10^5) forms more plasmids. If the lysogenic phage integrates without needing to carry extra plasmids, then the higher concentration might mean more plasmid loss or retention.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that directly relates to recombination. Alternatively, the fact that the lysogenic phage can replicate without division suggests that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site than the lytic phage. Therefore, there is no recombination between them.\n\nIf there's no recombination, the expected number of plasmids from each group should be similar, assuming equal numbers of phages. However, in the experiment, the first group resulted in fewer plasmids, and the second group had more. This could suggest that the lysogenic phage integrated and replicated without additional plasmids, while the lytic phage replicated with plasmids, leading to more plasmid loss or retention.\n\nBut again, I'm not sure how this ties back to recombination frequency. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it. If there's no recombination, the recombination frequency is zero. But since all options except D and E are positive percentages, perhaps there's a misinterpretation.\n\nWait, let me think differently. Suppose that the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site, leading to incomplete recombination. If there was some recombination, it might explain why the lysogenic phage can replicate without division, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering the possibility of double-stranded DNA repair errors or other mechanisms affecting replication. But this is speculative.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to calculate the expected number of successful infections based on recombination frequency. If there's no recombination, the lysogenic phage shouldn't replicate without division. If there's some recombination, it might influence the outcome.\n\nWait, but in this case, the lysogenic phage does replicate without division, which suggests no recombination occurred. Because if there was recombination, the lysogenic phage would have lost its ability to replicate without division.\n\nGiven that, the recombination frequency is zero. But none of the answer choices are zero. This makes me think that perhaps my initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nMaybe the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the lysogenic phage integrates but doesn't require the same machinery, leading to some duplication. Or perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages affects the recombination rate somehow.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the presence of lysogenic phages increases the likelihood of recombination. If the lysogenic phage has a different integration site, perhaps the chance of recombination increases slightly. But I'm not sure how much that would affect the outcome.\n\nWait, going back to the experiment: the first group (1:10^7 dilution) had 4 plasmids, and the second group (1:10^5 dilution) had 40 plasmids. The total number of plasmids after dilution is proportional to the number of phages.\n\nAssuming each phage produces a certain number of plasmids upon replication, the number of plasmids in each group reflects the number of phages. The first group has fewer plasmids, meaning fewer phages, which aligns with lower dilution factor.\n\nIf there's recombination, some of the lysogenic phages would have integrated and replicated without division, contributing to more plasmids. The non-integrating lysogenic phages would replicate normally, adding more plasmids. The lytic phages would replicate normally, but without the lysogenic ones.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phages are the ones that replicate without division, so their presence increases the number of plasmids. The lytic phages, having fully integrated, add more plasmids as well. The non-integrating lysogenic phages add fewer plasmids compared to integrating ones.\n\nBut without knowing the exact mechanism, it's hard to say. However, the key point is that the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that there is at least one integration site available, suggesting no recombination.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency should be zero, which isn't among the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is H (5%) or G (0.5%), but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the calculation considers the actual number of plasmids and infers recombination.\n\nAnother approach: calculate the expected number of successful infections based on recombination frequency. If recombination occurs, some plasmids may come from non-recombined phages, reducing the success rate.\n\nLet\u2019s assume that if there's no recombination (0%), all lysogenic phages integrate and replicate without division, leading to maximum success. If there's recombination (say, r%), the probability of lysogenic phages replicating without division decreases.\n\nGiven that, the expected number of successful plasmids would depend on r%. The observed data shows that the first group (dilution 1:10^7) had 4 plasmids, and the second group (dilution 1:10^5) had 40 plasmids. \n\nTo find r%, we can set up equations based on expected values. Let\u2019s denote r as the recombination frequency (percentage).\n\nTotal number of phages in each group before dilution:\n- First group: N = 4 x 10^7 (since it's 1:10^7 dilution)\n- Second group: M = 4 x 10^6 (since it's 1:10^5 dilution)\n\nAfter dilution, the number of phages per group remains the same.\n\nExpected number of successful plasmids would be proportional to (N + M) * (1 - r/100). Wait, no, perhaps it's better to model it as the number of phages that successfully replicate without division.\n\nEach lysogenic phage contributes to the increase in plasmids via integration and subsequent replication without division. Non-integrating lysogenic phages do not replicate without division, so they contribute less plasmids.\n\nBut without precise formulas, it's challenging to derive r%.\n\nAlternatively, given that the first group had fewer plasmids and the second group had many, it suggests that the lysogenic phages in the second group replicated without division, which implies that there was some level of recombination.\n\nWait, but earlier reasoning suggested no recombination. Maybe the presence of lysogenic phages indicates that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site, which might imply some recombination occurred. For example, if the lysogenic phage shares a different integration site, it might experience some recombination with the host, making it possible to replicate without division.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is J (0.05%) or F (0.3%).\n\nAlternatively, considering that the difference in plasmid counts (from 4 to 40) might correspond to a certain recombination percentage. But without a clear formula, it's hard to estimate.\n\nGiven the confusion, I'll go with the most straightforward interpretation: since only lysogenic phages cause division without splitting, there's no recombination occurring. Therefore, the recombination frequency is zero, which is not an option. Hence, perhaps the closest answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%). But these are very low percentages.\n\nAlternatively, if the presence of lysogenic phages suggests that the lysogenic phage has a different integration site, which might be partially recombined, perhaps at a small rate. But without concrete evidence, it's difficult to assign a precise value.\n\nConsidering the options, perhaps the intended answer is I (0.02%) or J (0.05%). However, since the exact calculations aren't yielding a clear path, I might lean towards the highest possible option, which is F (0.3%).\n\nBut honestly, I'm not entirely sure. My best guess is that the recombination frequency is zero, but since that's not an option, I might consider the closest plausible answer, which could be J (0.05%) or I (0.02%). Without further information, I'll go with I (0.02%) as the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they're mixed together, both types cause some division, which might lead to more cells being affected.\n\nThe experiment involves plates where strain B is infected first. Two types of mutantphages are used simultaneously. After incubation, the population is split into two halves: one is dilated 1:10^7 (so 1% of the original population), and the other is dilated 1:10^5 (which is 0.1%). These two groups are then plated onto separate litters of E. coli strain B and another strain K.\n\nThe key observation here is that four pluses were found on the K-litter, and 40 were found on the B-litter. Plaques indicate successful infection, meaning the phage successfully integrated into the bacterial chromosome and caused division or replication.\n\nI remember that when two mutations are present in a gene, their combination affects the phenotype. If the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), each mutation would have a certain effect. However, if there's partial recombination, one mutation's effect is masked by the presence of the other.\n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage isn't causing division, while the lytic phage does. So the presence of lysogenic phages must be linked to certain regions that allow them to replicate without dividing. This suggests that the lysogenic phage uses an integration site that's present in the lysogenic phage but not in the lytic phage.\n\nWait, no, actually, I think it's the opposite. The lysogenic phage integrates into the chromosome at a specific site, allowing it to replicate without division. The lytic phage doesn't integrate and instead replicates the entire chromosome, leading to cell division and possibly lysogeny.\n\nSo if you have both types of phages, the lysogenic phage will integrate, causing issues, while the lytic phage won't integrate but will replicate the entire chromosome, leading to cell divisions. So the presence of lysogenic phages is necessary for the issue observed, implying that the lysogenic phage has its own integration site.\n\nBut wait, how does this relate to recombination?

    "rollout": " But when they infect strain K, which doesn't do anything, maybe because it's resistant or something else.\n\nThe experiment involves a double mutation: both mutants are present on the same plasmid. So they must be recombining somewhere on the T_4 chromosome. The key point here is that if there was no recombination, all the plasmids would have the same mutation type, right? But since we see both types, some must have recombined.\n\nNow, the plate of E. coli strain B is infected with these two types. The result is that half the colonies die, then are diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto another lawn of strain B. On strain B, four plates show four pluses (meaning four colonies), while the other half are dilutioned into strain K. Then they're plated onto strain K, and four are found there, and 40 on the other side. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the recombination happened, then the two mutant phages would produce different recombinant forms. Each phage has its own mutation, say Type A and Type B. After recombination, they might form Type AB. Since the phages have two mutations, each from their respective strains, combining them could lead to either a recombinant or non-recombinant form.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of pluses observed? When they plate the half that died first onto strain B, they get four pluses. That suggests that the wild-type phage isn't being selected against, meaning those without any recombination aren't present. Wait, no\u2014if the wild-type is not being selected, but the mutants are, then perhaps the presence of four pluses indicates that the wild-type phage wasn't present in the first half because it's not viable under strain B's conditions.\n\nSo if only the recombinant form survived, then the wild-type would not appear. Therefore, the number of pluses corresponds to the number of recombinant forms. Since four pluses were found on strain B, that means four recombinant forms were present. Similarly, when the other half is plated onto strain K, four are found there, indicating that strain K's lawn didn't select for any of the original phages, implying that the wild-type wasn't present there either.\n\nThis implies that the wild-type phage isn't surviving, so the majority of the phages must be the recombinant ones. Now, the question is about the percentage of recombination. To find that, I'll use the formula:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of Recombinant Phages - Number of Wild-Type Phages) / Total Phages Plated \u00d7 100%\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, the proportion of recombinants compared to wild-type. Since the wild-type wasn't present in either half, all the surviving phages were recombinants. But wait, in the first half, they plated onto strain B, where the wild-type isn't present, so the surviving phages must be recombinants. In the second half, they plated onto strain K, where again the wild-type isn't present, so again the surviving phages are recombinants.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found in each case, that means four recombinant forms per 10^7 cells, and four per 10^5. Wait, no\u2014the dilutions are important. Dilution affects the concentration. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each colony represents 10^7 cells, but since the plating was done at a certain density, the number of phages would be calculated as:\n\nNumber of phages = (Number of plasmids * Mutations per phage) / Dilution factor.\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to calculate the probability of recombination. If p is the frequency of one mutation, q the other, and r the recombination rate, then the expected recombinant frequency would be 2prq(1-r).\n\nBut since the number of pluses matches the expected recombinant numbers, I can set up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N_total = total number of phages plated.\n- R = number of recombinant phages.\n- W = number of wild-type phages.\n\nFrom the first half (strain B):\nR / N_total = 4 / 10^7 \u2192 Equation 1.\n\nFrom the second half (strain K):\nR / N_total = 4 / 10^5 \u2192 Equation 2.\n\nHmm, but this seems conflicting because R can\u2019t be the same in both cases unless the wild-type is somehow affecting both. Alternatively, perhaps the dilution factors affect the count. Maybe the dilution is such that the number of phages present is proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution effect, the number of phages present in each dilution is proportional to 1/dilution factor. So, in the first half, 1/10^7 dilution, and in the second half, 1/10^5.\n\nThus, the expected number of recombinants would be R * (1/10^7 + 1/10^5). Because you take the proportion of each dilution and multiply by the total number of phages.\n\nSimilarly, for wild-type, it's W * (1/10^7 + 1/10^5).\n\nSince the wild-type wasn't selected, the number of wild-type phages should be zero, meaning that in both dilutions, only recombinant phages survived. Thus, the ratio of recombinant to wild-type in both dilutions should match the ratios given.\n\nBut according to the problem, four pluses appeared in each case, but perhaps the exact calculation needs to consider the dilution factors correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to model the probabilities. Let\u2019s assume that the probability of a phage carrying the first mutation is p, the second is q, and they recombine at rate r. Assuming independence, the probability of having a recombinant form is 2pq(1 - r).\n\nIf the number of recombinant forms is proportional to this probability multiplied by the dilution factor, then:\n\nFor the first dilution (1:10^7):\n\nRecombinant count = 2pq(1 - r) * (1/10^7)\n\nFor the second dilution (1:10^5):\n\nRecombinant count = 2pq(1 - r) * (1/10^5)\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, we had 4 pluses, and in the second, 40 pluses. Wait, but the counts are relative; the actual counts depend on the dilution factors. However, the problem states that four pluses are found on strain B and 40 on strain K. This suggests that in the first dilution, the number of plasmids present was lower, hence fewer plasmids leading to fewer pluses, whereas in the second dilution, the higher dilution factor allows more plasmids to survive, thus more pluses.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that the number of plasmids is the same in both dilutions. Then, the number of plasmids present in each dilution would determine the number of pluses. For example, in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is n, so the number of pluses is 2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e7. Similarly, in the second dilution, the number of plasmids is m, so 2pq(1 - r) * m / 1e5.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found in the first dilution and 40 in the second, assuming n and m are the same (since the same number of plasmids was plated twice, just at different densities), we can set up the equation:\n\n(2pq(1 - r) * n) / 1e7 = 4  \n(2pq(1 - r) * n) / 1e5 = 40  \n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\n[ (2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e5 ) ] / [ (2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e7 ) ] = 40 / 4  \nSimplifying, 1e7 / 1e5 = 10 = 10. Which checks out, so our assumption holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of plasmids is consistent across both dilutions. Now, solving for (2pq(1 - r)) * n:\n\nFrom the first equation: 2pq(1 - r) * n = 4 * 1e7  \n= 4e7\n\nIn the second equation: 2pq(1 - r) * n = 40 * 1e5  \n= 4e6\n\nWait, this discrepancy suggests I made a mistake. Actually, the correct division would be:\n\nSecond equation left side: 40 * 1e5 = 4e6  \nFirst equation left side: 4 * 1e7 = 4e7\n\nTaking the ratio: 4e6 / 4e7 = 0.1 = (n / 1e5) / (n / 1e7) )  \nBecause both sides have (2pq(1 - r) * n), dividing them cancels out variables. So:\n\n(n / 1e5) / (n / 1e7) = 0.1  \nWhich simplifies to (1e7 / 1e5) = 100 = 0.1, which is incorrect. Hmm, clearly my initial approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe instead, since the number of plasmids is the same in both dilutions, the ratio of pluses is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So pluses in the first dilution (n / 1e7) equals pluses in the second dilution (n / 1e5) multiplied by the dilution factor ratio.\n\nWait, pluses in first dilution: P1 = 4 = k * (1 / 1e7)  \nPluses in second dilution: P2 = 40 = k * (1 / 1e5)  \nWhere k is the constant of proportionality. Solving for k, 4 = k * 1e-7 \u21d2 k = 4e7  \nThen, 40 = 4e7 * 1e-5 \u21d2 4e7 * 1e-5 = 4e2 = 400, which contradicts. So something's wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the number of plasmids is proportional to the dilution factor. So if in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is x, then in the second, it's 10x (since 1e5 is 10 times larger than 1e7). So the number of plasmids in the first is x, in the second is 10x.\n\nThen, pluses in first: 2pq(1 - r) * x / 1e7 = 4  \nPluses in second: 2pq(1 - r) * (10x) / 1e5 = 40  \nSubstituting x from the first equation into the second:  \n2pq(1 - r) * (10x) / 1e5 = 40  \nBut from the first equation, 2pq(1 - r) * x = 4e7 \u21d2 2pq(1 - r) * x = 4e7  \nSo substituting into the second equation:  \n(10x) / 1e5 * (4e7) / 1e7 = 40  \nSimplify: (10x / 1e5) * 4 = 40  \n10x / 1e5 = 40 / 4 = 10  \n10x = 1e6 \u21d2 x = 1e5  \nThen, pluses in first: 2pq(1 - r) * 1e5 / 1e7 = 2pq(1 - r) * 0.1 = 4  \nSo 0.2pq(1 - r) = 4  \npq(1 - r) = 20  \nAssuming p = q = 0.5 (if they are independently distributed), then 0.25(1 - r) = 20 \u21d2 1 - r = 80 \u21d2 r = -79. Impossible. So my assumption that p=q=0.5 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps p and q are not equal. Let me try p=0.1 and q=0.1, then pq=0.01. Then 0.01*(1 - r)=20 \u21d2 1 - r=2000 \u21d2 r=-1999. Not possible. So maybe p=0.5, q=0.5, as before, but that leads to impossible value. Maybe p=0.25, q=0.25. Then pq=0.0625. 0.0625*(1 - r)=20 \u21d2 1 - r=320 \u21d2 r= -319. Still impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps the frequencies of the mutations are not independent. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the number of recombinants is determined by the product of the frequencies of each mutation, adjusted for recombination.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for genetic recombination frequency:\n\nF = (number of recombinant alleles) / (total alleles)\n\nBut in this case, it's more complex because it's on a plasmid, and we have multiple mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of recombinants per plasmid is 2pq(1 - r), and the total number of plasmids is N. Then, the total number of recombinant alleles would be 2pq(1 - r)*N.\n\nBut in the experiments, we\u2019re counting plasmids, not alleles, so maybe the number of plasmids directly correlates to the number of recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of recombinants. So if in the first dilution, 4 plasmids survived, and in the second, 40 plasmids survived, then the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the number of plasmids increased by a factor of 10 between the two dilutions, which makes sense because the second dilution was at a higher density (1:10^5 vs 1:10^7).\n\nNow, the number of recombinants in each dilution depends on the product of the mutation frequencies and the recombination rate. Assuming that the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants in each dilution is 2pq(1 - r) * D, where D is the dilution factor.\n\nSo for the first dilution (D=1e7):\n\nRecombinants = 2pq(1 - r) * 1e7  \nAnd the number of plasmids is proportional to this, say M = 2pq(1 - r) * 1e7  \nBut wait, M is the number of plasmids, which is also related to the number of recombinants. Since each plasmid has two copies, the number of recombinants would be 2 * M * r, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, thinking differently, the number of recombinants per plasmid is 2pq(1 - r). So if you have M plasmids, the total number of recombinants is 2Mpq(1 - r).\n\nBut in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is M = 4 / (2pq(1 - r) / 1e7)  \n= 4e7 / (2pq(1 - r))\n\nSimilarly, in the second dilution, M = 40e5 / (2pq(1 - r))\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n4e7 / (2pq(1 - r)) = 40e5 / (2pq(1 - r))  \nBut this simplifies to 4e7 = 40e5, which is not true. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nPerhaps another angle: since four plasmids survived in the first dilution and 40 in the second, the ratio of plasmids is 1:10. So the number of plasmids in the second is ten times that in the first. Therefore, the recombination rate must compensate for this increase in plasmids. So, if in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is N, and in the second, it's 10N, then the number of recombinants in the second is 10 times that in the first.\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinants is proportional to the number of plasmids and the recombination rate, we can write:\n\nR1 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \nR2 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nBut according to the problem, R1 = 4 and R2 = 40. So,\n\n4 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \n40 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \n40 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nFrom the first equation, 2pq(1 - r) = 4 / N  \nSubstitute into the second:\n\n40 = (4 / N) * 10N  \n40 = 40  \nThis confirms consistency, but doesn't help us solve for r.\n\nHowever, we know that the wild-type phage isn't surviving, so all plasmids must be recombinants. Therefore, the number of recombinants in the first dilution is 4, and in the second, 40, which aligns with the 10:1 ratio due to the 10x dilution.\n\nNow, to find r, the recombination rate, we can express it in terms of the number of plasmids. From the first dilution:\n\nR1 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \nWe don't know N yet, but perhaps we can express r in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of plasmids increases by a factor of 10, and the number of recombinants also increases by a factor of 10, the recombination rate must remain the same. Therefore, the change comes from the product of the mutation frequencies and the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the mutation frequencies are low, but let's proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that p = q = 0.5 (each mutation occurs in half the plasmids). Then:\n\nR1 = 2*0.5*0.5*(1 - r) * N = 0.5*(1 -",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't do anything, maybe because it's resistant or something else.\n\nThe experiment involves a double mutation: both mutants are present on the same plasmid. So they must be recombining somewhere on the T_4 chromosome. The key point here is that if there was no recombination, all the plasmids would have the same mutation type, right? But since we see both types, some must have recombined.\n\nNow, the plate of E. coli strain B is infected with these two types. The result is that half the colonies die, then are diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto another lawn of strain B. On strain B, four plates show four pluses (meaning four colonies), while the other half are dilutioned into strain K. Then they're plated onto strain K, and four are found there, and 40 on the other side. \n\nWait, let me think again. If the recombination happened, then the two mutant phages would produce different recombinant forms. Each phage has its own mutation, say Type A and Type B. After recombination, they might form Type AB. Since the phages have two mutations, each from their respective strains, combining them could lead to either a recombinant or non-recombinant form.\n\nBut how does this relate to the number of pluses observed? When they plate the half that died first onto strain B, they get four pluses. That suggests that the wild-type phage isn't being selected against, meaning those without any recombination aren't present. Wait, no\u2014if the wild-type is not being selected, but the mutants are, then perhaps the presence of four pluses indicates that the wild-type phage wasn't present in the first half because it's not viable under strain B's conditions.\n\nSo if only the recombinant form survived, then the wild-type would not appear. Therefore, the number of pluses corresponds to the number of recombinant forms. Since four pluses were found on strain B, that means four recombinant forms were present. Similarly, when the other half is plated onto strain K, four are found there, indicating that strain K's lawn didn't select for any of the original phages, implying that the wild-type wasn't present there either.\n\nThis implies that the wild-type phage isn't surviving, so the majority of the phages must be the recombinant ones. Now, the question is about the percentage of recombination. To find that, I'll use the formula:\n\n% Recombination = (Number of Recombinant Phages - Number of Wild-Type Phages) / Total Phages Plated \u00d7 100%\n\nWait, actually, more accurately, the proportion of recombinants compared to wild-type. Since the wild-type wasn't present in either half, all the surviving phages were recombinants. But wait, in the first half, they plated onto strain B, where the wild-type isn't present, so the surviving phages must be recombinants. In the second half, they plated onto strain K, where again the wild-type isn't present, so again the surviving phages are recombinants.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found in each case, that means four recombinant forms per 10^7 cells, and four per 10^5. Wait, no\u2014the dilutions are important. Dilution affects the concentration. The first half was diluted 1:10^7, meaning each colony represents 10^7 cells, but since the plating was done at a certain density, the number of phages would be calculated as:\n\nNumber of phages = (Number of plasmids * Mutations per phage) / Dilution factor.\n\nWait, maybe an easier way is to calculate the probability of recombination. If p is the frequency of one mutation, q the other, and r the recombination rate, then the expected recombinant frequency would be 2prq(1-r).\n\nBut since the number of pluses matches the expected recombinant numbers, I can set up equations.\n\nLet\u2019s denote:\n- N_total = total number of phages plated.\n- R = number of recombinant phages.\n- W = number of wild-type phages.\n\nFrom the first half (strain B):\nR / N_total = 4 / 10^7 \u2192 Equation 1.\n\nFrom the second half (strain K):\nR / N_total = 4 / 10^5 \u2192 Equation 2.\n\nHmm, but this seems conflicting because R can\u2019t be the same in both cases unless the wild-type is somehow affecting both. Alternatively, perhaps the dilution factors affect the count. Maybe the dilution is such that the number of phages present is proportional to the dilution factor.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilution effect, the number of phages present in each dilution is proportional to 1/dilution factor. So, in the first half, 1/10^7 dilution, and in the second half, 1/10^5.\n\nThus, the expected number of recombinants would be R * (1/10^7 + 1/10^5). Because you take the proportion of each dilution and multiply by the total number of phages.\n\nSimilarly, for wild-type, it's W * (1/10^7 + 1/10^5).\n\nSince the wild-type wasn't selected, the number of wild-type phages should be zero, meaning that in both dilutions, only recombinant phages survived. Thus, the ratio of recombinant to wild-type in both dilutions should match the ratios given.\n\nBut according to the problem, four pluses appeared in each case, but perhaps the exact calculation needs to consider the dilution factors correctly.\n\nAnother approach is to model the probabilities. Let\u2019s assume that the probability of a phage carrying the first mutation is p, the second is q, and they recombine at rate r. Assuming independence, the probability of having a recombinant form is 2pq(1 - r).\n\nIf the number of recombinant forms is proportional to this probability multiplied by the dilution factor, then:\n\nFor the first dilution (1:10^7):\n\nRecombinant count = 2pq(1 - r) * (1/10^7)\n\nFor the second dilution (1:10^5):\n\nRecombinant count = 2pq(1 - r) * (1/10^5)\n\nGiven that in the first dilution, we had 4 pluses, and in the second, 40 pluses. Wait, but the counts are relative; the actual counts depend on the dilution factors. However, the problem states that four pluses are found on strain B and 40 on strain K. This suggests that in the first dilution, the number of plasmids present was lower, hence fewer plasmids leading to fewer pluses, whereas in the second dilution, the higher dilution factor allows more plasmids to survive, thus more pluses.\n\nTo simplify, let's assume that the number of plasmids is the same in both dilutions. Then, the number of plasmids present in each dilution would determine the number of pluses. For example, in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is n, so the number of pluses is 2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e7. Similarly, in the second dilution, the number of plasmids is m, so 2pq(1 - r) * m / 1e5.\n\nGiven that four pluses were found in the first dilution and 40 in the second, assuming n and m are the same (since the same number of plasmids was plated twice, just at different densities), we can set up the equation:\n\n(2pq(1 - r) * n) / 1e7 = 4  \n(2pq(1 - r) * n) / 1e5 = 40  \n\nDividing the second equation by the first gives:\n\n[ (2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e5 ) ] / [ (2pq(1 - r) * n / 1e7 ) ] = 40 / 4  \nSimplifying, 1e7 / 1e5 = 10 = 10. Which checks out, so our assumption holds.\n\nTherefore, the number of plasmids is consistent across both dilutions. Now, solving for (2pq(1 - r)) * n:\n\nFrom the first equation: 2pq(1 - r) * n = 4 * 1e7  \n= 4e7\n\nIn the second equation: 2pq(1 - r) * n = 40 * 1e5  \n= 4e6\n\nWait, this discrepancy suggests I made a mistake. Actually, the correct division would be:\n\nSecond equation left side: 40 * 1e5 = 4e6  \nFirst equation left side: 4 * 1e7 = 4e7\n\nTaking the ratio: 4e6 / 4e7 = 0.1 = (n / 1e5) / (n / 1e7) )  \nBecause both sides have (2pq(1 - r) * n), dividing them cancels out variables. So:\n\n(n / 1e5) / (n / 1e7) = 0.1  \nWhich simplifies to (1e7 / 1e5) = 100 = 0.1, which is incorrect. Hmm, clearly my initial approach is flawed.\n\nMaybe instead, since the number of plasmids is the same in both dilutions, the ratio of pluses is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So pluses in the first dilution (n / 1e7) equals pluses in the second dilution (n / 1e5) multiplied by the dilution factor ratio.\n\nWait, pluses in first dilution: P1 = 4 = k * (1 / 1e7)  \nPluses in second dilution: P2 = 40 = k * (1 / 1e5)  \nWhere k is the constant of proportionality. Solving for k, 4 = k * 1e-7 \u21d2 k = 4e7  \nThen, 40 = 4e7 * 1e-5 \u21d2 4e7 * 1e-5 = 4e2 = 400, which contradicts. So something's wrong.\n\nPerhaps the correct relationship is that the number of plasmids is proportional to the dilution factor. So if in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is x, then in the second, it's 10x (since 1e5 is 10 times larger than 1e7). So the number of plasmids in the first is x, in the second is 10x.\n\nThen, pluses in first: 2pq(1 - r) * x / 1e7 = 4  \nPluses in second: 2pq(1 - r) * (10x) / 1e5 = 40  \nSubstituting x from the first equation into the second:  \n2pq(1 - r) * (10x) / 1e5 = 40  \nBut from the first equation, 2pq(1 - r) * x = 4e7 \u21d2 2pq(1 - r) * x = 4e7  \nSo substituting into the second equation:  \n(10x) / 1e5 * (4e7) / 1e7 = 40  \nSimplify: (10x / 1e5) * 4 = 40  \n10x / 1e5 = 40 / 4 = 10  \n10x = 1e6 \u21d2 x = 1e5  \nThen, pluses in first: 2pq(1 - r) * 1e5 / 1e7 = 2pq(1 - r) * 0.1 = 4  \nSo 0.2pq(1 - r) = 4  \npq(1 - r) = 20  \nAssuming p = q = 0.5 (if they are independently distributed), then 0.25(1 - r) = 20 \u21d2 1 - r = 80 \u21d2 r = -79. Impossible. So my assumption that p=q=0.5 is incorrect.\n\nWait, perhaps p and q are not equal. Let me try p=0.1 and q=0.1, then pq=0.01. Then 0.01*(1 - r)=20 \u21d2 1 - r=2000 \u21d2 r=-1999. Not possible. So maybe p=0.5, q=0.5, as before, but that leads to impossible value. Maybe p=0.25, q=0.25. Then pq=0.0625. 0.0625*(1 - r)=20 \u21d2 1 - r=320 \u21d2 r= -319. Still impossible.\n\nThis suggests that my approach is flawed. Perhaps the frequencies of the mutations are not independent. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the number of recombinants is determined by the product of the frequencies of each mutation, adjusted for recombination.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for genetic recombination frequency:\n\nF = (number of recombinant alleles) / (total alleles)\n\nBut in this case, it's more complex because it's on a plasmid, and we have multiple mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the number of recombinants per plasmid is 2pq(1 - r), and the total number of plasmids is N. Then, the total number of recombinant alleles would be 2pq(1 - r)*N.\n\nBut in the experiments, we\u2019re counting plasmids, not alleles, so maybe the number of plasmids directly correlates to the number of recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of plasmids is proportional to the number of recombinants. So if in the first dilution, 4 plasmids survived, and in the second, 40 plasmids survived, then the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the number of plasmids increased by a factor of 10 between the two dilutions, which makes sense because the second dilution was at a higher density (1:10^5 vs 1:10^7).\n\nNow, the number of recombinants in each dilution depends on the product of the mutation frequencies and the recombination rate. Assuming that the mutations are independent, the expected number of recombinants in each dilution is 2pq(1 - r) * D, where D is the dilution factor.\n\nSo for the first dilution (D=1e7):\n\nRecombinants = 2pq(1 - r) * 1e7  \nAnd the number of plasmids is proportional to this, say M = 2pq(1 - r) * 1e7  \nBut wait, M is the number of plasmids, which is also related to the number of recombinants. Since each plasmid has two copies, the number of recombinants would be 2 * M * r, but that complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, thinking differently, the number of recombinants per plasmid is 2pq(1 - r). So if you have M plasmids, the total number of recombinants is 2Mpq(1 - r).\n\nBut in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is M = 4 / (2pq(1 - r) / 1e7)  \n= 4e7 / (2pq(1 - r))\n\nSimilarly, in the second dilution, M = 40e5 / (2pq(1 - r))\n\nSetting these equal:\n\n4e7 / (2pq(1 - r)) = 40e5 / (2pq(1 - r))  \nBut this simplifies to 4e7 = 40e5, which is not true. Hence, this approach may not work.\n\nPerhaps another angle: since four plasmids survived in the first dilution and 40 in the second, the ratio of plasmids is 1:10. So the number of plasmids in the second is ten times that in the first. Therefore, the recombination rate must compensate for this increase in plasmids. So, if in the first dilution, the number of plasmids is N, and in the second, it's 10N, then the number of recombinants in the second is 10 times that in the first.\n\nAssuming that the number of recombinants is proportional to the number of plasmids and the recombination rate, we can write:\n\nR1 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \nR2 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nBut according to the problem, R1 = 4 and R2 = 40. So,\n\n4 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \n40 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nWhich simplifies to:\n\n4 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \n40 = 2pq(1 - r) * 10N  \nFrom the first equation, 2pq(1 - r) = 4 / N  \nSubstitute into the second:\n\n40 = (4 / N) * 10N  \n40 = 40  \nThis confirms consistency, but doesn't help us solve for r.\n\nHowever, we know that the wild-type phage isn't surviving, so all plasmids must be recombinants. Therefore, the number of recombinants in the first dilution is 4, and in the second, 40, which aligns with the 10:1 ratio due to the 10x dilution.\n\nNow, to find r, the recombination rate, we can express it in terms of the number of plasmids. From the first dilution:\n\nR1 = 2pq(1 - r) * N  \nWe don't know N yet, but perhaps we can express r in terms of known quantities.\n\nAlternatively, since the number of plasmids increases by a factor of 10, and the number of recombinants also increases by a factor of 10, the recombination rate must remain the same. Therefore, the change comes from the product of the mutation frequencies and the recombination rate.\n\nAssuming that the mutation frequencies are low, but let's proceed.\n\nLet\u2019s suppose that p = q = 0.5 (each mutation occurs in half the plasmids). Then:\n\nR1 = 2*0.5*0.5*(1 - r) * N = 0.5*(1 -",

After incubation, four plumes are found on K, and 40 on B.\n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution factors affect the probability of a mutation being expressed. A higher dilution factor means fewer cells exposed to the phage, so the chance of a mutation occurring decreases. Since the lysogenic phage works fine on strain B, it must be causing issues elsewhere.\n\nIn the first group (strain B), only the lysogenic phage caused problems. So any recombination would lead to more issues on strain B than on strain K because strain K lacks the lysogenic variant. \n\nLet me think about how recombination affects the outcome. If there's partial or complete recombination, some cells might express different mutations. In the case of E. coli, if a mutation from one phage and another from another phage interact, it could cause double mutant effects. However, since strain B has only the lysogenic phage, and strain K lacks it, any recombination would likely lead to issues on strain B but not on K.\n\nWait, the problem states that the lysogenic phage in strain B causes issues, but not strain K. So recombination must be such that it leads to expression of a mutation in strain B that's not present in K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that, when combined with the lysogenic phage's own mutation, creates an issue. \n\nBut actually, I'm getting confused here. Let me approach this differently. The key is to determine how many recombinants were formed between the two mutations. Each recombination event increases the likelihood of a double mutant phenotype.\n\nThe number of plasmid copies per cell is given by the dilution factor. For strain B, each cell has 1e-7 phages, meaning approximately one copy per cell. For strain K, it's 1e-5, so about ten copies per cell.\n\nIf there was no recombination, all cells would express either mutation A or mutation B independently. But with recombination, some cells would express a combination of both mutations. This would increase the likelihood of certain phenotypes, like having both mutations expressed together.\n\nLooking at the results: On strain B, four cells show a particular phenotype, while on strain K, four are found. Wait, no\u2014the phage is lysogenic on strain B, so maybe the lysogenic phage is expressing the mutation, but the lysogenic phage's own mutation isn't detected on strain K?\n\nActually, wait, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission but may cause some instability or other issues. Maybe it expresses a mutation that affects replication. If a recombination occurs, then when you mix phages with different mutations, you get a double mutant.\n\nSo for example, suppose mutation A is from the lysogenic phage and mutation B is from another phage. Recombination would mean that a cell gets both mutations. Without recombination, each cell would have either mutation A or mutation B, leading to different outcomes.\n\nIn the experiment, on strain B, four cells have a specific phenotype due to the lysogenic phage carrying mutation A. On strain K, which lacks the lysogenic phage, these cells don't express the mutation A, so the four plumes on K are those where the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues.\n\nSimilarly, on strain B, 40 plumes are found, which suggests that the lysogenic phage caused issues in 40% of the cells. Wait, but the total number of plumes depends on the number of cells and the probability of the mutation being expressed.\n\nEach cell has a certain number of phages. For strain B, 1e-7 phages per cell, and for strain K, 1e-5 phages per cell.\n\nIf there's a recombination between the two mutations, then some cells will express both mutations. The probability of a cell expressing both mutations would depend on the number of possible recombination events.\n\nAssuming each recombination event doubles the number of possible combinations, the expected number of cells expressing both mutations would be the product of their individual probabilities.\n\nFor strain B, each cell has 1e-7 phages, assuming only one mutation (mutation A) is present. For strain K, each cell has 1e-5 phages, again assuming only mutation A is present.\n\nWait, this is getting tangled. Let me simplify. The presence of recombination would increase the likelihood of both mutations being expressed in the same cell. The observed results suggest that on strain B, 40% of the cells have the lysogenic phage's mutation, which doesn't occur on strain K. Therefore, recombination must have occurred to allow the lysogenic phage to express a mutation that strain K doesn't have.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of Recombinant Cells) / (Total Number of Cells)\n\nBut in this case, the number of plumes gives us an idea. Each plume represents a cell where the lysogenic phage caused a problem. On strain B, 40 plumes (out of N) represent cells where the lysogenic phage caused issues. On strain K, 4 plumes (out of M) represent cells where the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues.\n\nSince the lysogenic phage doesn't cause issues on strain K, the 4 plumes correspond to cells where neither mutation was expressed. The remaining cells (N - 4) on strain B correspond to cells where the lysogenic phage did cause issues, i.e., where mutation A was expressed.\n\nNow, considering the numbers, let's assume that the total number of cells on each plate is similar, say N = M = X.\n\nOn strain B:\n- 40 plumes \u21d2 40 cells with lysogenic phage causing issues.\n- Remaining cells: X - 40 don't have lysogenic phage issues.\n\nOn strain K:\n- 4 plumes \u21d2 4 cells where lysogenic phage didn't cause issues.\n- Remaining cells: X - 4 don't have lysogenic phage issues.\n\nGiven that recombination allows the lysogenic phage to express a mutation that strain K lacks, the recombination frequency should reflect how often this happens.\n\nThe observed data suggests that when lysogenic phages are mixed with non-lysed phages (strain K), no issues occur. But when they're mixed with lysed phages (strain B), issues occur.\n\nThis indicates that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation that, when expressed in the presence of another phage, leads to double mutants. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage itself carries a mutation that, when mixed with non-lysed phages, causes issues.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination might refer to the interaction between the two phage types, allowing for a combination of their mutations to manifest.\n\nIn terms of calculating recombination frequency, if R is the number of recombinant cells, then:\n\nR = (Number of cells expressing both mutations) / Total number of cells\n\nBut in our case, the lysogenic phage causes issues on strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage itself is expressing a mutation that, when combined with another phage, leads to issues.\n\nAssuming that recombination leads to a 50% chance of combining the two mutations, the expected number of double mutants would be 0.5 * N.\n\nHowever, without knowing the exact number of recombinants, it's tricky. Instead, using the ratio of plumes can help estimate the recombination frequency.\n\nThe number of plumes on strain B is four times as high as on strain K (40 vs. 4). This suggests that the lysogenic phage is more likely to cause issues on strain B, indicating that recombination happened more frequently on strain B compared to strain K.\n\nBut since strain K lacks the lysogenic phage, the 4 plumes correspond to cells where the lysogenic phage didn't cause issues. Therefore, the difference in plume counts reflects the difference in the probability of recombination.\n\nWithout precise calculations, it's hard to determine the exact percentage, but looking at the options provided, the highest is 1%, followed by others. Given the significant difference in plume counts, the recombination frequency is likely low, closer to 0.1% (option D).\n\nAlternatively, considering the ratio of plumes, 40 vs. 4, which simplifies to 10:1, suggesting a high degree of variation. If recombination leads to a 50% effect, then 50% of the cells would express both mutations, but the observed data shows that 40% of strain B cells have issues, which is lower than 50%. Thus, recombination must be less frequent.\n\nTherefore, the recombination frequency is likely around 0.1%, making option D the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

One plate has the lysogenic phage causing half of the colonies to die. Then, this dilution is 1:10^7, which means each colony is spread into a medium where 1 part is original medium and 10^7 parts are from the dilution. This is then plated on a lawn of strain B. The other half plate is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. On the first plate, 40 plumes are found, and on the second plate, 4 plumes are found. \n\nWait, actually, when you have a plate, if half the colonies die, the remaining half should survive. So, if the lysogenic phage killed half, then the other half would have been cleared, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial condition. Let's think again. If the lysogenic phage is present, it should cause replication within the E. coli, leading to death of the host. So, in the first scenario, the lysogenic phage should kill half the bacteria, leaving half. These half would be then exposed to another culture. \n\nBut wait, no\u2014the problem says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Infection: Two types of mutantphages (mutant A, which is lysogenic and kills B; mutant C, which is lytic and doesn't kill B).\n2. Infected strain B: Only mutant C affects B cells, killing them.\n3. After lytic division, the lysogenic phage should replicate inside the E. coli, leading to cell death.\n4. So, the lysogenic phage will kill half of the B cells.\n5. Then, the remaining half (still in the media) are placed on a lawn of B. They should grow without lysis.\n6. Then, the same dilution (1:10^7) is taken for the next plate (which probably includes both mutants) and plated on strain K. The surviving cells should form plumes on strain K.\n\nIn the first case:\n- Half the B cells are killed (lytic), so the remaining half are in the media.\n- Plated on strain B's lawn: These should grow normally since they weren't lysed.\n- Placed on strain K's lawn: These should also grow normally since the lysogenic phage didn't affect B anyway.\n\nIn the second case:\n- Half the B cells are killed (lytic), so the remaining half are in the media.\n- Plated on strain K's lawn: These should grow normally as well.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the lysogenic phage (mutant C) can recombine with the T_4 phage or not. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during DNA replication. If the T_4 phage carries a mutation (like a restriction enzyme site) in the T4 gene, and the lysogenic phage (mutant C) carries a mutation in the T4 gene, their recombination could influence whether the lysogenic phage integrates into the T4 genome or remains outside.\n\nIf the T4 phage and the lysogenic phage recombine, the lysogenic phage's DNA would include the T4 gene along with its own, potentially allowing it to integrate into the T4 genome. However, if they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage would remain separate from the T4 phage.\n\nLooking at the results:\n- The first plate shows 40 plumes on strain B. Wait, how does that work?\n   - If the lysogenic phage caused cell death on B, those cells shouldn't have been plated on K's lawn because they died. So, the plumes would have been on strain B's lawn, not K's. Therefore, the number of plumes on K's lawn (which should have grown normally) wouldn't be affected by the lysogenic phage on B. But according to the problem statement, the first plate is on strain B, and the other on strain K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't affect the K cells, so all B cells survived.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The lysogenic phage (mutant C) kills B cells. So when the first plate is placed on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phage kills half the cells. Those that remain (half) should grow normally on strain B's lawn. When these are placed on strain K's lawn, they should also grow normally, forming plumes on K.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the first plate is placed on strain B's lawn, and the second on strain K's lawn. The results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage did not affect the K cells, so all cells were alive and grew on K. But why would that matter?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage was present in the B cells, causing them to die, and the surviving ones were placed on K's lawn, growing normally. But in reality, lysogenic phage usually doesn't kill the host unless it's a lytic phage. So, in this case, the lysogenic phage (mutant C) is a lytic phage, meaning it replicates inside the host cell, leading to cell death. Therefore, the host cells would die before any further growth occurs.\n\nSo, if the lysogenic phage (mutant C) is present in the B cells, it would lyse the cells, causing them to die. Thus, when the B cells are placed on K's lawn, they won't grow, resulting in no plumes on K's lawn. But in the problem, the K plate had some plumes, which implies that the lysogenic phage didn't kill the K cells, meaning that either the lysogenic phage didn't replicate inside the K cells or perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't integrate into the T4 phage genome.\n\nTherefore, the presence of lysogenic phage in the B cells leads to their death, but the K cells remain unaffected, allowing them to grow and form plumes on K's lawn. This indicates that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate into the T4 phage genome, meaning that the T4 phage and lysogenic phage do not recombine. Hence, there is no recombination event.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. So, if there's no recombination, the answer would suggest zero. However, none of the options directly say zero. Looking back at the options provided, the closest is option J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the proportion of plumes on each lawn to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes on a lawn depends on the efficiency of integration and the selection pressure. If the two phages recombine, the lysogenic phage might integrate better into the T4 phage, increasing its efficiency in lysing cells. Without recombination, it's less efficient, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would integrate better into the T4 phage, thus killing more cells than expected. If no recombination occurred, it would kill fewer cells, leading to more plumes.\n\nGiven the numbers:\n- On B: 40 plumes. Assuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all the B cells, leading to maximum plumes. With recombination, it would kill fewer, so more plumes.\n- On K: 4 plumes. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all K cells, leading to maximum plumes. With recombination, it would kill fewer, so fewer plumes.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage is in B cells, causing them to die. So, when placed on K's lawn, they shouldn't grow, hence no plumes. But in the problem, there are plumes on K, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't kill the K cells. Therefore, recombination must have occurred, meaning the lysogenic phage integrated into the T4 phage, allowing it to replicate within T4 and lyse cells, thereby killing more B cells than expected.\n\nThus, recombination increased the efficiency of lysing, leading to more plumes on B (as the lysogenic phage killed more B cells) and fewer plumes on K (since the lysogenic phage didn't kill K cells).\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for plume density. The number of plumes is proportional to the efficiency of lysogeny. The recombination rate (R) can be estimated using the formula R = (N1 + N2) / (N1 * N2), where N1 and N2 are the number of plumes observed on each lawn. However, I might be mixing up the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the efficiency of lysogeny: if recombination occurs with frequency r, then the probability that a phage integrates into the host is r. The number of plumes is proportional to r. Given that recombination increased the number of plumes on B (more deaths), while reducing them on K, indicating that recombination happened favorably on B.\n\nThe standard way to estimate recombination frequency is using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to the number of times events occur together. For example, if two mutations are linked, the number of double crossovers can indicate recombination rates.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to compare the plume densities. On B, 40 plumes, and on K, 4 plumes. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that recombination increased the number of plumes on B by a factor of 10 compared to expectations. Since recombination increases the efficiency of lysogeny, this ratio corresponds to an increase in the recombination rate.\n\nIf the expected number of plumes without recombination is N, then with recombination, it's N * (1 + r), where r is the recombination rate. Here, N1/N2 = 10/1, suggesting that r1/r2 = 9, where r1 is the recombination rate on B and r2 on K. But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination rate can be approximated by the ratio of plumes. If recombination happened on B, the efficiency of lysogeny was higher, leading to more plumes on B. Conversely, if no recombination happened, lysogeny was less efficient, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all B cells, so no plumes on B. But in reality, only half the B cells die, so some plumes should be on B. However, the problem states that on B, 40 plumes are found, and on K, 4. So, the difference in plume counts reflects the difference in recombination efficiency.\n\nThe number of plumes is proportional to the efficiency of lysogeny. The efficiency can be calculated as (number of plumes) / (total possible plumes). For B, total possible plumes would be high if no recombination, but with recombination, it's lower. Similarly for K.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, or 10:1. This ratio suggests that the efficiency of lysogeny was 10 times higher on B due to recombination. To find the recombination rate, we can assume that the recombination rate increases the efficiency by a certain factor.\n\nA common approximation is that if the efficiency increases by a factor of e, the recombination frequency can be approximated as ln(e). For example, if the efficiency doubles, ln(2)=0.693, so approximately 0.7% recombination. But this is a rough estimate.\n\nGiven the efficiency ratio of 10:1, the natural log of 10 is approximately 2.3026. Converting this to a percentage gives roughly 230%, which doesn't make sense because recombination frequencies are typically small percentages. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother approach is to model the efficiency of lysogeny as being dependent on the degree of recombination. If recombination occurs, the efficiency increases linearly. So, if the efficiency on B is k times that on K, the recombination rate can be approximated as (k - 1)/k. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the efficiency, assuming Poisson statistics. If the efficiency on B is 10x that on K, then the plume count would scale with sqrt(10), which is about 3.16x. But our observed ratio is 10x, so this doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plumes under different scenarios. Without recombination, all B cells die, so no plumes. With recombination, some cells remain, so plumes form. The number of plumes is determined by the efficiency of lysogeny, which depends on the degree of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote r as the recombination rate. Then, the efficiency of lysogeny on B is E_B = (1 - r), and on K, E_K = (1 - r). Wait, that can\u2019t be right because if recombination happens, the efficiency would change differently.\n\nActually, if recombination occurs, the efficiency of lysogeny would depend on the number of opportunities for integration. Each time the phage tries to integrate, there's a chance. If the rate of integration is r, then the efficiency would decrease by r. So, E_B = 1 - r, and similarly E_K = 1 - r. Wait, that can't be because both B and K cells would have the same recombination rate. But in reality, K is a different phage type, so perhaps the recombination rate differs.\n\nWait, no\u2014recombination rate is independent of the phage type. It's just the likelihood that the phage's genes are shared between the phage and the host. So, the same recombination rate applies regardless of the phage type.\n\nTherefore, if the recombination rate is r, then on B, the efficiency would be E_B = 1 - r, and on K, E_K = 1 - r. But this would mean that the efficiency is the same on both, which contradicts the observation that more plumes appear on B. So, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAh, I see. The efficiency of lysogeny is influenced by the availability of lysogens and the number of potential sites for integration. If the recombination rate is such that the lysogeny is more efficient on B, that suggests that the integration process is better optimized on B. Therefore, even though the recombination rate is the same, the efficiency changes depending on the host.\n\nBut this complicates things because now I'd need to know how the efficiency varies with the host. However, without specific data, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps I should look for a simplified method.\n\nAn alternative approach is to calculate the probability that the recombination occurred given the observed plume counts. Using the formula:\n\nP(recombination | data) = [P(data | recombination)] / [P(data | no recombination) + P(data | recombination)]\n\nUsing Bayesian reasoning, we can assign prior probabilities. Assuming no recombination is more likely initially, we can compute the posterior probability.\n\nUnder no recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all B cells, leading to zero plumes on B. Under recombination, some B cells remain, leading to plumes on B. The ratio of plumes observed (40 vs. 0) suggests that recombination significantly increased the number of plumes on B. \n\nIf we assume that without recombination, the expectation for B is zero, and with recombination, the expectation is some positive value, say x. The observed value is 40, which is much higher. To quantify the likelihood, we can use the Poisson distribution, where the expected number of events \u03bb is proportional to the efficiency.\n\nFor B: \u03bb_B = 40\nFor K: \u03bb_K = ?\n\nAssuming that without recombination, \u03bb_B = 0, and with recombination, \u03bb_B = x. The ratio \u03bb_B / \u03bb_K = 40 / 4 = 10. So, \u03bb_B = 10 * \u03bb_K.\n\nSince \u03bb is proportional to the efficiency, and the efficiency is related to the recombination rate, we can write:\n\n\u03bb_B = x = 10 * \u03bb_K\n\nBut \u03bb_K would correspond to the efficiency without recombination, which is zero. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps instead, the relative plume counts reflect the relative efficiencies. If the lysogenic phage is integrated better into the T4 phage on B, the efficiency on B is higher, leading to more plumes. Without recombination, the efficiency on B is zero, and on K, it's some value.\n\nBut in reality, both lysogenes (on B and K) share the same recombination origin, so their efficiencies should be similar. Therefore, the observed difference in plume counts might be due to other factors, like selection pressure or other mutations affecting lysogeny.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere concrete. Maybe I should refer back to standard methods for estimating recombination rates using plume experiments.\n\nOne standard approach is to use the formula:\n\nR \u2248 (ln(N1 + N2)) / (N1)\n\nWhere N1 and N2 are the number of plumes observed on two different plates. However, I'm not entirely confident about this formula.\n\nAlternatively, the coefficient of coincidence (CoC) is used to measure the relationship between two co-reciprocal selections, which can relate to recombination rates. CoC is defined as (number of observed coincidences) / (expected coincidences).\n\nBut without knowing the exact counts or the expected values, this might not help.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that the number of plumes on each plate is proportional to the number of times the lysogeny successfully integrated, which is influenced by the recombination rate. If recombination occurred, the efficiency increases, leading to more plumes.\n\nSuppose the number of plumes on B is 40, and on K is 4. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that recombination improved the efficiency by a factor of 10. Assuming that recombination improves efficiency multiplicatively, the recombination rate can be approximated by taking the logarithm of the improvement.\n\nln(10) \u2248 2.3026\n\nConverting this into a percentage gives roughly 230%, which doesn't make sense because recombination rates are typically small percentages. So, perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nMaybe the recombination rate is proportional to the improvement in efficiency. If recombination increased efficiency by a factor of 10, the recombination rate would be around 2.3%, but this is speculative.\n\nLooking at the options, the closest to a low recombination rate is option F (0.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But strain K isn't affected, meaning the lysogenic phage doesn't do anything there. \n\nThe experiment involves two plates. One plate has the lysogenic phage causing half of the colonies to die. Then, this dilution is 1:10^7, which means each colony is spread into a medium where 1 part is original medium and 10^7 parts are from the dilution. This is then plated on a lawn of strain B. The other half plate is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. On the first plate, 40 plumes are found, and on the second plate, 4 plumes are found. \n\nWait, actually, when you have a plate, if half the colonies die, the remaining half should survive. So, if the lysogenic phage killed half, then the other half would have been cleared, right? Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the initial condition. Let's think again. If the lysogenic phage is present, it should cause replication within the E. coli, leading to death of the host. So, in the first scenario, the lysogenic phage should kill half the bacteria, leaving half. These half would be then exposed to another culture. \n\nBut wait, no\u2014the problem says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me try to outline the steps:\n\n1. Infection: Two types of mutantphages (mutant A, which is lysogenic and kills B; mutant C, which is lytic and doesn't kill B).\n2. Infected strain B: Only mutant C affects B cells, killing them.\n3. After lytic division, the lysogenic phage should replicate inside the E. coli, leading to cell death.\n4. So, the lysogenic phage will kill half of the B cells.\n5. Then, the remaining half (still in the media) are placed on a lawn of B. They should grow without lysis.\n6. Then, the same dilution (1:10^7) is taken for the next plate (which probably includes both mutants) and plated on strain K. The surviving cells should form plumes on strain K.\n\nIn the first case:\n- Half the B cells are killed (lytic), so the remaining half are in the media.\n- Plated on strain B's lawn: These should grow normally since they weren't lysed.\n- Placed on strain K's lawn: These should also grow normally since the lysogenic phage didn't affect B anyway.\n\nIn the second case:\n- Half the B cells are killed (lytic), so the remaining half are in the media.\n- Plated on strain K's lawn: These should grow normally as well.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the lysogenic phage (mutant C) can recombine with the T_4 phage or not. Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during DNA replication. If the T_4 phage carries a mutation (like a restriction enzyme site) in the T4 gene, and the lysogenic phage (mutant C) carries a mutation in the T4 gene, their recombination could influence whether the lysogenic phage integrates into the T4 genome or remains outside.\n\nIf the T4 phage and the lysogenic phage recombine, the lysogenic phage's DNA would include the T4 gene along with its own, potentially allowing it to integrate into the T4 genome. However, if they don't recombine, the lysogenic phage would remain separate from the T4 phage.\n\nLooking at the results:\n- The first plate shows 40 plumes on strain B. Wait, how does that work?\n   - If the lysogenic phage caused cell death on B, those cells shouldn't have been plated on K's lawn because they died. So, the plumes would have been on strain B's lawn, not K's. Therefore, the number of plumes on K's lawn (which should have grown normally) wouldn't be affected by the lysogenic phage on B. But according to the problem statement, the first plate is on strain B, and the other on strain K. So perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't affect the K cells, so all B cells survived.\n\nWait, let me clarify. The lysogenic phage (mutant C) kills B cells. So when the first plate is placed on strain B's lawn, the lysogenic phage kills half the cells. Those that remain (half) should grow normally on strain B's lawn. When these are placed on strain K's lawn, they should also grow normally, forming plumes on K.\n\nHowever, the problem states that the first plate is placed on strain B's lawn, and the second on strain K's lawn. The results are 40 plumes on B and 4 on K. That suggests that the lysogenic phage did not affect the K cells, so all cells were alive and grew on K. But why would that matter?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage was present in the B cells, causing them to die, and the surviving ones were placed on K's lawn, growing normally. But in reality, lysogenic phage usually doesn't kill the host unless it's a lytic phage. So, in this case, the lysogenic phage (mutant C) is a lytic phage, meaning it replicates inside the host cell, leading to cell death. Therefore, the host cells would die before any further growth occurs.\n\nSo, if the lysogenic phage (mutant C) is present in the B cells, it would lyse the cells, causing them to die. Thus, when the B cells are placed on K's lawn, they won't grow, resulting in no plumes on K's lawn. But in the problem, the K plate had some plumes, which implies that the lysogenic phage didn't kill the K cells, meaning that either the lysogenic phage didn't replicate inside the K cells or perhaps the lysogenic phage didn't integrate into the T4 phage genome.\n\nTherefore, the presence of lysogenic phage in the B cells leads to their death, but the K cells remain unaffected, allowing them to grow and form plumes on K's lawn. This indicates that the lysogenic phage didn't integrate into the T4 phage genome, meaning that the T4 phage and lysogenic phage do not recombine. Hence, there is no recombination event.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about recombination between the two mutations in the T4 genome. So, if there's no recombination, the answer would suggest zero. However, none of the options directly say zero. Looking back at the options provided, the closest is option J (0.05%) and F (0.3%). Alternatively, perhaps the calculation needs to consider the proportion of plumes on each lawn to infer the likelihood of recombination.\n\nThe number of plumes on a lawn depends on the efficiency of integration and the selection pressure. If the two phages recombine, the lysogenic phage might integrate better into the T4 phage, increasing its efficiency in lysing cells. Without recombination, it's less efficient, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurred, the lysogenic phage would integrate better into the T4 phage, thus killing more cells than expected. If no recombination occurred, it would kill fewer cells, leading to more plumes.\n\nGiven the numbers:\n- On B: 40 plumes. Assuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all the B cells, leading to maximum plumes. With recombination, it would kill fewer, so more plumes.\n- On K: 4 plumes. Without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all K cells, leading to maximum plumes. With recombination, it would kill fewer, so fewer plumes.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage is in B cells, causing them to die. So, when placed on K's lawn, they shouldn't grow, hence no plumes. But in the problem, there are plumes on K, implying that the lysogenic phage didn't kill the K cells. Therefore, recombination must have occurred, meaning the lysogenic phage integrated into the T4 phage, allowing it to replicate within T4 and lyse cells, thereby killing more B cells than expected.\n\nThus, recombination increased the efficiency of lysing, leading to more plumes on B (as the lysogenic phage killed more B cells) and fewer plumes on K (since the lysogenic phage didn't kill K cells).\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula for plume density. The number of plumes is proportional to the efficiency of lysogeny. The recombination rate (R) can be estimated using the formula R = (N1 + N2) / (N1 * N2), where N1 and N2 are the number of plumes observed on each lawn. However, I might be mixing up the exact formula here.\n\nAlternatively, considering the efficiency of lysogeny: if recombination occurs with frequency r, then the probability that a phage integrates into the host is r. The number of plumes is proportional to r. Given that recombination increased the number of plumes on B (more deaths), while reducing them on K, indicating that recombination happened favorably on B.\n\nThe standard way to estimate recombination frequency is using the formula for the coefficient of coincidence, which relates to the number of times events occur together. For example, if two mutations are linked, the number of double crossovers can indicate recombination rates.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler approach is to compare the plume densities. On B, 40 plumes, and on K, 4 plumes. The ratio is 10:1, suggesting that recombination increased the number of plumes on B by a factor of 10 compared to expectations. Since recombination increases the efficiency of lysogeny, this ratio corresponds to an increase in the recombination rate.\n\nIf the expected number of plumes without recombination is N, then with recombination, it's N * (1 + r), where r is the recombination rate. Here, N1/N2 = 10/1, suggesting that r1/r2 = 9, where r1 is the recombination rate on B and r2 on K. But I'm not sure about this.\n\nAlternatively, the recombination rate can be approximated by the ratio of plumes. If recombination happened on B, the efficiency of lysogeny was higher, leading to more plumes on B. Conversely, if no recombination happened, lysogeny was less efficient, leading to fewer plumes.\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all B cells, so no plumes on B. But in reality, only half the B cells die, so some plumes should be on B. However, the problem states that on B, 40 plumes are found, and on K, 4. So, the difference in plume counts reflects the difference in recombination efficiency.\n\nThe number of plumes is proportional to the efficiency of lysogeny. The efficiency can be calculated as (number of plumes) / (total possible plumes). For B, total possible plumes would be high if no recombination, but with recombination, it's lower. Similarly for K.\n\nThe ratio of plumes on B to K is 40:4, or 10:1. This ratio suggests that the efficiency of lysogeny was 10 times higher on B due to recombination. To find the recombination rate, we can assume that the recombination rate increases the efficiency by a certain factor.\n\nA common approximation is that if the efficiency increases by a factor of e, the recombination frequency can be approximated as ln(e). For example, if the efficiency doubles, ln(2)=0.693, so approximately 0.7% recombination. But this is a rough estimate.\n\nGiven the efficiency ratio of 10:1, the natural log of 10 is approximately 2.3026. Converting this to a percentage gives roughly 230%, which doesn't make sense because recombination frequencies are typically small percentages. So perhaps this approach isn't correct.\n\nAnother approach is to model the efficiency of lysogeny as being dependent on the degree of recombination. If recombination occurs, the efficiency increases linearly. So, if the efficiency on B is k times that on K, the recombination rate can be approximated as (k - 1)/k. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes is proportional to the square root of the efficiency, assuming Poisson statistics. If the efficiency on B is 10x that on K, then the plume count would scale with sqrt(10), which is about 3.16x. But our observed ratio is 10x, so this doesn't align.\n\nPerhaps a better approach is to consider the expected number of plumes under different scenarios. Without recombination, all B cells die, so no plumes. With recombination, some cells remain, so plumes form. The number of plumes is determined by the efficiency of lysogeny, which depends on the degree of recombination.\n\nLet\u2019s denote r as the recombination rate. Then, the efficiency of lysogeny on B is E_B = (1 - r), and on K, E_K = (1 - r). Wait, that can\u2019t be right because if recombination happens, the efficiency would change differently.\n\nActually, if recombination occurs, the efficiency of lysogeny would depend on the number of opportunities for integration. Each time the phage tries to integrate, there's a chance. If the rate of integration is r, then the efficiency would decrease by r. So, E_B = 1 - r, and similarly E_K = 1 - r. Wait, that can't be because both B and K cells would have the same recombination rate. But in reality, K is a different phage type, so perhaps the recombination rate differs.\n\nWait, no\u2014recombination rate is independent of the phage type. It's just the likelihood that the phage's genes are shared between the phage and the host. So, the same recombination rate applies regardless of the phage type.\n\nTherefore, if the recombination rate is r, then on B, the efficiency would be E_B = 1 - r, and on K, E_K = 1 - r. But this would mean that the efficiency is the same on both, which contradicts the observation that more plumes appear on B. So, my assumption must be wrong.\n\nAh, I see. The efficiency of lysogeny is influenced by the availability of lysogens and the number of potential sites for integration. If the recombination rate is such that the lysogeny is more efficient on B, that suggests that the integration process is better optimized on B. Therefore, even though the recombination rate is the same, the efficiency changes depending on the host.\n\nBut this complicates things because now I'd need to know how the efficiency varies with the host. However, without specific data, it's hard to proceed. Perhaps I should look for a simplified method.\n\nAn alternative approach is to calculate the probability that the recombination occurred given the observed plume counts. Using the formula:\n\nP(recombination | data) = [P(data | recombination)] / [P(data | no recombination) + P(data | recombination)]\n\nUsing Bayesian reasoning, we can assign prior probabilities. Assuming no recombination is more likely initially, we can compute the posterior probability.\n\nUnder no recombination, the lysogenic phage would kill all B cells, leading to zero plumes on B. Under recombination, some B cells remain, leading to plumes on B. The ratio of plumes observed (40 vs. 0) suggests that recombination significantly increased the number of plumes on B. \n\nIf we assume that without recombination, the expectation for B is zero, and with recombination, the expectation is some positive value, say x. The observed value is 40, which is much higher. To quantify the likelihood, we can use the Poisson distribution, where the expected number of events \u03bb is proportional to the efficiency.\n\nFor B: \u03bb_B = 40\nFor K: \u03bb_K = ?\n\nAssuming that without recombination, \u03bb_B = 0, and with recombination, \u03bb_B = x. The ratio \u03bb_B / \u03bb_K = 40 / 4 = 10. So, \u03bb_B = 10 * \u03bb_K.\n\nSince \u03bb is proportional to the efficiency, and the efficiency is related to the recombination rate, we can write:\n\n\u03bb_B = x = 10 * \u03bb_K\n\nBut \u03bb_K would correspond to the efficiency without recombination, which is zero. So, this seems contradictory.\n\nPerhaps instead, the relative plume counts reflect the relative efficiencies. If the lysogenic phage is integrated better into the T4 phage on B, the efficiency on B is higher, leading to more plumes. Without recombination, the efficiency on B is zero, and on K, it's some value.\n\nBut in reality, both lysogenes (on B and K) share the same recombination origin, so their efficiencies should be similar. Therefore, the observed difference in plume counts might be due to other factors, like selection pressure or other mutations affecting lysogeny.\n\nThis line of thinking isn't leading me anywhere concrete.

So both mutations cause problems in different strains.\n\nThe experiment involves two halves of the E. coli population. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of strain B, resulting in four plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of strain K, giving four plumes. \n\nWait, let's break this down. Dilution factors affect how many bacteria are present at each replication. A higher dilution factor means fewer bacteria are plated, but more chance for a plume if there's an infection. The number of plumes indicates the number of resistant colonies formed.\n\nIn the first case, the sample is plated on strain B's lawn, which has the lysogenic mutation. So any phages that replicate in this area would lyse the cells unless there's a mutation preventing that. Since strain B has the lysogenic mutation, the lysogenic phages should be resistant. However, the problem states that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning perhaps it's the lytic mutation? Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage isn't affected, so maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated in such a way that it causes lytic fission, leading to death of the host cell.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell because it's doing lysogenic fission. So why does it affect strain B? Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait\u2014strain B has the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that causes lytic fission. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that leads to lysis, hence affecting the lysogenic phage's ability to lyse strain B. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage infects strain B, it doesn't lyse the cell because it's doing lysogenic fission. Therefore, strain B should survive. However, the problem says that the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So maybe the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that causes lysis, thus affecting strain B indirectly. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated in a way that causes lysis despite being lysogenic. This part is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is actually causing the cell to lyse, which contradicts its role as a lysogenic phage. I must be missing something here. Let's move forward with the numbers.\n\nEach half of the population is split into two groups: one is plated on strain B's lawn, the other on strain K's. Each group is then diluted 1:10^7 or 1:10^5 before being plated. The number of plumes observed is four for the first group and four for the second.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of resistant colonies is r = (plumes + 1)/dilution factor. For the first group:\n\nr1 = (4 + 1)/(1e7) = 5/1e7 = 5e-7\n\nFor the second group:\n\nr2 = (4 + 1)/(1e5) = 5/1e5 = 5e-5\n\nAssuming that each resistant colony requires multiple plumes, but since we're dealing with a high dilution, the probability of having multiple plumes in the same area might be low. However, the key point is the frequency of resistance, which relates to the genetic distance between the mutations.\n\nThe recombination frequency is the percentage of times two alleles from different genes assort independently during meiosis. In this context, the recombination refers to the genetic linkage between the two mutations in the T_4 phage.\n\nThe formula relating the number of plumes (resistant colonies) to recombination frequency is:\n\nRf = (r - (1 - r)) * 100%\n\nWhere Rf is the recombination frequency in percentage points.\n\nSo for the first group:\n\nr1 = 5e-7 \u2192 Rf1 = (5e-7 - (1 - 5e-7)) * 100% \u2248 (-9999995%) \u2192 Which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I've misunderstood the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of resistant colonies per million plasts is given by (r - (1 - r)) / 10^6.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the first group:\n\nr1 = 5e-7 per plasmid. So total resistant colonies = 5e-7 * 1e6 = 0.5 per million plasmas.\n\nSimilarly, for the second group:\n\nr2 = 5e-5 per plasmid. Total resistant = 5e-5 * 1e6 = 50 per million plasmas.\n\nNow, the formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRF = (r1 + r2) / (1 - r1 - r2)\n\nWait, I'm not sure about this formula. Another idea is that the expected number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the two mutations are linked, their combination will occur less frequently than expected under independent assortment.\n\nSo the expected number of plumes when two mutations are linked would be (f1 * f2) * 1e6.\n\nGiven that, we can solve for f1 * f2.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nFirst group: r1 = 5e-7 = f1 * f2 * 1e6 \u2192 f1 * f2 = 5e-13\n\nSecond group: r2 = 5e-5 = f1 * f2 * 1e6 \u2192 Same f1*f2 = 5e-11\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the assumption of independent assortment is invalid, implying some degree of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRF = [(r1 + r2)] / (1 - r1 - r2)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of recombinant plumes is r1 + r2, and the total possible is 1e6*(r1 + r2).\n\nWait, let's look up the exact method. The correct approach is to consider the number of recombinant colonies, which depends on the product of the allele frequencies.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the number of recombinants (non-parental combinations) is f1*f2*N, where N is the number of individuals.\n\nBut in this case, the problem gives us the number of plumes, which correspond to the number of recombinant colonies.\n\nSo, the total recombinant colonies = r1 + r2 = 5e-7 + 5e-5 = approx 5e-5.\n\nTotal possible recombinant colonies without linkage would be f1*f2*1e6.

Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can lyse the cell due to the presence of certain factors, making it effective against strain B even though it's lysogenic. Hmm, that seems unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can't lyse the cell, so it doesn't affect strain B, contradicting the problem statement. Maybe I'm misinterpreting the problem.\n\nWait, the problem says that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, but the lysogenic phage itself is supposed to do lysogenic fission, not lytic. So perhaps the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that causes lysis, leading to lower survival rates, thus affecting the lysogenic phage's ability to lyse strain B. I'm not entirely sure, but perhaps I'll proceed with the calculations assuming that the recombination frequency is related to the number of plumes.\n\nGiven the options, E is 0.02%, which aligns closely with my initial calculation of approximately 0.005%. However, 0.02% is double that, so maybe I missed a factor somewhere.\n\nWait, perhaps the dilution factors were applied incorrectly. The samples were plated on different dilutions: 1:1e7 and 1:1e5. But the number of plumes increases as the dilution factor decreases, meaning higher plating efficiency. So a higher dilution allows more plating with fewer plumes, but in our case, the number of plumes increased as the dilution decreased, which makes sense.\n\nAnother thought: The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the dilution factor. So, higher dilution (lower N) reduces the chance of a plume, but also may increase the likelihood of multiple plumes in the same area. However, in this scenario, each group was plated separately, so the number of plumes reflects the actual occurrence in each area.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to compute the probability of recombination based on the observed plume frequencies. Given that, I think the closest answer is E: 0.02%.\n\nAlternatively, considering the recombination frequency RF is calculated as:\n\nRF = (number of recombinant colonies) / (total possible recombinant colonies)\n\nIf the number of recombinant colonies is r1 + r2 =5e-7 +5e-5=5.05e-5, and the total possible recombinant colonies without interference would be f1*f2*1e6.\n\nWait, but without knowing f1 and f2, I can't directly compute RF. However, from the previous calculation, RF\u22485.05e-5%, which is approximately 0.005%. None of the options match this exactly, but option E is 0.02%, which is roughly twice that.\n\nMaybe I'm missing a factor of ten somewhere. Let's recalculate:\n\nNumber of plumes for first group: r1=(4+1)/(1e7)=5/(1e7)=5e-7\n\nNumber of plumes for second group: r2=(4+1)/(1e5)=5/(1e5)=5e-5\n\nTotal recombinant colonies: r1 + r2 =5e-7 +5e-5=5.05e-5\n\nTotal possible recombinant colonies without recombination: f1*f2*1e6\n\nBut f1*f2 is equal to the expected recombinant colonies under independent assortment, which would be (r1 + r2)*N / (1e6), but I'm getting stuck here.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula RF = (r1 + r2) / (1 - r1 - r2) gives 5.05e-5, which is ~0.005%, closer to option E (0.02%).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when the lysogenic phage infects strain K, which doesn't have the mutation causing the lytic issue, neither does anything happen. So both mutations cause problems in different strains.\n\nThe experiment involves two halves of the E. coli population. One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a lawn of strain B, resulting in four plumes. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of strain K, giving four plumes. \n\nWait, let's break this down. Dilution factors affect how many bacteria are present at each replication. A higher dilution factor means fewer bacteria are plated, but more chance for a plume if there's an infection. The number of plumes indicates the number of resistant colonies formed.\n\nIn the first case, the sample is plated on strain B's lawn, which has the lysogenic mutation. So any phages that replicate in this area would lyse the cells unless there's a mutation preventing that. Since strain B has the lysogenic mutation, the lysogenic phages should be resistant. However, the problem states that the lysogenic phage affects strain B, meaning perhaps it's the lytic mutation? Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage isn't affected, so maybe the lysogenic phage is being replicated in such a way that it causes lytic fission, leading to death of the host cell.\n\nBut wait, the lysogenic phage shouldn't lyse the cell because it's doing lysogenic fission. So why does it affect strain B? Maybe I'm misunderstanding. Oh, wait\u2014strain B has the lysogenic mutation, so the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that causes lytic fission. That doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that leads to lysis, hence affecting the lysogenic phage's ability to lyse strain B. Hmm, perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me think differently.\n\nWhen the lysogenic phage infects strain B, it doesn't lyse the cell because it's doing lysogenic fission. Therefore, strain B should survive. However, the problem says that the lysogenic phage affects strain B. So maybe the lysogenic phage can't replicate in a way that causes lysis, thus affecting strain B indirectly. Or perhaps the lysogenic phage is being replicated in a way that causes lysis despite being lysogenic. This part is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the lysogenic phage is actually causing the cell to lyse, which contradicts its role as a lysogenic phage. I must be missing something here. Let's move forward with the numbers.\n\nEach half of the population is split into two groups: one is plated on strain B's lawn, the other on strain K's. Each group is then diluted 1:10^7 or 1:10^5 before being plated. The number of plumes observed is four for the first group and four for the second.\n\nThe formula to calculate the number of resistant colonies is r = (plumes + 1)/dilution factor. For the first group:\n\nr1 = (4 + 1)/(1e7) = 5/1e7 = 5e-7\n\nFor the second group:\n\nr2 = (4 + 1)/(1e5) = 5/1e5 = 5e-5\n\nAssuming that each resistant colony requires multiple plumes, but since we're dealing with a high dilution, the probability of having multiple plumes in the same area might be low. However, the key point is the frequency of resistance, which relates to the genetic distance between the mutations.\n\nThe recombination frequency is the percentage of times two alleles from different genes assort independently during meiosis. In this context, the recombination refers to the genetic linkage between the two mutations in the T_4 phage.\n\nThe formula relating the number of plumes (resistant colonies) to recombination frequency is:\n\nRf = (r - (1 - r)) * 100%\n\nWhere Rf is the recombination frequency in percentage points.\n\nSo for the first group:\n\nr1 = 5e-7 \u2192 Rf1 = (5e-7 - (1 - 5e-7)) * 100% \u2248 (-9999995%) \u2192 Which doesn't make sense. Perhaps I've misunderstood the calculation.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of resistant colonies per million plasts is given by (r - (1 - r)) / 10^6.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nFor the first group:\n\nr1 = 5e-7 per plasmid. So total resistant colonies = 5e-7 * 1e6 = 0.5 per million plasmas.\n\nSimilarly, for the second group:\n\nr2 = 5e-5 per plasmid. Total resistant = 5e-5 * 1e6 = 50 per million plasmas.\n\nNow, the formula for recombination frequency is:\n\nRF = (r1 + r2) / (1 - r1 - r2)\n\nWait, I'm not sure about this formula. Another idea is that the expected number of plumes is proportional to the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. If the two mutations are linked, their combination will occur less frequently than expected under independent assortment.\n\nSo the expected number of plumes when two mutations are linked would be (f1 * f2) * 1e6.\n\nGiven that, we can solve for f1 * f2.\n\nFrom the data:\n\nFirst group: r1 = 5e-7 = f1 * f2 * 1e6 \u2192 f1 * f2 = 5e-13\n\nSecond group: r2 = 5e-5 = f1 * f2 * 1e6 \u2192 Same f1*f2 = 5e-11\n\nThis inconsistency suggests that the assumption of independent assortment is invalid, implying some degree of recombination.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me use the formula for recombinant frequency:\n\nRF = [(r1 + r2)] / (1 - r1 - r2)\n\nBut I'm not sure. Alternatively, the number of recombinant plumes is r1 + r2, and the total possible is 1e6*(r1 + r2).\n\nWait, let's look up the exact method. The correct approach is to consider the number of recombinant colonies, which depends on the product of the allele frequencies.\n\nIf the two mutations are linked, the number of recombinants (non-parental combinations) is f1*f2*N, where N is the number of individuals.\n\nBut in this case, the problem gives us the number of plumes, which correspond to the number of recombinant colonies.\n\nSo, the total recombinant colonies = r1 + r2 = 5e-7 + 5e-5 = approx 5e-5.\n\nTotal possible recombinant colonies without linkage would be f1*f2*1e6. But without knowing f1 and f2, it's tricky.\n\nWait, but perhaps using the formula RF = (r1 + r2) / (1 - r1 - r2). Let's plug in the values.\n\nr1 = 5e-7, r2 =5e-5\n\nSo numerator: 5e-7 +5e-5=5.05e-5\n\nDenominator:1 -5e-7 -5e-5\u22481\n\nThus RF\u2248(5.05e-5)/1\u22485.05e-5%, which is 0.00505%.

The result was half the colonies died.\n- Then, half of those dead colonies were diluted 1:10^7 and plated on a strain B lawn. This resulted in 4 pluses on strain B.\n- The other half (still half of the original) was diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a strain K lawn. Here, there were 40 pluses on strain K.\n\nThe question is about the recombination between the two mutations. Recombination refers to whether the two mutations occur independently or together at the same site on the phage's genome.\n\nIn experiments like these, you typically expect some number of recombinants. If there's no recombination, all offspring should be parental types without any new mutations. If there's complete recombination, you'd get some recombinant offspring if the mutations are present in each parent.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, there were 4 pluses from the K plate, which suggests that the lysogenic phage (since it didn't die) combined with the lytic phage (which did die) resulted in more recombinant colonies. Wait, no\u2014the K plate had the lysogenic phage being combined with another phage. So perhaps the presence of recombination affects the distribution of plasmids.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting confused. Let me think again. If the mutations are independent (no recombination), then the probability of each combination would be proportional to their frequencies in the parents. In this case, since both mutant types are present, we might expect certain combinations.\n\nBut let's consider the actual counts. On the K plate, 40 pluses were found. That seems high compared to the 4 on the B plate. Maybe the frequency of each mutation matters here.\n\nAlternatively, the presence of recombination could affect how often the mutations combine. For example, if recombination occurs, each phage may bring its own mutation, leading to different outcomes than if they're independent.\n\nWait, maybe I should calculate expected values under independence versus recombination. If there's no recombination, what would happen? Suppose in the cross, each phage has a certain proportion of wild-type vs mutated. If both have wild-type, nothing happens; if one has a mutation and the other doesn't, it leads to the lysogenic phage taking over, etc.\n\nLet me try to model this. Let\u2019s assume that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation (say, resistance gene) and the lytic phage doesn\u2019t. When they mate, if recombination occurs, the offspring will have a mixture\u2014so they won't cause lysis. If no recombination, each offspring will take either the lysogenic or the lytic phage.\n\nBut wait, in reality, the offspring's fate depends on whether the plasmid is wild-type or mutant. Since the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, any colonies that inherit it will die. Those that inherit the wild-type will survive.\n\nIn the first test, both mutant types were present, and only half the colonies died. This suggests that the presence of both mutants didn't lead to full lethality. So maybe there's some recombination occurring, meaning the mutations aren't independent.\n\nOn the second test, the half that died (which was the one with both mutants) was further tested. They dilute it 1:10^7 and plate on strain B. The K plate was the one that survived better, showing more pluses.\n\nHmm, maybe I should look for the ratio of recombinants. The number of pluses on the K plate is much higher than on the B plate, suggesting that recombination occurred more frequently on the K side.\n\nIf recombination happened, then the number of recombinant plomas would depend on the frequency of the mutations. Each mutation has a certain chance of occurring in each phage.\n\nSuppose the lysogenic phage (let's call it L) carries a mutation (e.g., R), and the lytic phage (P) doesn't. When they mate, the offspring can either be LL (both wild-type), LP (wild-type from P and mutant from L), PL (same as LP due to no recombination?), or LL again. Wait, no\u2014if there's recombination, then the offspring could have a combination.\n\nWait, actually, without recombination, the offspring would always be either LL or LP. With recombination, some would have RL, PR, RR, etc., depending on where the mutation came from.\n\nBut perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think in terms of expected plasmid loss. The original experiment showed that both mutants caused death in the B plate. When the B mutants were further tested, they died less often.\n\nWait, no, on the B plate, only half the colonies died. On the K plate, 40 pluses were found, which is a lot higher than on the B plate. So maybe recombination increased the likelihood of receiving the mutant plasmid.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the expected number of plasmids lost (or alive) would depend on the initial proportions. But perhaps the key is to compare the observed recombination fractions.\n\nAnother approach: the difference in plasmid loss rates between the two plates. The B plate had lower plasmid loss than the K plate. This suggests that the recombination fraction is higher in the K plate.\n\nWait, but the exact calculation isn't clear to me yet. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids lost (recombinations) on the K plate was higher relative to the B plate, indicating more recombination.\n\nGiven the options, the possible answer is likely a small percentage, such as 0.05% (option J) or 0.02% (option I).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The K plate had 40 pluses, while the B plate had 4. That's an 8:1 ratio. Perhaps this reflects the effect of recombination. If the recombination rate is R, the probability of inheriting the mutant plasmid would be R.\n\nSo if the ratio of plasmids lost on the K plate to the B plate is 40:4 = 10:1, then R would be approximately 9/10, but that doesn't make sense because recombination probabilities are usually low.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for recombinant fraction. If F is the number of recombinant plasmids, then F = (R * (1 - R)), where R is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut given the data, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.05%.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the dilution factor is 10^5, meaning the concentration is 10^-5 M. The K plate has a similar dilution but 10^5 instead of 10^7, so 10^-5 vs 10^-7.\n\nThis might indicate that the K plate had a higher concentration of the mutant phage, making it easier to detect more plasmids. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference in plasmid loss indicates the effect of recombination. The fact that more plasmids were lost on the K plate suggests that recombination occurred more frequently there.\n\nSince the options include percentages, and assuming that the recombination frequency is small, the closest option is probably D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). Given the higher ratio of plasmids lost on the K plate, maybe the recombination frequency is closer to 0.2%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to approach this is to calculate the expected number of recombinant plasmids based on recombination frequency and compare it to the observed number.\n\nAssuming the recombination frequency (R) is 0.05%, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be R * total plasmids. But without knowing the total plasmids, it's hard to compute. However, the significant difference in plasmid loss suggests a moderate recombination frequency, possibly around 0.05%.\n\nThus, the answer might be I (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Considering that 0.05% is exactly option J, and the numbers suggest a slight difference, I think the correct answer is J, 0.05%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

On the K plate, 40 pluses were found, which is a lot higher than on the B plate. So maybe recombination increased the likelihood of receiving the mutant plasmid.\n\nIf there was no recombination, the expected number of plasmids lost (or alive) would depend on the initial proportions. But perhaps the key is to compare the observed recombination fractions.\n\nAnother approach: the difference in plasmid loss rates between the two plates. The B plate had lower plasmid loss than the K plate. This suggests that the recombination fraction is higher in the K plate.\n\nWait, but the exact calculation isn't clear to me yet. Alternatively, considering that the number of plasmids lost (recombinations) on the K plate was higher relative to the B plate, indicating more recombination.\n\nGiven the options, the possible answer is likely a small percentage, such as 0.05% (option J) or 0.02% (option I).\n\nWait, but let me think again. The K plate had 40 pluses, while the B plate had 4. That's an 8:1 ratio. Perhaps this reflects the effect of recombination. If the recombination rate is R, the probability of inheriting the mutant plasmid would be R.\n\nSo if the ratio of plasmids lost on the K plate to the B plate is 40:4 = 10:1, then R would be approximately 9/10, but that doesn't make sense because recombination probabilities are usually low.\n\nWait, perhaps I should use the formula for recombinant fraction. If F is the number of recombinant plasmids, then F = (R * (1 - R)), where R is the recombination frequency.\n\nBut given the data, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.05%.\n\nWait, looking back at the problem statement: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the dilution factor is 10^5, meaning the concentration is 10^-5 M. The K plate has a similar dilution but 10^5 instead of 10^7, so 10^-5 vs 10^-7.\n\nThis might indicate that the K plate had a higher concentration of the mutant phage, making it easier to detect more plasmids. But I'm not sure how this directly relates to recombination.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the difference in plasmid loss indicates the effect of recombination. The fact that more plasmids were lost on the K plate suggests that recombination occurred more frequently there.\n\nSince the options include percentages, and assuming that the recombination frequency is small, the closest option is probably D (0.1%) or E (0.2%). Given the higher ratio of plasmids lost on the K plate, maybe the recombination frequency is closer to 0.2%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another way to approach this is to calculate the expected number of recombinant plasmids based on recombination frequency and compare it to the observed number.\n\nAssuming the recombination frequency (R) is 0.05%, the expected number of recombinant plasmids would be R * total plasmids. But without knowing the total plasmids, it's hard to compute. However, the significant difference in plasmid loss suggests a moderate recombination frequency, possibly around 0.05%.\n\nThus, the answer might be I (0.02%) or J (0.05%). Considering that 0.05% is exactly option J, and the numbers suggest a slight difference, I think the correct answer is J, 0.05%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

After incubation, the population was split into two halves: one half was diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto strain B's lawn, while the other half was similarly dilutioned but plated onto strain K's lawn. The results showed four pluses on strain K and 40 on strain B. \n\nFrom what I remember, the number of recombinants (plated colonies) relates to the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring. So if there's a certain probability that each mutation occurs independently, their combined effect would be the product of these probabilities. Since the phages cause different outcomes (lysis vs. no lysozlam), any recombination would lead to lethality. \n\nIn this case, the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B, but affects strain K. The fact that only the lysogenic phage worked on strain B suggests that its mutation isn't lethal unless paired with another mutation. However, since it didn't work on K, the lysogenic phage must have a low chance of causing recombination or maybe just doesn't occur enough times to cause lethality. \n\nThe ratio of successful plating on K to B is 40/4=10. That's an 10-fold increase in success on K compared to B. This suggests that the probability of the lysogenic phage working on K is ten times higher than on B, which implies that each mutation has a 10% chance of being present. Wait, but actually, since it's a product, let's think differently. If p is the probability of lysogenic phage working on B and q for K, then the probability that both work without recombination is p*q. But here, only the lysogenic phage affected K, meaning q = p + r, where r is the recombination probability. Hmm, maybe I'm complicating it. \n\nAlternatively, considering that the recombination frequency (RF) is calculated using the formula RF = 1 - (p + q - pq), where p and q are the frequencies of each mutation. In this case, the presence of the lysogenic phage leads to lethality on B but not on K. So the only lethality comes from the combination of the two mutations. Therefore, the RF would be the fraction of cases where both mutations occur. \n\nIf the ratio of K to B plating is 10:1, that could mean that the probability of the lysogenic phage causing a mutation on K is 10 times that on B. Let\u2019s assume that the probability of lysogenic phage causing a mutation on B is x, and on K is 10x. Then, the probability that neither mutation occurs is (1-x)(1-10x). But since the only lethality is when both mutations happen, the ratio of lethal to non-lethal should reflect the RF. \n\nWait, perhaps a better approach is to consider that the ratio of successful plating (lysogenic phage not killing) on K to B is 10:1. If p is the probability that lysogenic phage causes a mutation on B, and q is the probability it causes a mutation on K, then the probability that it doesn\u2019t kill either is (1-p)(1-q). But since the ratio is 10:1, we might infer that q/p = 10, assuming that the mutations are independent. \n\nSo if q = 10p, then the RF (recombination frequency) is given by the formula RF = 1 - (p + q - pq) = 1 - (p + 10p - 10p\u00b2) = 1 - (11p - 10p\u00b2). To find p, we can set up the equation based on the observed ratio. The ratio of K to B plating is 10:1, which corresponds to the ratio of the number of successful plating on K to B, which is proportional to (1-p)(1-q)/(1-p)(1-p) )= (1-q)/(1-p) \u2248 10. So (1-10p)/(1-p)=10 \u2192 1-10p=10(1-p) \u2192 1-10p=10-10p \u2192 -9p=9 \u2192 p=-1, which doesn't make sense. Maybe I made a mistake in setting up the ratio. \n\nAnother way: The number of colonies on K is 40, and on B is 4, so the ratio is 10:1. This means that the probability of the lysogenic phage not killing on K is 10 times that on B. If p is the probability of lysogenic phage working on B, then the probability it doesn't kill on B is 1-p, and on K it's 10*(1-p). Assuming independence, the probability that both work is (1-p)(10(1-p))=10(1-p)^2. This should equal the ratio of lethal to non-lethal, which is 10:1. So 10(1-p)^2 = 10/1 \u2192 (1-p)^2 = 0.1 \u2192 1-p = sqrt(0.1) \u2248 0.316 \u2192 p\u22480.684. \n\nBut wait, p is the probability of lysogenic phage causing a mutation on B, which shouldn't exceed 1.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct approach is that the number of plating on K is 10 times more likely due to some additive effect, leading to a recombination frequency calculation. \n\nGiven the options provided, the closest answer is F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Considering my approximate calculation led to around 0.684%, which rounds to 0.7%, but none of the options match exactly. However, looking at the options, 0.5% is an option (G), and 0.3% (F). My earlier approximation suggested about 0.7%, but perhaps the exact calculation yields a lower value, say 0.3%. Alternatively, maybe I overestimated p. \n\nLet me try again. If the number of colonies on K is 40 and on B is 4, the ratio is 10:1. This suggests that the probability of the lysogenic phage not killing on K is 10 times that on B. If p is the probability of mutation on B, then the probability of mutation on K is 10p. The probability that both mutate is p*10p=10p\u00b2. The ratio of lethal to non-lethal is 10:1, so 10p\u00b2=10/1 \u2192 p\u00b2=1/10 \u2192 p=0.316. So approximately 31.6%, which doesn't fit the options. \n\nWait, perhaps I misunderstood the ratio. The actual number of colonies on K is 40, on B is 4, so the ratio is 10:1. This ratio represents the number of successfully plated phages on K versus B. If the probability of lysogenic phage causing a mutation on K is q, then the number of plating on K is proportional to q*(1-q), and on B it's proportional to q*(1-q) as well? No, that wouldn't change the ratio. \n\nAlternatively, if the number of plating on K is 10 times that on B, then the probability of lysogenic phage working on K is 10 times that on B. Let p be the probability on B, then on K it's 10p. The total number of plating is proportional to p(1-p) + 10p(1-10p). But the ratio of K to B plating is 10:1, so [10p(1-10p)]/[p(1-p)] =10. Solving this:\n\n[10p(1-10p)]/[p(1-p)] =10  \nSimplify numerator:10p -100p\u00b2  \nDenominator:p -p\u00b2  \nSo (10p -100p\u00b2)/(p -p\u00b2)=10  \nMultiply both sides by denominator:10p -100p\u00b2=10(p -p\u00b2)  \nExpand right side:10p -10p\u00b2  \nSet equal:10p -100p\u00b2=10p -10p\u00b2  \nSubtract 10p from both sides:-100p\u00b2=-10p\u00b2  \nAdd 100p\u00b2 to both sides:0=90p\u00b2  \nWhich implies p=0. That can't be right. So perhaps I made a wrong assumption somewhere. \n\nMaybe the recombination frequency is calculated differently. The formula for RF is RF = 1 - (p + q - pq), where p is the frequency of one mutation and q is the frequency of the other. Given that the ratio of K to B plating is 10:1, and assuming that the only lethality is when both mutations occur, then the ratio of lethal to non-lethal is 10:1. \n\nSo, the probability of both mutations is 10/(1+10)=1/11\u22480.0909. Using the RF formula: RF =1 - (p + q - pq)=1 - (p + q - 10/(1+p+q)). But this seems complicated. Alternatively, knowing that RF = 1 - (p + q - pq), and if the RF is small, then p and q are small. Suppose p=q=r, then RF=1 - (2r - r\u00b2). If RF is small, like 0.05, then 0.05\u22481 - (2r - r\u00b2). Rearranged:2r -r\u00b2\u22480.95. Solving quadratic equation: r\u00b2 -2r +0.95=0. Discriminant:4 -3.8=0.2; roots=(2\u00b1sqrt(0.2))/2\u2248(2\u00b10.447)/2\u21921.223 or 0.777. But this gives positive values, so maybe RF is about 0.25%. Looking back at the options, D is 0.1% and F is 0.3%. So perhaps the correct RF is around 0.2%, which is option D. \n\nAlternatively, considering the initial setup, if the lysogenic phage on B doesn't cause any problems, but on K it does, implying that the mutation causes recombination. The ratio of K to B plating is 10:1, suggesting that the mutation occurs 10 times less frequently on B, which might indicate a higher frequency elsewhere.

Or vice versa?\n\nThe experiment involves a double infection of strain B. They plate it twice: once dilute 1:10^7 and another dilute 1:10^5. The first gives a half that's saturated, then diluted again, and the second half is more concentrated. Then these plasmids are plated on strain B and K respectively. \n\nFrom the results:\n- On strain B, there are 40 pluses (lytic fission).\n- On strain K, there are 4 pluses.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. The problem says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was dilated 1:10^7 and led to 40 pluses on B, and the second half was dilated 1:10^5 and gave 4 pluses on K. Hmm, no, actually, the way it's worded, each half is tested separately. So half of the bacteria plates show 40 pluses on B, and the other half shows 4 pluses on K.\n\nNow, I remember that in such experiments, the number of successful lytic fission events relates to the probability of recombination between the two mutations. If the two mutations are perfectly recombinant, you'd expect some specific outcome, like a certain ratio of successful and unsuccessful infections.\n\nIn the case where the two mutations are perfectly recombined, the phage would integrate into the host chromosome without causing any issues, right? Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage integrates, and if it has a mutation, it might not replicate properly. But if the phage has a mutation in the lysogenic site and the integration site, perhaps the combination could affect replication.\n\nBut here, since both mutants are present, we're looking at whether their placement on the chromosome leads to recombination during integration or during replication.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the chance of the lysogenic phage successfully integrating is higher than if there's partial recombination. However, in our case, the phage isn't just about integration; it's also about replication.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. In E. coli, when a phage integrates, it has two sites for replication: the lysogenic site (where the phage DNA is) and the prophage site. If there's recombination between these two sites, it affects how the phage replicates.\n\nBut in this scenario, the two mutations are in the same phage (T_4). So, if the phage has a mutation in the lysogenic site and a mutation in the prophage site, depending on their location on the chromosome, they could cause either successful or unsuccessful replication.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the presence of both mutations may lead to a situation where the phage cannot integrate properly or replicate without causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment measures the success of the phage in replicating within the host cells. If the two mutations are recombined, the phage might be less likely to replicate because it has two incompatible sites for replication.\n\nSo, let's model this. Suppose the probability of the phage replicating successfully given a certain level of recombination is P. For example, if there's no recombination, the phage might replicate more easily, leading to more lysogenic fission events. As recombination increases, P decreases.\n\nIn an ideal scenario without recombination, all phages would replicate successfully, and all would cause lysogenic fission. But in reality, there's always some degree of recombination, so some phages won't replicate well, leading to fewer lysogenic fission events.\n\nGiven that, in our experiment, when the phages were tested on strain B, 40% of the plasmids caused lysogeny (lytic fission). When tested on strain K, only 10% did (since 4/40 = 0.1 or 10%).\n\nThis suggests that the recombination between the two mutations is such that only 10% of the phages integrated successfully and replicated without causing issues. Alternatively, the presence of recombination makes the phages less likely to replicate successfully.\n\nWait, but wait. The question is asking about the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So, I need to calculate the percentage of time the two mutations were placed on the same chromatid (recombination) versus different chromatids (no recombination).\n\nAssuming that the expected number of successful replication depends on the level of recombination. If recombination occurs frequently, the phage has two incompatible sites for replication, making it less likely to replicate successfully.\n\nLet\u2019s consider the expected outcomes:\n\n- No recombination (two intact chromatids): Phage should integrate and replicate successfully, giving high lysogeny.\n- Recombination (two chromatids): Phage has two incompatible sites, so replication is less efficient, leading to lower lysogeny.\n\nIn our experiment, the phage wasn\u2019t integrated into the host genome as often as expected. It replicated less successfully when the phage had recombination.\n\nGiven that, when testing on strain B, the plasmids were more likely to integrate and replicate, leading to higher lysogeny (more pluses). When tested on strain K, the plasmids were less likely to integrate and replicate, leading to fewer pluses.\n\nTo relate this to the amount of recombination, we can assume that the observed rate of successful replication corresponds to a certain level of recombination frequency.\n\nSuppose that the maximum possible lysogeny (all phages successfully replicated) is 100%, corresponding to zero recombination. As recombination increases, the lysogeny drops.\n\nWe have 40 pluses on strain B and 4 on strain K. That means that on strain B, the phages integrated and replicated 40% of the time, while on strain K, only 10% did.\n\nAssuming that the fraction of successful replication is proportional to the square root of the recombination frequency (assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium), but that might complicate things. Alternatively, if the level of recombination determines the fraction of successful replication, say R is the recombination frequency, and S(R) is the success rate, then S(R) = 1 - kR, where k is a constant.\n\nBut without knowing the exact relationship, perhaps we can use the fact that the difference between the two plasmids indicates the level of recombination.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of successful plasmids on B is four times that on K, it suggests that the recombination is significant enough to reduce the lysogeny on B but not too much to reduce it on K.\n\nLooking at the options provided: A through H, with varying percentages.\n\nSince the problem asks for the amount of recombination, and the answer choices are in percentage points, probably around 1-2%.\n\nGiven that 40% and 10% suggest moderate recombination, perhaps around 1.5% or 2%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which is a different species, both mutations cause issues\u2014so maybe the lysogenic phage from strain B can't handle strain K's replication? Or vice versa?\n\nThe experiment involves a double infection of strain B. They plate it twice: once dilute 1:10^7 and another dilute 1:10^5. The first gives a half that's saturated, then diluted again, and the second half is more concentrated. Then these plasmids are plated on strain B and K respectively. \n\nFrom the results:\n- On strain B, there are 40 pluses (lytic fission).\n- On strain K, there are 4 pluses.\n\nWait, I think I might have misread that. The problem says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B.\" So the first half was dilated 1:10^7 and led to 40 pluses on B, and the second half was dilated 1:10^5 and gave 4 pluses on K. Hmm, no, actually, the way it's worded, each half is tested separately. So half of the bacteria plates show 40 pluses on B, and the other half shows 4 pluses on K.\n\nNow, I remember that in such experiments, the number of successful lytic fission events relates to the probability of recombination between the two mutations. If the two mutations are perfectly recombinant, you'd expect some specific outcome, like a certain ratio of successful and unsuccessful infections.\n\nIn the case where the two mutations are perfectly recombined, the phage would integrate into the host chromosome without causing any issues, right? Wait, no\u2014the lysogenic phage integrates, and if it has a mutation, it might not replicate properly. But if the phage has a mutation in the lysogenic site and the integration site, perhaps the combination could affect replication.\n\nBut here, since both mutants are present, we're looking at whether their placement on the chromosome leads to recombination during integration or during replication.\n\nIf the two mutations are completely independent (no recombination), then the chance of the lysogenic phage successfully integrating is higher than if there's partial recombination. However, in our case, the phage isn't just about integration; it's also about replication.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to recall. In E. coli, when a phage integrates, it has two sites for replication: the lysogenic site (where the phage DNA is) and the prophage site. If there's recombination between these two sites, it affects how the phage replicates.\n\nBut in this scenario, the two mutations are in the same phage (T_4). So, if the phage has a mutation in the lysogenic site and a mutation in the prophage site, depending on their location on the chromosome, they could cause either successful or unsuccessful replication.\n\nHowever, the key point is that the presence of both mutations may lead to a situation where the phage cannot integrate properly or replicate without causing issues.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the experiment measures the success of the phage in replicating within the host cells. If the two mutations are recombined, the phage might be less likely to replicate because it has two incompatible sites for replication.\n\nSo, let's model this. Suppose the probability of the phage replicating successfully given a certain level of recombination is P. For example, if there's no recombination, the phage might replicate more easily, leading to more lysogenic fission events. As recombination increases, P decreases.\n\nIn an ideal scenario without recombination, all phages would replicate successfully, and all would cause lysogenic fission.

Since only the lysogenic phage affected strain B, but not K, the recombination must be such that it's not happening at random in B but perhaps favoring it.\n\nLooking at the data, the number of plumes on B's lawn is four, which suggests that the lysogenic phage caused an issue here. Similarly, four plumes on K's lawn indicate that the lysogenic phage didn't affect K. So, the lysogenic phage isn't causing any problems with either strain, implying that the recombination is low.\n\nWait, no. Wait, actually, let me think again. If the lysogenic phage (the one that doesn't lyse) isn't causing issues, it means that recombination hasn't happened. Because if recombination had occurred, the lysogenic phage would now carry both mutations, potentially causing issues like double resistance or different effects.\n\nBut according to the problem statement, the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lysis, so maybe the double phage effect isn't observed. Hmm, but wait, in reality, double phage mutants usually do cause issues, so perhaps the lack of lysis indicates that recombination is minimal.\n\nNow, looking at the numbers, four plumes on B and four on K. Each plume represents an independent occurrence. Assuming that without recombination, the lysogenic phage wouldn't cause issues, but when recombined, it might. However, since the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues, it suggests that recombination isn't occurring as much as it should.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, we can use the formula:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant colonies)/(Total number of colonies)\n\nBut in this case, the total colonies are 8 (four on B and four on K), and the recombinant colonies are zero because the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause issues, the recombination must be very low. The number of plumes on B is four, suggesting that the lysogenic phage is somehow contributing, but the fact that it doesn't cause issues implies that recombination isn't happening much.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the dilution factors. The first plate is diluted 1:10^7, leading to 4 plumes, and the second is 1:10^5, leading to 4 plumes on B and 4 on K. The ratio of plumes is similar, but without recombination, you'd expect fewer plumes on the higher dilution. If there was significant recombination, you might see fewer plumes overall, especially on the lower dilution.\n\nSince on the higher dilution (1:10^7), there were 4 plumes, and on the lower dilution (1:10^5), there were also 4 on B and 4 on K, it suggests that recombination is low. In fact, the presence of plumes at both dilutions supports low recombination because high recombination would lead to more uniform plumes at lower dilutions.\n\nGiven that the recombination frequency is calculated as the proportion of plumes at the lowest dilution, which is 4 out of 8, that's 50%. But since the answer options don't include 50%, and the correct calculation should consider the expected number under low recombination, the actual recombination frequency is likely very low, say around 0.5%.\n\nWait, but the options given go down to 0.005% (I see H is 5%, G is 0.5%). The initial calculation of 50% seems too high, so I must have made a mistake. Perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that without recombination, you'd expect fewer plumes at the lower dilution. Since there are four plumes at both dilutions, it suggests that recombination is low, possibly around 0.05% or 0.02%.\n\nLooking back, the answer options include D (0.05%) and F (0.3%), but my earlier reasoning suggested 0.5%. However, none of the options match exactly. The closest is D (0.05%) or F (0.3%). Given that the data shows a 50% distribution, but the possible answers suggest a lower frequency, I might have misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C (1.5%) or others, but I'm getting confused.\n\nPerhaps a better way is to realize that when two mutations are present, the probability of recombination is given by the product of the frequencies of each mutation. If the frequency of the lysogenic phage mutation is p and the wild type is q, then the recombination frequency is p*q.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage doesn't cause issues, then p*q must be very small. If the plumes are evenly distributed, p*q equals the number of plumes at the highest dilution divided by the total. Wait, I'm getting tangled here. Let me try a simpler approach.\n\nAssuming that the lysogenic phage doesn't cause issues, the recombination frequency must be low. The number of plumes at each dilution depends on the likelihood of recombination. At the higher dilution (1:10^7), you get 4 plumes, while at the lower (1:10^5), you get 4 on B and 4 on K. This suggests that recombination isn't occurring much, so the recombination frequency is low.\n\nGiven the options, 0.05% (D) or 0.02% (I) seem plausible, but the exact value depends on the precise calculation.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, both phages work normally. \n\nSo, the experiment has two plates. One is dilute enough that half of the colonies are killed and then diluted further into a 1:10^7 concentration. These are plated on strain B's lawn. On this plate, there are four plumes or clusters showing up, meaning four colonies form. Then, another half is dilute, 1:10^5, and these are plated on strain K's lawn.

On the first plate, 4 pluses were found on B, meaning 4 cells had the mutation. On the second plate, 40 pluses were found on K. \n\nWait, actually, maybe I should clarify: the initial culture is a mix of the two mutantphages. Each phage type has a certain probability of being present in a cell. Since they're equally likely, there's a 50% chance each phage type is present. So the total number of mutated cells would be the sum of cells with only one mutation plus those with both. \n\nIn the first dilution (1:10^7), the density is high enough that most cells will have either no mutations or one mutation. But since some cells have both, the actual count might be higher than expected if we just looked at either mutation alone. However, because the two mutations are independent, the probability of both appearing in the same cell is the product of their individual probabilities. If each mutation occurs in 50% of the cells, then the probability of both is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, or 25%.\n\nBut wait, in the experiment, how do these probabilities translate into pluses? For the first plate, 4 pluses were found on B, which suggests that 4 cells had the lysogenic mutation. Similarly, on the second plate, 40 pluses were found on K, indicating 40 cells had the phage carrying mutation in the lysogenic form. Wait, no\u2014actually, the phage carrying mutation could be either lysogenic or phage-specific, depending on what caused the problem.\n\nHold on, let me get this straight. The phage carrying mutations can lead to different outcomes. Phage-specific mutations typically cause lysogeny, while phage-like mutations cause lysiosis. In this case, the lysogenic phage (mutated) leads to cell lysis, whereas the phage-specific mutation may not affect lysosins, so the lysogenic effect wouldn't occur. Therefore, the lysogenic phage carries the mutation that leads to lytic fission, and the phage-specific carries the mutation that leads to lysogenic fission.\n\nWhen both are present, recombination occurs, leading to double-stranded phage DNA. This can interfere with replication and affect growth. So, in the experiment, the presence of both mutations in a cell would cause more rapid growth, perhaps leading to cell death or increased death rates compared to cells without either mutation.\n\nNow, regarding the experimental results. When the first plate was plated on strain B, 4 pluses were found. These correspond to cells where the lysogenic phage was present. On the second plate, 40 pluses were found on strain K, corresponding to cells with the phage-specific mutation. \n\nWait, but why did the second plate have more pluses? Because if the phage-specific mutation leads to less lysis, then cells with this mutation would die more easily. So, if you plate them on strain B, which is more susceptible to lysogenic phages, the cells with the phage-specific mutation would die more quickly and thus fewer pluses would appear. Conversely, if you plate them on strain K, which is more resistant to lysogenic phages, the cells with the lysogenic phage would die more slowly, resulting in more pluses.\n\nSo, the counts indicate that the phage-specific mutation leads to more deaths (pluses), implying it's more common. That makes sense because lysogenic phages preferentially infect more resistant bacteria. So, the probability of the phage-specific mutation being present in a cell is lower than that of the lysogenic mutation.\n\nGiven that, when both mutations are present, the likelihood of recombination increases, leading to faster growth and possibly more cell death, hence more pluses in the respective plates.\n\nNow, to calculate the recombination frequency. Recombination refers to the occurrence of a crossover event during meiosis. However, in phage genetics, recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two phages. In this context, it's about the interaction between the lysogenic and phage-specific mutations. The recombination frequency here would indicate the proportion of cells where both mutations occurred.\n\nSince each mutation occurs in 50% of the cells independently, the probability of both occurring in the same cell is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%. However, in practice, due to random segregation during cell division, the observed recombination would reflect this probability.\n\nLooking back at the data, when the first plate was plated on B, 4 pluses were found. Assuming that the lysogenic mutation is responsible for the plus, this corresponds to cells where the lysogenic phage is present. Similarly, on the second plate, 40 pluses on K suggest 40 cells with the phage-specific mutation. \n\nIf the mutations are independent, the expected number of pluses on B would be 50% of the cells, assuming all cells have either mutation. But in reality, some cells have both, which contributes additional pluses. Similarly, on K, cells with the phage-specific mutation contribute pluses.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation requires knowing the base rate of each mutation. If the lysogenic mutation occurs in x% of cells and the phage-specific in y%, and they are independent, then the expected number of pluses on each plate depends on the combination of these probabilities.\n\nBut since the experiment shows specific counts, perhaps we can infer the recombination frequency directly. Given that the lysogenic mutation leads to a plus in the first plate, and the phage-specific leads to a plus in the second plate, the combined occurrence implies recombination.\n\nAssuming each mutation occurs in approximately 50% of the cells, the probability of both occurring is 25%.

Wait, no\u2014the problem says that both mutations are present, so maybe the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues here?\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the bacteria into two groups: half dilated at 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half dilated at 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Then, four plques are found on strain K, and 40 on B. \n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, then why would the lysogenic phage affect the lytic group? Maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate or lyse, so it doesn't cause division. So only the lysogenic phage would be problematic when it's not being replicated.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In this case, the T_4 genome has two mutations. If these mutations were recombined, the phage might have different outcomes depending on where the replication occurs.\n\nIn the first scenario (diluted 1:10^7), the lysogenic phage should not cause issues, so all the plques should come from the lysogenic phage. However, in reality, there are plques from both, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating and causing issues. Similarly, when the phage is diluted less (1:10^5), more plques appear, indicating replication.\n\nNow, when the lysogenic phage replicates, it could lead to different effects depending on whether it replicates before or after the lysogenic phage itself. This is similar to the concept of co-duplication versus mutual duplication. In co-duplication, both phages replicate within the same host. In mutual duplication, each phage copies the other.\n\nIf the mutations are recombined, this would mean that the presence of one mutation affects the replication of the other. So, for example, if the lysogenic phage requires the T_4 phage to replicate before it can function, then the presence of one mutation would influence the replication of the other.\n\nTo determine the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\n% Recombination = [(P1 + P2 - P_combined) / P_combined] * 100%\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and P_combined is the probability of both occurring together under normal conditions without recombination.\n\nAssuming that normally (without recombination), the chance of one mutation is high, say p, and the other is q. Without recombination, their occurrence is independent, so the combined probability is pq. With recombination, their occurrence becomes dependent, so the combined probability becomes p*q*(probability of recombination).\n\nFrom the data, when the phage is highly diluted (1:10^7), some plques occur, suggesting replication. When less diluted (1:10^5), more plques occur, indicating higher replication rates.\n\nLooking at the results: On B, the low dilution (1:10^5) leads to more plques (40 vs 4). This indicates higher replication rate. On K, the high dilution (1:10^7) leads to fewer plques (40 vs 40?), wait, actually, the counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps when the phage is more dilute, it takes longer to replicate. So if the mutations are linked, the higher replication rate in lower dilution would indicate that the phage is replicating more frequently due to recombination. Alternatively, if recombination occurred, the replication might proceed faster because parts of the T_4 phage can now copy the DNA segments caused by the other mutation.\n\nLet me think about the expected values. Normally, without recombination, the number of plques should depend on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. But with recombination, the effect might amplify.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for double mutant efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/(1 - p1*p2)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nWait, another approach: The ratio of plques at different dilutions can help estimate the recombination fraction. The idea is that when recombination occurs, the replication of one mutation depends on the presence of the other mutation. So, the probability of replication increases when both mutations are present.\n\nSo, if R is the recombination frequency, then the observed plque numbers would reflect this dependence. For example, when the phage is highly diluted, the replication is slower, meaning lower efficiency, while when less diluted, replication is faster, meaning higher efficiency.\n\nGiven that on K, the high dilution (1:10^7) shows fewer plques (40), which is lower than expected without recombination, it suggests that recombination reduces the efficiency. Conversely, on B, the low dilution (1:10^5) shows more plques (40 vs 4), which is higher than expected, suggesting increased replication.\n\nSo, the recombination would reduce the efficiency when both mutations are present. To calculate the exact recombination frequency, I can set up an equation based on the observed plque counts.\n\nAssume that under normal circumstances (no recombination), the number of plques would be proportional to (p1 + p2 - p1*p2). With recombination, it might change accordingly.\n\nBut I'm getting a bit stuck. Maybe I should look for a simpler way. Since the problem provides specific numbers, perhaps I can use those to find the recombination frequency.\n\nLooking at the data, when the phage is highly diluted (1:10^7), you get 4 plques on K and 40 on B. That seems like a significant decrease compared to what would be expected. On the other hand, when the phage is less diluted (1:10^5), you get 40 plques on K and 4 on B. That's a much higher number.\n\nThis suggests that at lower dilution levels, the phage is replicating more rapidly, implying that recombination has allowed the DNA segments created by one mutation to now facilitate replication of the other. Therefore, the presence of both mutations allows for faster replication when they are close together.\n\nTo quantify the recombination frequency, let's consider the following: At higher dilutions (more rapid replication), the chance of both mutations affecting replication decreases. At lower dilutions, the chance increases. So, the recombination frequency R can be estimated by the difference in plque counts between the two dilutions.\n\nUsing the formula for the efficiency of double mutants:\n\nEfficiency = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/(1 - p1*p2)\n\nBut since p1 and p2 are small, this simplifies to approximately (p1 + p2)/ (1 - p1*p2). But I'm not sure if this helps directly.\n\nAlternatively, considering the likelihood of replication given recombination. If recombination happens at frequency R, then the effective plique count at each dilution would be adjusted based on R.\n\nAt very high dilution (R ~ 0), the plques would follow the non-recombined case: Plque_count \u2248 (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/(1 - p1*p2)\nAt moderate dilution, Plque_count \u2248 (p1 + p2 - R*p1*p2)/(1 - R*p1*p2)\nAt very low dilution, Plque_count \u2248 (p1 + p2 - R^2*p1*p2)/(1 - R^2*p1*p2)\n\nBut without knowing the actual p1 and p2, it's tricky. Maybe I can make assumptions based on the data.\n\nWhen the phage is highly diluted (1:10^7), the plques are 4, which is significantly lower than expected. At 1:10^5, it's 40, which is much higher. This indicates that at lower dilutions, the recombination allows the phage to replicate more effectively, hence more plques.\n\nThe ratio of plques at low to high dilution is 40/4=10. So, the replication is ten times more efficient at lower dilution.\n\nAssuming that the efficiency is related to the square root of the dilution factor (since efficiency scales with sqrt(dilution)), but I'm not certain.\n\nAnother approach: The expected number of plques can be modeled as a Poisson process. The expected number of plques at each dilution level would depend on the product of the probabilities of each mutation occurring, possibly adjusted by recombination.\n\nBut I'm overcomplicating it. Perhaps a simpler method is to recognize that the recombination frequency R can be approximated by the ratio of plques at different dilutions. Specifically, R = (plques_high_dilution / plques_low_dilution)^2.\n\nWait, that might make sense because if plques increase by a factor of 10 when diluting from 1e7 to 1e5, then R would be 1/100, which is 1%, matching option A.\n\nThat seems plausible. So R = (40/4)^(-1) = (10)^(-1)=0.1, which is 10%. But none of the options is 10%. Wait, looking back at the options: F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, etc., up to J being 0.05%.\n\nHmm, perhaps my assumption is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe R is calculated differently.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is R = (plques_at_low_dilution / plques_at_high_dilution)^(1/2). So 40/40=1, so R=1. That doesn't make sense.\n\nAlternatively, maybe R = (plques_at_high_dilution / plques_at_low_dilution)^(1/2). So 4/40=0.1, square root is 0.316, about 0.3%, which matches option F.\n\nYes, that sounds reasonable. So R \u2248 0.3%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they're not present, the lysogenic phage shouldn't cause issues either? Wait, no\u2014the problem says that both mutations are present, so maybe the lysogenic phage isn't causing issues here?\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the bacteria into two groups: half dilated at 1:10^7 and plated on strain B, and the other half dilated at 1:10^5 and plated on strain K. Then, four plques are found on strain K, and 40 on B. \n\nWait, but if the lysogenic phage doesn't cause lytic fission, then why would the lysogenic phage affect the lytic group? Maybe the lysogenic phage doesn't replicate or lyse, so it doesn't cause division. So only the lysogenic phage would be problematic when it's not being replicated.\n\nBut how does this relate to recombination? Recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material between two regions. In this case, the T_4 genome has two mutations. If these mutations were recombined, the phage might have different outcomes depending on where the replication occurs.\n\nIn the first scenario (diluted 1:10^7), the lysogenic phage should not cause issues, so all the plques should come from the lysogenic phage. However, in reality, there are plques from both, which suggests that the lysogenic phage is replicating and causing issues. Similarly, when the phage is diluted less (1:10^5), more plques appear, indicating replication.\n\nNow, when the lysogenic phage replicates, it could lead to different effects depending on whether it replicates before or after the lysogenic phage itself. This is similar to the concept of co-duplication versus mutual duplication. In co-duplication, both phages replicate within the same host. In mutual duplication, each phage copies the other.\n\nIf the mutations are recombined, this would mean that the presence of one mutation affects the replication of the other. So, for example, if the lysogenic phage requires the T_4 phage to replicate before it can function, then the presence of one mutation would influence the replication of the other.\n\nTo determine the percentage recombination, we can use the formula:\n\n% Recombination = [(P1 + P2 - P_combined) / P_combined] * 100%\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are the probabilities of each mutation occurring independently, and P_combined is the probability of both occurring together under normal conditions without recombination.\n\nAssuming that normally (without recombination), the chance of one mutation is high, say p, and the other is q. Without recombination, their occurrence is independent, so the combined probability is pq. With recombination, their occurrence becomes dependent, so the combined probability becomes p*q*(probability of recombination).\n\nFrom the data, when the phage is highly diluted (1:10^7), some plques occur, suggesting replication. When less diluted (1:10^5), more plques occur, indicating higher replication rates.\n\nLooking at the results: On B, the low dilution (1:10^5) leads to more plques (40 vs 4). This indicates higher replication rate. On K, the high dilution (1:10^7) leads to fewer plques (40 vs 40?), wait, actually, the counts are 40 on B and 4 on K. Hmm, maybe I'm misinterpreting.\n\nWait, perhaps when the phage is more dilute, it takes longer to replicate. So if the mutations are linked, the higher replication rate in lower dilution would indicate that the phage is replicating more frequently due to recombination. Alternatively, if recombination occurred, the replication might proceed faster because parts of the T_4 phage can now copy the DNA segments caused by the other mutation.\n\nLet me think about the expected values. Normally, without recombination, the number of plques should depend on the product of the frequencies of the two mutations. But with recombination, the effect might amplify.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for double mutant efficiency:\n\nEfficiency = (p1 + p2 - p1*p2)/(1 - p1*p2)\n\nBut I'm not sure if that applies directly here.\n\nWait, another approach: The ratio of plques at different dilutions can help estimate the recombination fraction. The idea is that when recombination occurs, the replication of one mutation depends on the presence of the other mutation. So, the probability of replication increases when both mutations are present.\n\nSo, if R is the recombination frequency, then the observed plque numbers would reflect this dependence. For example, when the phage is highly diluted, the replication is slower, meaning lower efficiency, while when less diluted, replication is faster, meaning higher efficiency.\n\nGiven that on K, the high dilution (1:10^7) shows fewer plques (40), which is lower than expected without recombination, it suggests that recombination reduces the efficiency. Conversely, on B, the low dilution (1:10^5) shows more plques (40 vs 4), which is higher than expected, suggesting increased replication.\n\nSo, the recombination would reduce the efficiency when both mutations are present.

    "rollout": " But when strain K is used, both phages work well, meaning no lysis occurs.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the E. coli into two groups: half is treated with a high-dilution medium (1:10^7), which should cause some colonies to die, indicating successful lysogeny. The remaining half is treated with a lower-dilution medium (1:10^5), leading to more colonies surviving, suggesting less lysis or better compatibility.\n\nIn the first group (high dilution, 1:10^7), four colonies form a precipitate when plated on strain B's lawn. This suggests that these colonies have successfully acquired the mutation from the lysogenic phage, as they replicate and survive despite being exposed to the lysogenic phage.\n\nIn the second group (low dilution, 1:10^5), 40 colonies form a precipitate when plated on strain K's lawn. Since strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, these colonies should be free of the mutation, as they would not be affected by the lysogenic phage.\n\nNow, the key here is recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of two different genes, which can lead to new combinations. In phages, this often means the combination of two different mutations allows them to infect E. coli in ways that aren't possible with either mutation alone.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- High dilution: 4 colonies. These likely represent plasmid replication, where the lysogenic phage has taken up the T_4 DNA.\n- Low dilution: 40 colonies. If there were recombination, we might expect fewer survivors because the phage could potentially mix with another phage type, leading to incomplete infection.\n\nWait, actually, when there's recombination, the probability of successful infection decreases because the phage isn't fully compatible anymore. So if recombination occurred, the number of successful infections (plating on strain B for the low dilution group) would be lower than expected without recombination.\n\nIn this case, the high dilution group shows 4 colonies, and the low dilution group shows 40. Normally, without recombination, the low dilution group would have about the same number as the high dilution group, assuming each mutation contributes independently. However, with recombination, the low dilution group would have fewer because some infections are unsuccessful due to the mixture causing some failure.\n\nBut wait, in reality, when there's recombination, the number of successful infections would decrease because the phage isn't entirely compatible. So the ratio of high dilution to low dilution would change.\n\nLet me think about the formula for calculating the recombination frequency. It's usually given by:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals) * 100%\n\nIn this experiment, the high dilution group (which is supposed to show successful lysogeny) had 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (unsuccessful lysogeny) had 40. But since both groups are testing the same two mutations, the total number of colonies is 4 + 40 = 44. However, typically, you'd expect the high dilution group to have more survivors, but perhaps in this case, the high dilution group has fewer due to recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Actually, without recombination, both groups should have similar numbers because each mutation affects the phage differently. With recombination, the phage can integrate the two mutations, making it incompatible with the host. Therefore, when tested against the phage, it won't infect as much, leading to fewer colonies in the low dilution group.\n\nSo if there's recombination, the number of colonies in the low dilution group would be lower than expected. Here, it's 40 instead of what would be expected without recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, let's consider that normally, both groups would have around the same number, say X. But with recombination, the low dilution group would have fewer because some phages don't infect properly. The exact calculation depends on how many are recombinants versus non-recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution group showed 4 colonies, and the low dilution group showed 40, the ratio of recombinant to total is higher in the low dilution group, suggesting more recombination.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation for recombinant ratios:\n\nRecomb freq = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total population)\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of recombinant individuals would be zero, and all would be from the two original mutations. With recombination, some will combine the two mutations.\n\nIf the high dilution group (which should be all lysogenic) shows 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (all plasmid replicating) shows 40 colonies, then the proportion of recombinants in the low dilution group would be 40/(4+40) = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%.\n\nThat seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the expectation is that if there's complete recombination, the low dilution group would have zero colonies, but in practice, sometimes some survive due to incomplete integration.\n\nHowever, in this case, 40 out of 44 colonies survived, which is quite high. That suggests that most of the phages integrated both mutations, making them incompatible with the host. Thus, the recombination frequency is high.\n\nCalculating recombination frequency using the observed data:\n\nTotal = 4 (high dilution) + 40 (low dilution) = 44\n\nRecombinant = 40\n\nRecomb freq = (40)/(44) * 100% \u2248 90.9%\n\nThis is very high, which doesn't match any of the options provided. Wait, the options go up to 0.5%, but my calculation gives over 90%. That must mean I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nPerhaps I've inverted the groups. Maybe the high dilution group (which should have been lysogenic) is actually showing non-lysogenic colonies, implying that the lysogenic phage is integrating the mutation with the plasmid, thus reducing its effectiveness.\n\nIf that's the case, then the high dilution group (4 colonies) represents recombinant phages, while the low dilution group (40 colonies) represents intact lysogenic phages. Then, the recombination frequency would be (4)/(4+40) * 100% = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%.\n\nStill, this is way above the highest option given (0.5%). Perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach, such as comparing the number of colonies in the two groups.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the number of recombinants relative to the total. Since the high dilution group (4) and low dilution group (40) are across two conditions, the recombination frequency can also be estimated as the difference between the two groups divided by the sum.\n\n(40 - 4)/44 = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%\n\nAgain, too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that in normal cases, without recombination, both groups should have the same number of colonies. If recombination occurs, one group would have fewer because some phages can't infect properly. So the ratio of the two groups would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nGiven that, the high dilution group has 4, and the low dilution group has 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. So for every 10 phages in the high dilution group, 1 survives, whereas in the low dilution group, 10 fail. This indicates a high degree of recombination.\n\nBut none of the answer choices go beyond 0.5%. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the actual number is calculated differently, like using the square root of the ratio of the smaller group to the larger group, which is \u221a(4/40) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%, which still doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct method is to use the number of recombinants divided by the total number of possible recombinants. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler. The number of recombinations per locus pair can be determined by the number of times the two mutations occur together. If we have a certain number of recombinant colonies, the percentage recombination can be approximated as the number of recombinant colonies multiplied by 100 divided by the total number of colonies.\n\nBut in this case, I'm getting 90% recombination, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the groups.\n\nMaybe the high dilution group should have more recombinant colonies, and the low dilution group should have fewer. So perhaps the high dilution group has 4 recombinant colonies, and the low dilution group has 40, making the total recombinants 4, and the total number of colonies 44. So recombination frequency is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which again is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compare the number of recombinants in each group relative to the expected under no recombination.\n\nUnder no recombination, both groups should have the same number of colonies, say N. But with recombination, the high dilution group would have fewer because some phages cannot infect. However, in our case, the high dilution group has fewer colonies (4) compared to the low dilution group (40), which suggests that recombination happened significantly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to see how many more colonies are present in the low dilution group compared to the high dilution group. The difference is 36. This suggests that 36 out of 44 phages are recombinants, leading to reduced infectivity. The recombination frequency can then be calculated as 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is again too high.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The standard formula for recombinant frequency is:\n\nRF = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nHere, RF = 40 / (4 + 40) = 40 / 44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. None of the options even reach close to 90%.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the groups. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Plates of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nAh! So the two groups are each split into two halves. One half is treated with high dilution (1:10^7), the other with low dilution (1:10^5).\n\nWhen the high dilution group is plated on strain B's lawn, it forms a precipitate. Similarly, the low dilution group is plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nFrom the results:\n- High dilution group (strain B): 4 colonies\n- Low dilution group (strain K): 40 colonies\n\nNow, strain K is E. coli without the lysogenic mutation, while strain B has the lysogenic mutation. So, in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage should have integrated into the phage DNA, leading to full lysogeny, hence fewer colonies. In the low dilution group, the phage is not present, so it shouldn't affect the lysogeny, expecting more colonies.\n\nBut why do we get 4 in the high dilution group? If there was no recombination, we would expect the same number of colonies in both groups. However, we're seeing more in the low dilution group, which implies that recombination occurred in the high dilution group, leading to fewer colonies.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage DNA, leading to a double-stranded region that prevents full replication. Therefore, when exposed to the lysogenic phage, the cells die, resulting in fewer colonies. In the low dilution group, the phage isn't present, so the lysogenic phage can infect the cells, leading to more colonies.\n\nSo, the presence of recombination in the high dilution group reduces the number of colonies, while in the low dilution group, the lack of recombination leads to more colonies.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of recombinant colonies to the total number of colonies.\n\nRecombinant colonies = 4 (high dilution)\nTotal colonies = 4 + 40 = 44\n\nRecombination frequency = (4 / 44) * 100 \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut this is still too high and doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of recombinants is the difference between the two groups. The high dilution group has 4, the low dilution group has 40, so the difference is 36. Assuming that the total number of possible recombinants is 36, and the total number of colonies is 44, the recombination frequency is 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which again is too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the \"amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" The options are percentages, so perhaps the answer is 1%, 2%, etc., but none of them match 90%. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the experimental design.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of recombination reduces the number of colonies in the high dilution group, as the phage integrates and inhibits replication. The increase in colonies in the low dilution group reflects the absence of recombination.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of recombinant colonies to the total is (4)/(4 + 40) = 4/44 = 0.0909, which is approximately 9%, but since the options don't include 9%, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct calculation is to find the number of recombinants in the high dilution group relative to the low dilution group. The high dilution group has 4 colonies, and the low dilution group has 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10, which suggests that only 1 out of every 10 phages in the high dilution group are recombinants, but in the low dilution group, all phages are intact.\n\nHowever, the recombination frequency is generally expressed as the percentage of phages that have integrated both mutations. So if 1 in 10 phages in the high dilution group have integrated both mutations, the recombination frequency would be 10%.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, the recombination frequency is 9%, which is closest to 10%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, I is 0.02%, J is 0.05%, and so on. So 10% isn't among them. The next closest is H at 5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. If the high dilution group has 4 colonies, and the low dilution group has 40, the difference is 36. If the recombination frequency is x%, then 36 = x% of (4 + 40). So 36 = (x/100)*44 \u2192 x = (36*100)/44 \u2248 81.8%. Again, over 90%, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should check the options again. The options are A through G, with D being 0.02%, E 0.05%, F 0.3%, G 0.5%, etc. None are near 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the initial assumption wrong. Maybe the high dilution group (which should have had full lysogeny) resulted in 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (no lysogeny) resulted in 40 colonies. That would imply that recombination led to the phage not being effective in the high dilution group, thus fewer colonies. But the difference is 36, which is 81.8% of the total, which is way too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinants is the difference between the two groups. If the high dilution group has 4 and the low dilution group has 40, the recombination frequency is (40 - 4)/(4 + 40) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, but that's still too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is to take the number of recombinants divided by the total number of individuals, which is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. Still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1%, but I'm not seeing how. Maybe the problem expects a simpler approach, such as noticing that the number of colonies in the high dilution group is 4, and the low dilution group is 40, which suggests that 40/4 = 10 times more colonies in the low dilution group. This could indicate a 10-fold reduction, which relates to a 100% recombination rate, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1% because 4 is 1% of 400, but that doesn't align with the numbers.\n\nI'm really confused now. Based on the calculations, the recombination frequency appears to be around 9%, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 1%, corresponding to option A, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombinants is 4 (from the high dilution group) plus 40 (from the low dilution group) minus the total, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that in the high dilution group, the phage integrates, leading to reduced infectivity, so the number of colonies corresponds to the efficiency of recombination.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when strain K is used, both phages work well, meaning no lysis occurs.\n\nThe experiment involves splitting the E. coli into two groups: half is treated with a high-dilution medium (1:10^7), which should cause some colonies to die, indicating successful lysogeny. The remaining half is treated with a lower-dilution medium (1:10^5), leading to more colonies surviving, suggesting less lysis or better compatibility.\n\nIn the first group (high dilution, 1:10^7), four colonies form a precipitate when plated on strain B's lawn. This suggests that these colonies have successfully acquired the mutation from the lysogenic phage, as they replicate and survive despite being exposed to the lysogenic phage.\n\nIn the second group (low dilution, 1:10^5), 40 colonies form a precipitate when plated on strain K's lawn. Since strain K doesn't have the lysogenic mutation, these colonies should be free of the mutation, as they would not be affected by the lysogenic phage.\n\nNow, the key here is recombination. Recombination refers to the mixing of two different genes, which can lead to new combinations. In phages, this often means the combination of two different mutations allows them to infect E. coli in ways that aren't possible with either mutation alone.\n\nLooking at the numbers:\n- High dilution: 4 colonies. These likely represent plasmid replication, where the lysogenic phage has taken up the T_4 DNA.\n- Low dilution: 40 colonies. If there were recombination, we might expect fewer survivors because the phage could potentially mix with another phage type, leading to incomplete infection.\n\nWait, actually, when there's recombination, the probability of successful infection decreases because the phage isn't fully compatible anymore. So if recombination occurred, the number of successful infections (plating on strain B for the low dilution group) would be lower than expected without recombination.\n\nIn this case, the high dilution group shows 4 colonies, and the low dilution group shows 40. Normally, without recombination, the low dilution group would have about the same number as the high dilution group, assuming each mutation contributes independently. However, with recombination, the low dilution group would have fewer because some infections are unsuccessful due to the mixture causing some failure.\n\nBut wait, in reality, when there's recombination, the number of successful infections would decrease because the phage isn't entirely compatible. So the ratio of high dilution to low dilution would change.\n\nLet me think about the formula for calculating the recombination frequency. It's usually given by:\n\nRecombination Frequency = (Number of recombinant individuals / Total number of individuals) * 100%\n\nIn this experiment, the high dilution group (which is supposed to show successful lysogeny) had 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (unsuccessful lysogeny) had 40. But since both groups are testing the same two mutations, the total number of colonies is 4 + 40 = 44. However, typically, you'd expect the high dilution group to have more survivors, but perhaps in this case, the high dilution group has fewer due to recombination.\n\nWait, maybe I'm getting this backwards. Actually, without recombination, both groups should have similar numbers because each mutation affects the phage differently. With recombination, the phage can integrate the two mutations, making it incompatible with the host. Therefore, when tested against the phage, it won't infect as much, leading to fewer colonies in the low dilution group.\n\nSo if there's recombination, the number of colonies in the low dilution group would be lower than expected. Here, it's 40 instead of what would be expected without recombination.\n\nTo calculate the recombination frequency, let's consider that normally, both groups would have around the same number, say X. But with recombination, the low dilution group would have fewer because some phages don't infect properly. The exact calculation depends on how many are recombinants versus non-recombinants.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the high dilution group showed 4 colonies, and the low dilution group showed 40, the ratio of recombinant to total is higher in the low dilution group, suggesting more recombination.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation for recombinant ratios:\n\nRecomb freq = (number of recombinant individuals) / (total population)\n\nAssuming that without recombination, the number of recombinant individuals would be zero, and all would be from the two original mutations. With recombination, some will combine the two mutations.\n\nIf the high dilution group (which should be all lysogenic) shows 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (all plasmid replicating) shows 40 colonies, then the proportion of recombinants in the low dilution group would be 40/(4+40) = 40/44 \u2248 90.9%.\n\nThat seems high. Alternatively, perhaps the expectation is that if there's complete recombination, the low dilution group would have zero colonies, but in practice, sometimes some survive due to incomplete integration.\n\nHowever, in this case, 40 out of 44 colonies survived, which is quite high. That suggests that most of the phages integrated both mutations, making them incompatible with the host. Thus, the recombination frequency is high.\n\nCalculating recombination frequency using the observed data:\n\nTotal = 4 (high dilution) + 40 (low dilution) = 44\n\nRecombinant = 40\n\nRecomb freq = (40)/(44) * 100% \u2248 90.9%\n\nThis is very high, which doesn't match any of the options provided. Wait, the options go up to 0.5%, but my calculation gives over 90%. That must mean I'm misunderstanding the setup.\n\nPerhaps I've inverted the groups. Maybe the high dilution group (which should have been lysogenic) is actually showing non-lysogenic colonies, implying that the lysogenic phage is integrating the mutation with the plasmid, thus reducing its effectiveness.\n\nIf that's the case, then the high dilution group (4 colonies) represents recombinant phages, while the low dilution group (40 colonies) represents intact lysogenic phages. Then, the recombination frequency would be (4)/(4+40) * 100% = 4/44 \u2248 9.09%.\n\nStill, this is way above the highest option given (0.5%). Perhaps the problem expects a simpler approach, such as comparing the number of colonies in the two groups.\n\nAnother approach is to look at the number of recombinants relative to the total. Since the high dilution group (4) and low dilution group (40) are across two conditions, the recombination frequency can also be estimated as the difference between the two groups divided by the sum.\n\n(40 - 4)/44 = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%\n\nAgain, too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to realize that in normal cases, without recombination, both groups should have the same number of colonies. If recombination occurs, one group would have fewer because some phages can't infect properly. So the ratio of the two groups would indicate the level of recombination.\n\nGiven that, the high dilution group has 4, and the low dilution group has 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10. So for every 10 phages in the high dilution group, 1 survives, whereas in the low dilution group, 10 fail. This indicates a high degree of recombination.\n\nBut none of the answer choices go beyond 0.5%. So perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the actual number is calculated differently, like using the square root of the ratio of the smaller group to the larger group, which is \u221a(4/40) \u2248 0.316, or 31.6%, which still doesn't match the options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct method is to use the number of recombinants divided by the total number of possible recombinants. But I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler. The number of recombinations per locus pair can be determined by the number of times the two mutations occur together. If we have a certain number of recombinant colonies, the percentage recombination can be approximated as the number of recombinant colonies multiplied by 100 divided by the total number of colonies.\n\nBut in this case, I'm getting 90% recombination, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the groups.\n\nMaybe the high dilution group should have more recombinant colonies, and the low dilution group should have fewer. So perhaps the high dilution group has 4 recombinant colonies, and the low dilution group has 40, making the total recombinants 4, and the total number of colonies 44. So recombination frequency is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%, which again is too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to compare the number of recombinants in each group relative to the expected under no recombination.\n\nUnder no recombination, both groups should have the same number of colonies, say N. But with recombination, the high dilution group would have fewer because some phages cannot infect. However, in our case, the high dilution group has fewer colonies (4) compared to the low dilution group (40), which suggests that recombination happened significantly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct way is to see how many more colonies are present in the low dilution group compared to the high dilution group. The difference is 36. This suggests that 36 out of 44 phages are recombinants, leading to reduced infectivity. The recombination frequency can then be calculated as 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which is again too high.\n\nI'm getting confused here. Let me try another approach. The standard formula for recombinant frequency is:\n\nRF = (Number of recombinant individuals) / (Total number of individuals)\n\nHere, RF = 40 / (4 + 40) = 40 / 44 \u2248 90.9%\n\nBut this doesn't match any of the options. None of the options even reach close to 90%.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I'm misinterpreting the groups. Let me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Plates of E. coli strain B is infected by two types of mutantphage simultaneously. The resultingly saturated divided in half. Half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated onto a lawn of E. coli strain K.\"\n\nAh! So the two groups are each split into two halves. One half is treated with high dilution (1:10^7), the other with low dilution (1:10^5).\n\nWhen the high dilution group is plated on strain B's lawn, it forms a precipitate. Similarly, the low dilution group is plated on strain K's lawn.\n\nFrom the results:\n- High dilution group (strain B): 4 colonies\n- Low dilution group (strain K): 40 colonies\n\nNow, strain K is E. coli without the lysogenic mutation, while strain B has the lysogenic mutation. So, in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage should have integrated into the phage DNA, leading to full lysogeny, hence fewer colonies. In the low dilution group, the phage is not present, so it shouldn't affect the lysogeny, expecting more colonies.\n\nBut why do we get 4 in the high dilution group? If there was no recombination, we would expect the same number of colonies in both groups. However, we're seeing more in the low dilution group, which implies that recombination occurred in the high dilution group, leading to fewer colonies.\n\nWait, actually, no. Because in the high dilution group, the lysogenic phage integrates into the phage DNA, leading to a double-stranded region that prevents full replication. Therefore, when exposed to the lysogenic phage, the cells die, resulting in fewer colonies. In the low dilution group, the phage isn't present, so the lysogenic phage can infect the cells, leading to more colonies.\n\nSo, the presence of recombination in the high dilution group reduces the number of colonies, while in the low dilution group, the lack of recombination leads to more colonies.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency can be estimated by the ratio of recombinant colonies to the total number of colonies.\n\nRecombinant colonies = 4 (high dilution)\nTotal colonies = 4 + 40 = 44\n\nRecombination frequency = (4 / 44) * 100 \u2248 9.09%\n\nBut this is still too high and doesn't match any of the options. Therefore, perhaps the intended approach is different.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the number of recombinants is the difference between the two groups. The high dilution group has 4, the low dilution group has 40, so the difference is 36. Assuming that the total number of possible recombinants is 36, and the total number of colonies is 44, the recombination frequency is 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, which again is too high.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. The question asks for the \"amount of recombination between the two mutations.\" The options are percentages, so perhaps the answer is 1%, 2%, etc., but none of them match 90%. Therefore, I must have misunderstood the experimental design.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the presence of recombination reduces the number of colonies in the high dilution group, as the phage integrates and inhibits replication. The increase in colonies in the low dilution group reflects the absence of recombination.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of recombinant colonies to the total is (4)/(4 + 40) = 4/44 = 0.0909, which is approximately 9%, but since the options don't include 9%, perhaps I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct calculation is to find the number of recombinants in the high dilution group relative to the low dilution group. The high dilution group has 4 colonies, and the low dilution group has 40. The ratio is 4:40 = 1:10, which suggests that only 1 out of every 10 phages in the high dilution group are recombinants, but in the low dilution group, all phages are intact.\n\nHowever, the recombination frequency is generally expressed as the percentage of phages that have integrated both mutations. So if 1 in 10 phages in the high dilution group have integrated both mutations, the recombination frequency would be 10%.\n\nBut according to the earlier calculation, the recombination frequency is 9%, which is closest to 10%. Looking at the options, F is 0.3%, G is 0.5%, H is 5%, I is 0.02%, J is 0.05%, and so on. So 10% isn't among them. The next closest is H at 5%.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to reconsider. If the high dilution group has 4 colonies, and the low dilution group has 40, the difference is 36. If the recombination frequency is x%, then 36 = x% of (4 + 40). So 36 = (x/100)*44 \u2192 x = (36*100)/44 \u2248 81.8%. Again, over 90%, which doesn't make sense.\n\nI'm stuck. Maybe I should check the options again. The options are A through G, with D being 0.02%, E 0.05%, F 0.3%, G 0.5%, etc. None are near 90%.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the initial assumption wrong. Maybe the high dilution group (which should have had full lysogeny) resulted in 4 colonies, and the low dilution group (no lysogeny) resulted in 40 colonies. That would imply that recombination led to the phage not being effective in the high dilution group, thus fewer colonies. But the difference is 36, which is 81.8% of the total, which is way too high.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of recombinants is the difference between the two groups. If the high dilution group has 4 and the low dilution group has 40, the recombination frequency is (40 - 4)/(4 + 40) = 36/44 \u2248 81.8%, but that's still too high.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is to take the number of recombinants divided by the total number of individuals, which is 4/44 \u2248 9.09%. Still not matching any options.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is 1%, but I'm not seeing how. Maybe the problem expects a simpler approach, such as noticing that the number of colonies in the high dilution group is 4, and the low dilution group is 40, which suggests that 40/4 = 10 times more colonies in the low dilution group. This could indicate a 10-fold reduction, which relates to a 100% recombination rate, but that's not an option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is 1% because 4 is 1% of 400, but that doesn't align with the numbers.\n\nI'm really confused now. Based on the calculations, the recombination frequency appears to be around 9%, which isn't listed. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is 1%, corresponding to option A, but I'm not confident.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the number of recombinants is 4 (from the high dilution group) plus 40 (from the low dilution group) minus the total, but that doesn't seem right.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to note that in the high dilution group, the phage integrates, leading to reduced infectivity, so the number of colonies corresponds to the efficiency of recombination.

However, the lytic phage does cause positive interference because it prevents the lysogenic phage from replicating effectively. \n\nSo, the presence of lysogenic phage leads to interference, reducing the likelihood of new phages replicating. Now, the recombination refers to how often these two mutations occur together on the same phage particle. High recombination would mean that the two mutations are on the same phage and likely present at the time of infection.\n\nRecombination frequency is usually measured in percentage. In this context, since the question provides options, we're looking for the percentage of recombination between the two mutations.\n\nThe key here is understanding that the number of plasmids on the lysogenic phage determines the likelihood of their occurrence relative to the lytic phage. The ratio of plasmids on lysogenic vs. lytic phage gives insight into the recombination fraction.\n\nSince the experiment shows that on strain K, four pluses are found, indicating that the lysogenic phage contributed to some plasmid loss, which is consistent with interference. The exact calculation requires knowing the ratio of plasmids before and after interference.\n\nAssuming the initial population is N, after interference, it becomes N * (1 - \u03b2). The number of plasmids on K is 4, and on B it's 16 (since half the colonies died initially and then half survived). So, the ratio is 4/16 = 0.25, implying that the effective plasmid copy number on K is 0.25 times that on B.\n\nUsing the formula for interference, \u03b2 = (N_before) / (N_after). If N_after = 0.25 N_before, then \u03b2 = 4. That seems too high, so maybe I inverted it. Alternatively, \u03b2 = (N_after)/(N_before), so 0.25.\n\nBut wait, the correct formula for interference is \u03b2 = 1 - (N_after / N_before). So if N_after is 0.25 N_before, then \u03b2 = 0.75.

Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But strain K isn't affected, which suggests that strain K has the lytic mutation or maybe both mutations don't affect it.\n\nThe experiment involves plates where E. coli strain B is infected first.

    "rollout": " But when they infect strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic feature, the phage doesn't cause any issues. So, the first experiment shows that both mutations don't affect strain B but do affect strain K.\n\nNow, the bacteria are split into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has a lot of DNA\u2014so fewer copies per plasmid. This is then plated on strain B's lawn. In this case, four plaques appear. Since the strain K's mutation isn't present there, it shouldn't be affected. On the other side, the same amount of plasmids (1:10^7) is placed on strain K's lawn, where four more plaques form. That suggests that some of the phage DNA is combining with the strain's DNA, indicating recombination.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination here means that the phage's mutated gene has combined with the host's wild-type gene. The key point is whether the phage's mutated region is present in the host's genome or if it's just integrated without changing the host's gene.\n\nLooking at the numbers, in the strain B area, four plaques mean that most of the phage DNA didn't integrate into the host's gene. However, in the strain K area, four plaques mean that some integration happened. Wait, no\u2014the split was such that half was tested on strain B and half on strain K. So, maybe all the phage DNA from both halves is used in the test? Or perhaps each half contains half the phage DNA, and each is tested separately.\n\nWait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So, the first half (diluted 1:10^7) is on strain B's lawn, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) is on strain K's lawn. The results are four plaques on B and four on K. \n\nIf the phage's mutated region integrates with the host's wild-type DNA, then the host's DNA would be less susceptible to the phage. So, when you plate the phage on strain B's lawn, the strain should die if the phage's DNA doesn't integrate. But since four plaques appeared, that suggests integration occurred in the strain B sample. Similarly, in the strain K sample, four plaques indicate some integration, but wait, the number is the same as strain B, which might imply that either it's a coincidence or that the integration rate is the same.\n\nBut actually, the half that was plated on strain K had lower dilution (1:10^5), meaning more DNA is available. If the recombination rate is high enough that even a small fraction of the phage DNA integrates, the presence of a few plaques could still happen.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the expected outcome under different conditions. If the recombination frequency is R, then the probability that a phage with the mutation integrates into the host is R. Without recombination, all phages would replicate independently, so more mutations would lead to higher death rates.\n\nIn the first experiment, when the phages were tested on strain B, the presence of four plaques indicates that some integration happened because without it, the phage would have replicated successfully and killed the bacterium. But in the second experiment, when the phages were tested on strain K, the absence of four plaques suggests that integration didn't occur there, meaning the mutation didn't cause problems when applied to strain K.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of plaques gives us an idea of how much integration occurs. The ratio of successful replication on strain B versus strain K tells us about the level of integration.\n\nLet me calculate the ratio of successes: strain B had four successes, strain K had four as well. Hmm, that's the same number, which might suggest that the recombination rate is low, but we're looking for the percentage of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that if the recombination rate is R, then the chance that a phage with the mutation integrates is R. The probability that a phage without the mutation integrates is (1 - R).\n\nWhen testing on strain B, the probability that the phage dies is (1 - R) + R * S, where S is the susceptibility due to the mutation. Wait, actually, without recombination, all phages would die, so if there's some integration, the die rate increases.\n\nBut in reality, the die rate depends on the combination of whether the phage's DNA is integrating into the host's. If there's recombination, the host's DNA becomes resistant to the phage because the phage's DNA has integrated into it.\n\nTherefore, the die rate when testing on strain B (which lacks the lysogenic mutation) should be higher than when testing on strain K (which also lacks the lysogenic mutation). But in our case, the die rate on strain B is zero (since four successes), while on strain K, it's four. Wait, no\u2014on strain B, the phages that die must have integrated into the host's gene, making them resistant. On strain K, the phages that die are those without integration, so they replicate normally.\n\nSo, the number of deaths corresponds to the number of phages that integrated into the host's gene. Therefore, the ratio of deaths on strain B to strain K gives us the ratio of recombinant phages to non-recombinant ones.\n\nBut in our data:\n\n- Strain B: 4 deaths\n- Strain K: 4 deaths\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the phage's mutation caused resistance only in strain B, then strain K would have fewer deaths. But here, both have the same number of deaths. Maybe the calculation involves the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) was on strain B, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) was on strain K. The presence of four deaths in both samples suggests that the integration rate is similar in both cases.\n\nAssuming that the number of deaths follows a binomial distribution, the expected number of deaths in the first half (strain B) would be n * p, where n is the number of phages and p is the probability of integration. For the second half, it would be n' * p', where n' is half the number of phages (since the dilution is 1:10^5 instead of 1:10^7).\n\nGiven that both experiments resulted in the same number of deaths, we can set up the equation: n * p = (n/2) * p'\n\nBut without knowing n, it's tricky. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, so the number of dead phages (resistant) would be proportional to R.\n\nSince both halves have the same number of dead phages, it implies that the recombination rate is the same in both cases. Thus, the amount of recombination is the same across both experiments.\n\nTo find the percentage, we can use the formula for recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is calculated as (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%.\n\nIn this case, when the phages are plated on strain B, the number of dead phages is 4. On strain K, it's also 4. Assuming equal numbers of phages, the proportion of recombinant phages is 4/(4+4) = 50%. Wait, but that's not possible because recombination can't exceed 100%, and the options given are much smaller percentages.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Another way is to consider that the recombination rate affects the number of times the phage's mutation integrates into the host's DNA. If the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, leading to increased susceptibility.\n\nIn the first experiment, when testing on strain B, which lacks the mutation, the phages that integrate become resistant, causing fewer deaths. But in our case, all phages died on strain B except none, implying complete integration. However, on strain K, none integrated, so no resistance, hence more deaths.\n\nWait, but both experiments resulted in four deaths. That suggests that the recombination rate is the same regardless of the host's mutation status. So, the amount of recombination is the same in both experiments, which implies it's consistent across both strains.\n\nTo compute the percentage, we can assume that the recombination rate is R, and the number of deaths is proportional to (1 - R). Since both experiments had the same number of deaths, it suggests that (1 - R) is the same for both, so R is the same in both.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to calculate R directly. However, considering the results, if the recombination rate is 0.05% (option D), then the probability of integration is 0.05%, leading to (1 - 0.0005) \u2248 99.95% survival. With a certain number of phages, say N, the expected number of dead phages would be N * 0.0005. If N is large, like 1e6, then 500 dead phages would be expected. But in our case, 4 dead phages, which is much lower. So maybe the recombination rate is higher.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.2% (option E), then (1 - 0.002) = 0.998, so with N=1e6, 2 dead phages. But again, we have 4 dead phages. So perhaps the recombination rate is around 0.02% (option J), giving 0.0002 survival, leading to 0.0002*N deaths. If N=1e6, that's 200 deaths, which is too many. If N=5e5, 100 deaths. Still too high. Wait, maybe the calculations are different.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the probability of recombination leading to the observed number of deaths. Suppose the number of phages is N. Then the expected number of dead phages on strain B would be N * (1 - R), and on strain K, N * R. Given that both experiments gave 4 deaths, we have N*(1-R)=N*R \u2192 1-R=R \u2192 R=0.5. But 0.5 is 50%, which isn't among the options. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the number of dead phages relates to the number of phages that successfully integrated. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and assuming N is the same, then 4 = N * R on both sides, which implies R is the same in both cases. But again, without knowing N, it's difficult to get a percentage.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem states that the results show that half the bacteria are divided into two groups: one treated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The number of plaques formed on each group can give insight into the recombination rate.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, leading to the host being resistant. The number of resistant phages would be proportional to R. If the number of resistant phages is 4 on both groups, and the number of phages in each group is the same, then R would be the same in both cases.\n\nHowever, in practice, the recombination rate is typically expressed as a percentage. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and the total number of phages in each group is the same, then R would be 4/N. But without knowing N, we can't determine R numerically.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of dead phages reflects the number of recombinants. If 4 phages died on each side, and the total number is the same, then R is 4/N. But unless N is known, we can't find R.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the phage's mutations that are recombined, not the recombination rate itself. So if the total number of mutations is, say, M, then R*M is the number of recombined mutations. But again, without knowing M, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the answer choices. They range from 0.02% to 5%. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and assuming N is large, say 1e6, then R would be 4e-6, which is 0.0004%, approximately 0.00004%, which is close to 0.0002%, which is option J. But 4e-6 is 0.0004%, which is 0.04%, which isn't listed. Option F is 0.3%, which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.02%, then R = 0.0002, leading to 4e-6 phages dying, which is 0.0002% of the population. That matches option J (0.0002%). But the answer choices don't include 0.0002%, so perhaps the intended answer is 0.02%, which is option J.\n\nWait, no\u2014the answer choices are letters representing percentages: A-F is 0.000001%, G-H is 0.000005%, etc., up to H:5%. So, if the recombination rate is 0.0002%, that's 0.0002%, which is option J:0.0002%. But the options are written as fractions of 1%, so 0.0002% is equivalent to 0.0002/100 = 0.000002. So, the correct letter would correspond to 0.0002%, which is option J.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of dead phages being 4 on both sides suggests R=4/N. If N is 1e6, then R=4e-6, which is 0.0004%, which is closer to 0.0002% than to 0.0005%. So, the closest match would be option J:0.0002%. Alternatively, if the answer expects a simpler calculation, perhaps taking the ratio of deaths, which is 4/4=1, suggesting 100% recombination, but that's not one of the options. So, perhaps the intended approach is to take the ratio of the number of dead phages to the total, which would give R=4/(total phages). But without knowing the total, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that the probability of a phage integrating is R, so the expected number of dead phages is N * (1 - R). If both experiments have the same number of dead phages, then N*(1 - R) = N*R \u21d2 1 - R = R \u21d2 R = 0.5. But 0.5 is not an option. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is very low, then R is small, and (1 - R) \u2248 1. So, the expected number of dead phages would be nearly N. But in our case, dead phages are 4, so N must be significantly larger than 4. So, perhaps the recombination rate is small, but we need to find what percentage it is.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation should involve the ratio of the number of dead phages on each strain. Since both have the same number of dead phages, the recombination rate is the same, so R is the same in both experiments. To express R as a percentage, multiply by 100. But without knowing R, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of dead phages is proportional to the recombination rate. If both experiments have the same number of dead phages, the recombination rate must be the same, so R is the same in both. To find R, we can assume that the number of dead phages equals N * R, where N is the number of phages. But without knowing N, it's impossible to find R numerically.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I should look for a pattern. The options are in the order of 0.000001% to 0.0005%. If the number of dead phages is 4, and assuming the number of phages is large, say 1e6, then R=4e-6, which is 0.0004%, corresponding to option J:0.0002%. But 4e-6 is exactly 0.0004%, which is halfway between 0.0002% and 0.0005%. So, depending on rounding, it could be considered as 0.0002% or 0.0005%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recombination rate is the same in both experiments, and since 4 phages died on each, and assuming the same number of phages in each group, the recombination rate is the same. To find the percentage, we can calculate R = 4 / (N * 2), but without N, it's still unknown.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of dead phages is proportional to the square root of the number of phages, but that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have the recombination rate R such that the number of dead phages is R * N. Since both experiments have the same number of dead phages, R must be the same. But without knowing N, we can\u2019t find R.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended answer is option J:0.0002%, assuming that the recombination rate is 0.0002%, leading to 4 phages dying out of a large population.\n\nAlternatively, considering that 4 phages died, and assuming the total number of phages is 1e6, then R=4e-6, which is 0.0004%. But since the options don't have 0.0004%, the closest would be option J:0.0002%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which doesn't have the lysogenic feature, the phage doesn't cause any issues. So, the first experiment shows that both mutations don't affect strain B but do affect strain K.\n\nNow, the bacteria are split into two halves. One half is diluted 1:10^7, meaning each plasmid has a lot of DNA\u2014so fewer copies per plasmid. This is then plated on strain B's lawn. In this case, four plaques appear. Since the strain K's mutation isn't present there, it shouldn't be affected. On the other side, the same amount of plasmids (1:10^7) is placed on strain K's lawn, where four more plaques form. That suggests that some of the phage DNA is combining with the strain's DNA, indicating recombination.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of recombination. Recombination here means that the phage's mutated gene has combined with the host's wild-type gene. The key point is whether the phage's mutated region is present in the host's genome or if it's just integrated without changing the host's gene.\n\nLooking at the numbers, in the strain B area, four plaques mean that most of the phage DNA didn't integrate into the host's gene. However, in the strain K area, four plaques mean that some integration happened. Wait, no\u2014the split was such that half was tested on strain B and half on strain K. So, maybe all the phage DNA from both halves is used in the test? Or perhaps each half contains half the phage DNA, and each is tested separately.\n\nWait, the description says \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain K.\" So, the first half (diluted 1:10^7) is on strain B's lawn, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) is on strain K's lawn. The results are four plaques on B and four on K. \n\nIf the phage's mutated region integrates with the host's wild-type DNA, then the host's DNA would be less susceptible to the phage. So, when you plate the phage on strain B's lawn, the strain should die if the phage's DNA doesn't integrate. But since four plaques appeared, that suggests integration occurred in the strain B sample. Similarly, in the strain K sample, four plaques indicate some integration, but wait, the number is the same as strain B, which might imply that either it's a coincidence or that the integration rate is the same.\n\nBut actually, the half that was plated on strain K had lower dilution (1:10^5), meaning more DNA is available. If the recombination rate is high enough that even a small fraction of the phage DNA integrates, the presence of a few plaques could still happen.\n\nAlternatively, let's think about the expected outcome under different conditions. If the recombination frequency is R, then the probability that a phage with the mutation integrates into the host is R. Without recombination, all phages would replicate independently, so more mutations would lead to higher death rates.\n\nIn the first experiment, when the phages were tested on strain B, the presence of four plaques indicates that some integration happened because without it, the phage would have replicated successfully and killed the bacterium. But in the second experiment, when the phages were tested on strain K, the absence of four plaques suggests that integration didn't occur there, meaning the mutation didn't cause problems when applied to strain K.\n\nSo, the difference in the number of plaques gives us an idea of how much integration occurs. The ratio of successful replication on strain B versus strain K tells us about the level of integration.\n\nLet me calculate the ratio of successes: strain B had four successes, strain K had four as well. Hmm, that's the same number, which might suggest that the recombination rate is low, but we're looking for the percentage of recombination.\n\nAnother approach is to consider that if the recombination rate is R, then the chance that a phage with the mutation integrates is R. The probability that a phage without the mutation integrates is (1 - R).\n\nWhen testing on strain B, the probability that the phage dies is (1 - R) + R * S, where S is the susceptibility due to the mutation. Wait, actually, without recombination, all phages would die, so if there's some integration, the die rate increases.\n\nBut in reality, the die rate depends on the combination of whether the phage's DNA is integrating into the host's. If there's recombination, the host's DNA becomes resistant to the phage because the phage's DNA has integrated into it.\n\nTherefore, the die rate when testing on strain B (which lacks the lysogenic mutation) should be higher than when testing on strain K (which also lacks the lysogenic mutation). But in our case, the die rate on strain B is zero (since four successes), while on strain K, it's four. Wait, no\u2014on strain B, the phages that die must have integrated into the host's gene, making them resistant. On strain K, the phages that die are those without integration, so they replicate normally.\n\nSo, the number of deaths corresponds to the number of phages that integrated into the host's gene. Therefore, the ratio of deaths on strain B to strain K gives us the ratio of recombinant phages to non-recombinant ones.\n\nBut in our data:\n\n- Strain B: 4 deaths\n- Strain K: 4 deaths\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. Because if the phage's mutation caused resistance only in strain B, then strain K would have fewer deaths. But here, both have the same number of deaths. Maybe the calculation involves the probabilities.\n\nAlternatively, considering the dilutions. The first half (diluted 1:10^7) was on strain B, and the second half (diluted 1:10^5) was on strain K. The presence of four deaths in both samples suggests that the integration rate is similar in both cases.\n\nAssuming that the number of deaths follows a binomial distribution, the expected number of deaths in the first half (strain B) would be n * p, where n is the number of phages and p is the probability of integration. For the second half, it would be n' * p', where n' is half the number of phages (since the dilution is 1:10^5 instead of 1:10^7).\n\nGiven that both experiments resulted in the same number of deaths, we can set up the equation: n * p = (n/2) * p'\n\nBut without knowing n, it's tricky. Alternatively, if the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, so the number of dead phages (resistant) would be proportional to R.\n\nSince both halves have the same number of dead phages, it implies that the recombination rate is the same in both cases. Thus, the amount of recombination is the same across both experiments.\n\nTo find the percentage, we can use the formula for recombination frequency. Recombination frequency is calculated as (number of recombinant offspring / total number of offspring) * 100%.\n\nIn this case, when the phages are plated on strain B, the number of dead phages is 4. On strain K, it's also 4. Assuming equal numbers of phages, the proportion of recombinant phages is 4/(4+4) = 50%. Wait, but that's not possible because recombination can't exceed 100%, and the options given are much smaller percentages.\n\nPerhaps I'm misunderstanding the setup. Another way is to consider that the recombination rate affects the number of times the phage's mutation integrates into the host's DNA. If the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, leading to increased susceptibility.\n\nIn the first experiment, when testing on strain B, which lacks the mutation, the phages that integrate become resistant, causing fewer deaths. But in our case, all phages died on strain B except none, implying complete integration. However, on strain K, none integrated, so no resistance, hence more deaths.\n\nWait, but both experiments resulted in four deaths. That suggests that the recombination rate is the same regardless of the host's mutation status. So, the amount of recombination is the same in both experiments, which implies it's consistent across both strains.\n\nTo compute the percentage, we can assume that the recombination rate is R, and the number of deaths is proportional to (1 - R). Since both experiments had the same number of deaths, it suggests that (1 - R) is the same for both, so R is the same in both.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard to calculate R directly. However, considering the results, if the recombination rate is 0.05% (option D), then the probability of integration is 0.05%, leading to (1 - 0.0005) \u2248 99.95% survival. With a certain number of phages, say N, the expected number of dead phages would be N * 0.0005. If N is large, like 1e6, then 500 dead phages would be expected. But in our case, 4 dead phages, which is much lower. So maybe the recombination rate is higher.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.2% (option E), then (1 - 0.002) = 0.998, so with N=1e6, 2 dead phages. But again, we have 4 dead phages. So perhaps the recombination rate is around 0.02% (option J), giving 0.0002 survival, leading to 0.0002*N deaths. If N=1e6, that's 200 deaths, which is too many. If N=5e5, 100 deaths. Still too high. Wait, maybe the calculations are different.\n\nAlternatively, using the formula for the probability of recombination leading to the observed number of deaths. Suppose the number of phages is N. Then the expected number of dead phages on strain B would be N * (1 - R), and on strain K, N * R. Given that both experiments gave 4 deaths, we have N*(1-R)=N*R \u2192 1-R=R \u2192 R=0.5. But 0.5 is 50%, which isn't among the options. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps the number of dead phages relates to the number of phages that successfully integrated. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and assuming N is the same, then 4 = N * R on both sides, which implies R is the same in both cases. But again, without knowing N, it's difficult to get a percentage.\n\nWait, another angle: the problem states that the results show that half the bacteria are divided into two groups: one treated on strain B, and the other on strain K. The number of plaques formed on each group can give insight into the recombination rate.\n\nIf the recombination rate is R, then the probability that a phage integrates is R, leading to the host being resistant. The number of resistant phages would be proportional to R. If the number of resistant phages is 4 on both groups, and the number of phages in each group is the same, then R would be the same in both cases.\n\nHowever, in practice, the recombination rate is typically expressed as a percentage. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and the total number of phages in each group is the same, then R would be 4/N. But without knowing N, we can't determine R numerically.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the number of dead phages reflects the number of recombinants. If 4 phages died on each side, and the total number is the same, then R is 4/N. But unless N is known, we can't find R.\n\nWait, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of the phage's mutations that are recombined, not the recombination rate itself. So if the total number of mutations is, say, M, then R*M is the number of recombined mutations. But again, without knowing M, it's unclear.\n\nPerhaps I'm overcomplicating it. Let's look at the answer choices. They range from 0.02% to 5%. If the number of dead phages is 4 on both sides, and assuming N is large, say 1e6, then R would be 4e-6, which is 0.0004%, approximately 0.00004%, which is close to 0.0002%, which is option J. But 4e-6 is 0.0004%, which is 0.04%, which isn't listed. Option F is 0.3%, which is larger.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is 0.02%, then R = 0.0002, leading to 4e-6 phages dying, which is 0.0002% of the population. That matches option J (0.0002%). But the answer choices don't include 0.0002%, so perhaps the intended answer is 0.02%, which is option J.\n\nWait, no\u2014the answer choices are letters representing percentages: A-F is 0.000001%, G-H is 0.000005%, etc., up to H:5%. So, if the recombination rate is 0.0002%, that's 0.0002%, which is option J:0.0002%. But the options are written as fractions of 1%, so 0.0002% is equivalent to 0.0002/100 = 0.000002. So, the correct letter would correspond to 0.0002%, which is option J.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that the number of dead phages being 4 on both sides suggests R=4/N. If N is 1e6, then R=4e-6, which is 0.0004%, which is closer to 0.0002% than to 0.0005%. So, the closest match would be option J:0.0002%. Alternatively, if the answer expects a simpler calculation, perhaps taking the ratio of deaths, which is 4/4=1, suggesting 100% recombination, but that's not one of the options. So, perhaps the intended approach is to take the ratio of the number of dead phages to the total, which would give R=4/(total phages). But without knowing the total, it's impossible.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct formula is that the probability of a phage integrating is R, so the expected number of dead phages is N * (1 - R). If both experiments have the same number of dead phages, then N*(1 - R) = N*R \u21d2 1 - R = R \u21d2 R = 0.5. But 0.5 is not an option. So that's not the case.\n\nAlternatively, if the recombination rate is very low, then R is small, and (1 - R) \u2248 1. So, the expected number of dead phages would be nearly N. But in our case, dead phages are 4, so N must be significantly larger than 4. So, perhaps the recombination rate is small, but we need to find what percentage it is.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation should involve the ratio of the number of dead phages on each strain. Since both have the same number of dead phages, the recombination rate is the same, so R is the same in both experiments. To express R as a percentage, multiply by 100. But without knowing R, it's hard.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to note that the number of dead phages is proportional to the recombination rate. If both experiments have the same number of dead phages, the recombination rate must be the same, so R is the same in both. To find R, we can assume that the number of dead phages equals N * R, where N is the number of phages. But without knowing N, it's impossible to find R numerically.\n\nThis is confusing.

So, depending on rounding, it could be considered as 0.0002% or 0.0005%.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem assumes that the recombination rate is the same in both experiments, and since 4 phages died on each, and assuming the same number of phages in each group, the recombination rate is the same. To find the percentage, we can calculate R = 4 / (N * 2), but without N, it's still unknown.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to consider that the number of dead phages is proportional to the square root of the number of phages, but that seems off.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is designed to have the recombination rate R such that the number of dead phages is R * N.

But since the options don't have 0.0004%, the closest would be option J:0.0002%.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option B:2 percent, thinking that the number of dead phages is 4, and the number of phages is 200, leading to 2 percent. But without knowing the total number, it's speculative.\n\nWait, maybe the calculation is simply",

Since the two mutant types are from different phages, their effects are independent unless there's recombination. In this case, the presence of plasmid replication is important. If the lysogenic phage can lyse the phage particle itself, then it would integrate into the host genome and become a prophage, allowing for better replication. That's the idea behind the \"double lysing\" test, where the presence of plasmid replication (like in phages like P. aeruginosa) allows the phage to lyse the phage particle, giving an advantage to the phage. \n\nBut back to the experiment. The fact that only strain B is affected means that the lysogenic phage didn't disrupt the lysogenic form of strain B, implying that the lysogenic phage integrated into the genome rather than disrupting the phage particles themselves. Alternatively, if the lysogenic phage could lyse the phage particles, it would replicate better, but in this case, it's not happening because strain B isn't affected. \n\nSo, in terms of recombination, if the lysogenic phage caused recombination, the offspring phage would have a combination of the two mutations. Now, in the experiment, the number of plasmids (or phage copies) that survive is proportional to the probability of recombination. The formula for the expected number of recombinants is 4Nc, where Nc is the number of recombinant plasmids. But in this case, it's about the number of plasmids per colony.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach. Since only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage does not interfere with strain B's lysogenic form. Therefore, any recombination would lead to the lysogenizing phage integrating into strain B's genome, causing the lysogen to replicate and potentially lyse the phage particles. But in our case, strain B wasn't affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage did not lyse the phage particles. Hence, the lysogenic phage must have integrated into the host genome without interfering with the phage particles.\n\nAlternatively, if there were recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a different DNA sequence, possibly leading to double-strand breaks. But if the lysogenic phage can lyse the phage particle, it would integrate into the host genome and become a prophage, allowing it to replicate better. But in our case, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse the phage particles, so it didn't integrate. This suggests that there was no recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, but let's get back to the numbers. The experiment had two plating dilutions: one at 1:10^7 and another at 1:10^5. Strain B colonies are found in the 1:10^7 half, while strain K finds fewer pluses (only 4 out of 40). The initial plating had all the bacteria alive, so the higher dilution (1:10^7) would give more colonies, as fewer bacteria are present. The lower dilution (1:10^5) would give fewer colonies. \n\nIf there's no recombination, the number of plasmids per colony would be determined by the probability of recombination. However, if there's recombination, some plasmids would be lost due to recombination events. Without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky, but the key point is that the presence of plasmids per colony depends on the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven that only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't disrupt strain B's lysogenic form. Therefore, the presence of recombination would imply that the lysogenic phage integrated into the host genome, disrupting the lysogenic form.

Now, in the experiment, the number of plasmids (or phage copies) that survive is proportional to the probability of recombination. The formula for the expected number of recombinants is 4Nc, where Nc is the number of recombinant plasmids. But in this case, it's about the number of plasmids per colony.\n\nWait, perhaps a simpler approach. Since only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage does not interfere with strain B's lysogenic form. Therefore, any recombination would lead to the lysogenizing phage integrating into strain B's genome, causing the lysogen to replicate and potentially lyse the phage particles. But in our case, strain B wasn't affected, meaning that the lysogenic phage did not lyse the phage particles. Hence, the lysogenic phage must have integrated into the host genome without interfering with the phage particles.\n\nAlternatively, if there were recombination, the lysogenic phage would have a different DNA sequence, possibly leading to double-strand breaks. But if the lysogenic phage can lyse the phage particle, it would integrate into the host genome and become a prophage, allowing it to replicate better. But in our case, the lysogenic phage didn't lyse the phage particles, so it didn't integrate. This suggests that there was no recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome.\n\nWait, but let's get back to the numbers. The experiment had two plating dilutions: one at 1:10^7 and another at 1:10^5. Strain B colonies are found in the 1:10^7 half, while strain K finds fewer pluses (only 4 out of 40). The initial plating had all the bacteria alive, so the higher dilution (1:10^7) would give more colonies, as fewer bacteria are present. The lower dilution (1:10^5) would give fewer colonies. \n\nIf there's no recombination, the number of plasmids per colony would be determined by the probability of recombination. However, if there's recombination, some plasmids would be lost due to recombination events. Without knowing the exact numbers, it's tricky, but the key point is that the presence of plasmids per colony depends on the likelihood of recombination.\n\nGiven that only strain B is affected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't disrupt strain B's lysogenic form. Therefore, the presence of recombination would imply that the lysogenic phage integrated into the host genome, disrupting the lysogenic form. Since strain B wasn't affected, there's no recombination.\n\nThus, the recombination frequency is zero. Looking at the options, D is 0.1 percent and E is 0.02 percent. Zero isn't listed, so the closest would be E, 0.02 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Then they dilute those halves and plate them on strain K. Half of these are diluted more (1:10^7), and half are less diluted (1:10^5). On the K plates, they get four plumes (bubbles) and on B plates, 40 plumes. Wait, actually, the problem says four on K and 40 on B? Hmm, let me check again.\n\nWait, the user wrote: \"Four plaques are found on K and 40 are found on B.\" So if the original sample was from strain B, then after dilution, some have been transferred to strain K. Maybe it's about the effect on each population.\n\nThe experiment is about recombination, so we're looking for how often the two mutations occur together within the same phage. If both mutations are present in the same phage, that's recombination. If they are on different phages, that would be independent assortment, but since there are only two types here, probably recombination makes sense.\n\nThe formula for recombinant frequency is related to the number of offspring where the two mutations are linked. Recombination frequency (rf) is calculated as:\n\nrf = (number of recombinant progeny) / total number of viable offspring)\n\nBut in this case, it might be slightly different because we're dealing with selection coefficients or something else. Alternatively, since the lysogenic phage doesn't affect strain B but affects K, the presence of two mutations in the same phage would mean that phage is lysogenic for both strains. But wait, the phage can only carry either mutation or none in each strain. \n\nWait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the expected outcomes. Normally, without any recombination, all offspring should have the wild-type phenotype. With recombination, some will show the combined effect. Here, strain B has the lysogenic effect, and strain K doesn't. So, if a phage carries both mutations, it would cause issues in both strains. But in reality, most phages carry only one mutation unless they've undergone recombination.\n\nLooking at the results: After transferring the affected B colony to K, some of them show issues. The number of plumes (offspring) depends on whether the phage is functional in both strains. If the phage is lysogenic in both, it would die in both, but perhaps not. Wait, actually, the lysogenic phage doesn't lyse cells; it just integrates into the genome. So, if a phage is lysogenic for both B and K, it shouldn't die because it's integrating into their genomes. However, if it's recombined, it could cause issues in both.\n\nIn the initial experiment, half of the colonies die because the lysogenic phage isn't functional in B. When they're moved to K, some of these (which were originally from B) now have the lysogenic effect in both. Those would die, while others might still function in K but not in B. Similarly, the non-lysed samples remain functional in both.\n\nLet me try to model this. Without recombination, the probability that a phage is lysogenic in both strains would be low. But with recombination, it's higher. The observed data shows that on K, four plumes (but wait, the user said four on K and 40 on B, but I'm confused about what exactly counts as successful replication or death).\n\nAlternatively, considering the numbers: After dilution, 40% of B colonies are dead, meaning that 60% survive. For K, 4% are dead, meaning 96% survive. But why would some of the B colonies die on K? Because they had already lost some plasmids due to selection against B. But if a phage is lysogenic in both, it wouldn't die on either, so why did the K colonies die?\n\nAh, perhaps the dilution process removes some plasmid density. If you dilute too much, the phage may lose its ability to integrate, leading to lethality. So, when transferring the B colonies to K, those with enough plasmids survived, but some didn't. So, the number of surviving plasmids determines the outcome.\n\nWait, the exact numbers are a bit tricky. Let's see: Original sample was 50% B (dead) and 50% K (alive). Then, 50% of B were transferred to K. After dilution, half of these (25%) remained, and half (25%) were further diluted. They were plated on K, and four plumes appeared. On B, 40 plumes appeared.\n\nIf the lysogenic phage is non-recombinant, it would replicate in both strains, so both K and B would have plumes. But if it's recomb, it might replicate only in one.\n\nGiven the results, on K, four plumes appeared. That suggests that the phage was functional in K but not in B. On B, 40 plumes, which is higher than expected if it were non-recombinant. That seems odd because if the phage is non-recombinant, both strains should replicate equally.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the numbers. Let me clarify: The starting point is a plate of strain B. Half of them die, so the remaining half don't. These half are then dilated 1:10^7 and plated on strain K. Of these, four plates showed plumes, meaning four plasmids integrated successfully. Similarly, the other half (non-diluted) are plated on strain K, showing 40 plumes.\n\nThis suggests that the majority of the B colonies died on both, but when moved to K, some of them (the ones that survived on B) started replicating successfully on K. So, the chance that a phage is recomb and thus replicated successfully in both is related to the number of plumes observed.\n\nAssuming that the recombination frequency corresponds to the proportion of phages that have both mutations. In such cases, the expected number of plumes would depend on the success rate of the phage in both strains.\n\nIf recombination occurs at a frequency of r, then the chance that a phage has both mutations is r. Otherwise, it has none, or only one.\n\nIn the experiment, the number of plumes on K is 4, and on B is 40. Assuming that a plume indicates successful replication, the ratio would give us an idea of the likelihood of recombination.\n\nThe formula for the expected number of successful plasmids (if recombination happens) would be proportional to r. Since on K, only 4 plumes arose, compared to 40 on B, the ratio is 1:10. This suggests that the success rate in K is 1/10th of B, implying a recombination frequency of 0.1%.\n\nWait, but if the recombination frequency is 0.1%, then the chance that a phage is recomb would be 0.1%. Therefore, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to this frequency. So, if the base rate is, say, 1 per 100 plasmids, a 0.1% frequency would lead to 0.001 plasmids per phage, which doesn't directly translate to the number of plumes observed.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes reflects the number of successful fusions, the recombination frequency would determine the probability of fusion in both strains. Thus, a lower recombination frequency would lead to fewer plumes in both strains.\n\nGiven that on K, only 4 plumes were observed, whereas on B, 40 were seen, the ratio suggests that the probability of recombination is 0.1%. Therefore, the answer is D. 0.05% or J. 0.05%? Wait, 4 vs 40 is a factor of 10. If the recombination frequency is 0.1%, then the number of plumes would be consistent across both strains.\n\nAlternatively, the calculation might involve the product of the probabilities of recombination in each strain, assuming independence. But since the phage can only carry one mutation, recombination implies that both strains have the mutation, making it impossible to have independent assortment.\n\nThus, the correct approach is to calculate the recombination frequency based on the observed number of plumes. Given the numbers, the recombination frequency is approximately 0.1%, which corresponds to option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

One is dilute (half the population) and placed on strain B, yielding 40 plumes. The other is more concentrated (diluted 1:10^5) and placed on strain K, resulting in 4 plumes. \n\nFrom what I remember, when a mutation confers a functional trait like lysogeny, the number of colonies depends on how many cells can take up the phage without being killed. If there's complete recombination, each phage can integrate the mutation into the host genome, allowing them to replicate and lyse the bacteria. Without recombination, each phage has an independent chance of causing issues.\n\nIn the first scenario, the lysogenic phage from strain B is present, but strain K doesn't have it. So, if strain K's phage had some recombination, it could cause some issues. However, since only 4 plumes were found on K, which is lower than expected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't really integrate effectively. Maybe the phage was neutral.\n\nIn the second case, when the concentration is high, the higher number of plumes (40) compared to the low concentration (4) indicates that the phages in the higher concentration are more likely to express the lysogenic property. This points towards a high degree of recombination where the lysogenic phage integrated the mutation into the host genome, making them more effective at lysing the bacteria.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, I think about the concept of \"degree of recombination.\" If the phages were completely recombined, all would show the lysogenic phenotype, leading to maximum expression. Conversely, if there was no recombination, each phage would behave independently. Since only a small fraction (4 out of 40) showed the lysogenic effect, that implies significant integration.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, which is approximately 1 - (number of non-recombinant/total), but here we're dealing with plumes. Alternatively, considering the ratio of observed vs expected, perhaps using the chi-squared test, but maybe a simpler approach suffices. Given that 4 out of 40 shows the lysogenic effect, that's a 10% success rate. Assuming that full recombination would lead to 100%, then 90% success rate implies 10% recombination. Wait, but I'm not sure if that's accurate.\n\nWait, another approach: The number of plumes indicates the likelihood of the phage expressing the lysogenic property. If the phage integrates the mutation, it would lyse the bacteria. In the first case, only 4 out of 40 plumes are lysed, which is 10%. That suggests that the lysogenic phage integrated the mutation into the host genome a certain percentage of the time. Similarly, in the second case, 40 plumes on strain B, which is much higher than the expectation if the phage wasn't recombining\u2014maybe it's possible that the phage did recombine, but given the low number, perhaps it's minimal.\n\nBut wait, the key point is the ratio of successful plumes to total. Strain B had 40 plumes, with 4 showing the lysogenic effect. On strain K, 4 plumes. So the ratio for strain B is 10%, and for strain K, it's 1%. So the difference in these ratios suggests the level of recombination. If recombination occurs, the lysogenic phages would integrate the mutation, increasing their ability to lyse. But in the first case, only 10% of phages caused lysing, while in the second case, only 1%.\n\nThis suggests that the recombination occurred enough times in the first culture to allow only 10% of phages to lyse, whereas in the second culture, even less recombination allowed only 1% to lyse. This discrepancy indicates that the recombination was occurring but not fully consistent across the cultures. But looking back at the question, it asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations, implying a specific percentage rather than whether it happened or not.\n\nPerhaps the correct approach is to consider that in the first culture (low concentration), if there was no recombination, you'd expect more plumes (since more phages would have the mutation). Here, only 4 out of 40, which is 10%. Whereas in the second culture, if there was full recombination, you'd expect more plumes (say, 40 out of 40), but instead you got only 4. Hmm, that seems contradictory.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the presence of both mutations allows for some interaction, reducing the required concentration needed for full expression. Perhaps the recombination reduces the effectiveness, hence requiring fewer plasmids to see full expression. But I'm getting confused here.\n\nLet me try to think differently. The number of plumes indicates the relative probability of the mutation expressing itself. For strain B, 4 out of 40 plumes suggest a 10% chance. For strain K, 4 out of 40 also suggests a 10% chance? But wait, strain K wasn't affected at all except when plated on B. No, wait, strain K wasn't used in the first culture; the first culture was on B, and the second on K.\n\nSo in the first culture, on B, 4 out of 40 plumes indicated lysogenic expression. On K, on a high concentration, 4 out of 40 plumes (or is it 40?), actually, the problem states: \"the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\" Wait, no, the description says:\n\n\"Half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nWait, let me check again. The user wrote:\n\n\"Another half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on a lawn of E. coli strain B. The other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K.\"\n\nSo, in the first case, on strain B, 40 plumes, and on strain K, 4 plumes. Now, for strain B, 4 out of 40 plumes indicate lysogenic expression, which is a 10% success rate. For strain K, 4 out of 40 plumes as well, same 10% success rate. But wait, why is K having the same ratio?\n\nMaybe because the phage didn't integrate into K's genome, so the failure is due to other factors. But the question is about the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. So the recombination refers to whether the lysogenic phage integrated into the host DNA, making it capable of lysing.\n\nIf recombination occurred, then the lysogenic phage would have integrated into the host, making them more effective. So, in the first culture (on B), if there was recombination, the lysogenic phage would have integrated, so it should lyse more easily, leading to more plumes. Instead, only 10% of them did so, suggesting that recombination didn't happen as much as expected.\n\nSimilarly, on K, the phage didn't integrate, so the lysogenic phage shouldn't have been able to lyse. But in reality, 4 plumes were seen, which is similar to the 10% on B, indicating that K's phage didn't integrate.\n\nBut the question is asking for the amount of recombination between the two mutations. So, if recombination happened, the lysogenic phage would integrate, and thus the number of plumes would increase. But in our data, the number of plumes is lower than expected, indicating incomplete recombination.\n\nHowever, the options provided are percentages, so I need to determine the proportion of recombinants versus wild type.\n\nLooking at the numbers: On strain B, 4 out of 40 plumes (10%) indicate lysogenic expression. On strain K, 4 out of 40 (10%). So, the same success rate on both strains, which makes sense if no recombination occurred. But since the question is about recombination between the two mutations, perhaps the recombination is measured as the percentage of plasmid copies that are functional.\n\nWait, another thought: The presence of a functional mutation in the phage (lysogenic) in the host DNA would make the phage lyse the bacteria. If the phage doesn't recombine, it behaves randomly. If it does recombine, it integrates and becomes more effective.\n\nGiven that on strain B, 10% of the phages lyse, and on strain K, also 10%, it suggests that recombination hasn't occurred enough to cause a significant change in the expression rates. But the question is about determining the actual recombination between the two mutations.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because both mutations are lysogenic. The lysogenic phage can integrate a mutation into the host genome. If the phage integrates the mutation, it becomes more efficient at lysing. If it doesn't integrate, it works independently.\n\nSo, if the phages recombine, they become more effective, leading to more plumes. If they don't recombine, they behave randomly. Therefore, the number of plumes reflects the degree of recombination.\n\nIn our case, on both strains, only 10% of the phages lyse. If recombination happened, the phages would lyse more. But since the same success rate is observed on both strains, it suggests that recombination didn't occur significantly.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the amount of recombination between the two mutations. Since both mutations are lysogenic, the recombination refers to the integration of one mutation into the host genome by the other mutation.\n\nTherefore, if recombination occurred, the number of functional phages (those that successfully integrated the mutation) would increase, leading to more plumes. However, in our case, the number of plumes is the same on both strains, suggesting that recombination didn't happen enough to affect the expression rates.\n\nBut the options are about the percentage of recombination. So, perhaps the answer relates to the expected number of recombinant plasmids versus wild-type.\n\nAlternatively, the number of plumes can help estimate the efficiency of integration. If recombination occurred, the efficiency would be higher, leading to more plumes.\n\nGiven that on both strains, the number of plumes is 10% of the total, and assuming that recombination occurred, the efficiency would be higher, say 50% or more. But here, it's only 10%, which suggests partial recombination.\n\nBut I'm getting stuck. Let me think of the standard approach. The number of plumes can be used to estimate the degree of recombination. The formula is often based on the number of successful plating events, adjusted for the expected number under different scenarios.\n\nIn the absence of recombination, the number of successful plating events would be proportional to the number of phages that expressed the mutation. With recombination, the number increases because the phages that integrated the mutation are more likely to lyse.\n\nAssuming that recombination occurred at a rate 'p', the number of successful plating events would be p * N, where N is the total number of phages.\n\nIn the first culture, with low concentration, the number of plumes (S1) is 4, and the total phage count is 40. So S1 = p * N.\n\nIn the second culture, with high concentration, the number of plumes (S2) is 4, but the concentration is higher, so the number of phages per liter is higher, but the number of plumes is still 4.\n\nIf recombination occurred, S1 and S2 would be related by the ratio of concentrations. But since S2 is higher than S1, and the concentration is higher, the ratio would be S2/S1 = C2/C1.\n\nBut if recombination occurred, the ratio should reflect the efficiency. However, in our case, S1 = 0.1 * N and S2 = 0.1 * M, where M > N, but the ratio S2/S1 would still be 0.1 * M / 0.1 * N = M/N, which is greater than 1. But in our case, the actual ratio is 1, which suggests that recombination didn't occur enough to make the ratio larger. Therefore, the recombination rate must be zero.\n\nBut this contradicts the options, which include non-zero recombination rates. Alternatively, perhaps the calculation considers the ratio of plumes on the two plating lots.\n\nWait, another idea: The expected number of plumes on strain B (without recombination) would be proportional to the product of the concentrations and the efficiency. If recombination occurred, the efficiency would increase, leading to more plumes.\n\nBut without knowing the exact calculations, perhaps the best way is to look for the closest match. The options are percentages ranging from 0.02% to 0.5%. Given that in both cases, only 10% of the phages were successful, and assuming that recombination occurred at a rate that resulted in this outcome, the recombination rate would be around 0.05% (option F).\n\nAlternatively, if recombination occurred at 0.05%, the number of plumes would be higher, but here it's lower, which suggests that recombination didn't happen as much as expected. So perhaps the correct answer is E, 0.02%, given that it's closer to 0%.\n\nBut I'm not confident. Another approach: The number of plumes is inversely proportional to the square root of the concentration. So, for the same number of plumes, a higher concentration would require fewer phages. If recombination increased the efficiency, the number of plumes would decrease.\n\nIn our case, on strain B (lower concentration), only 10% of the phages led to lysing, and on strain K (higher concentration), only 10% as well. This suggests that recombination didn't increase the efficiency beyond a point, possibly because the phages didn't recombine sufficiently.\n\nTherefore, the recombination rate must be very low, possibly around 0.02% (option E).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But strain K isn't affected, meaning its phage might be either lysogenic or neutral.\n\nThe experiment involves two plating lots. One is dilute (half the population) and placed on strain B, yielding 40 plumes. The other is more concentrated (diluted 1:10^5) and placed on strain K, resulting in 4 plumes. \n\nFrom what I remember, when a mutation confers a functional trait like lysogeny, the number of colonies depends on how many cells can take up the phage without being killed. If there's complete recombination, each phage can integrate the mutation into the host genome, allowing them to replicate and lyse the bacteria. Without recombination, each phage has an independent chance of causing issues.\n\nIn the first scenario, the lysogenic phage from strain B is present, but strain K doesn't have it. So, if strain K's phage had some recombination, it could cause some issues. However, since only 4 plumes were found on K, which is lower than expected, it suggests that the lysogenic phage didn't really integrate effectively. Maybe the phage was neutral.\n\nIn the second case, when the concentration is high, the higher number of plumes (40) compared to the low concentration (4) indicates that the phages in the higher concentration are more likely to express the lysogenic property. This points towards a high degree of recombination where the lysogenic phage integrated the mutation into the host genome, making them more effective at lysing the bacteria.\n\nTo calculate the percentage, I think about the concept of \"degree of recombination.\" If the phages were completely recombined, all would show the lysogenic phenotype, leading to maximum expression. Conversely, if there was no recombination, each phage would behave independently. Since only a small fraction (4 out of 40) showed the lysogenic effect, that implies significant integration.\n\nUsing the formula for recombination frequency, which is approximately 1 - (number of non-recombinant/total), but here we're dealing with plumes. Alternatively, considering the ratio of observed vs expected, perhaps using the chi-squared test, but maybe a simpler approach suffices. Given that 4 out of 40 shows the lysogenic effect, that's a 10% success rate. Assuming that full recombination would lead to 100%, then 90% success rate implies 10% recombination.

    "rollout": " But when they infect strain K, which has both types, nothing happens. So the lysogenic mutation isn't enough alone to cause problems, but maybe together?\n\nThe experiment involves diluting the phages into bacterial cultures and then plating them on strains B and K. The key point here is that the lysogenic phage caused half the bacteria to die (lysed), meaning it's active. But since it doesn't lyse, it just lives and replicates, causing lysogeny. However, when it's mixed with another type of phage (the one that dies upon replication), it doesn't affect the lysogeny anymore because the phage that dies would kill the cells before they can replicate.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says that only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission (they die after replicating), while the other type doesn't. So if you mix these two types, the lysogenic phage will lyse the cells (cause death), but the other type won't. So when you plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death, leading to half the colonies dying. On strain K, which has both types, neither effect occurs, so all the colonies survive or don't lyse? Wait, but the result was four plaques on K and 40 on B. Hmm, I might be getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. The phages are mixed with E. coli, and some of them lyse the cells (so they're dead) while others do not. Then these phages are plated on the lawn. If a phage kills the E. coli, there's no more growth; if it lyses, the E. coli don't grow as much, creating a mosaic pattern. If a phage doesn't lyse, it doesn't kill the E. coli, so the colonies stay alive, creating a mosaic where some areas have killed phages and others haven't.\n\nIn this case, when plating on strain B, half of the colonies died, suggesting that each colony had either a lysogenic phage that killed it or a lysogenic phage that didn't kill it. Wait, but lysogenic phages usually cause lysogeny, right? Or do they lyse?\n\nWait, the problem says that lysogenic phages cause lytic fission (die after replicating), while the other type doesn't. So when you mix these two types, the lysogenic phages will lyse the E. coli (they die after replicating), causing the colonies to die, while the non-lysed phages won't cause any issues because they don't lyse\u2014wait, but if they don't lyse, why wouldn't they replicate and cause lysogeny? No, wait\u2014if a lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it doesn't cause replication, so the E. coli don't get replicated beyond their existing state. So if you mix both types, the lysogenic phages will lyse the E. coli (causing death), and the non-lysed phages won't, so the colonies will still form a mosaic with some areas having killed phages and others intact. But in this experiment, when you plate on strain B, half the colonies died, indicating that each colony either had a lysogenic phage that killed it or a phage that didn't kill it. So perhaps the lysogenic phage can sometimes lyse and sometimes not, depending on its mutation.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII, which allows it to cause lysis (lytic fission). So when you mix the two types, the lysogenic phage can either lyse (if it's wild-type) or not (if it's mutant). Similarly, the non-lysed phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't affect the lysogeny because it doesn't replicate.\n\nSo when you plate on strain B, half the colonies have been affected by the lysogenic phage (either killing or not), and the other half have not. But wait, the result was that half of the plates died, implying that each colony had either a lysogenic phage that killed it or one that didn't. So for each colony, either it was killed or it wasn't, regardless of whether the lysogenic phage was wild-type or mutant.\n\nNow, when you plate on strain K, which has both types, neither effect occurs, so all colonies remain. This suggests that the combination of both types doesn't cause any issue, implying that the lysogenic phage must carry a mutation that prevents it from causing lysis even when combined with the non-lysed phage.\n\nThis situation resembles a scenario where the two mutations are recombining in such a way that the lysogenic phage cannot induce lysis when mixed with the non-lysed phage. In genetic terms, this is similar to a double recessive lethal combination. For a double recessive lethal combination, the probability of lethality is equal to the product of the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nGiven that the colonies are halved and then plated twice, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability of lethality = (frequency of first mutation) * (frequency of second mutation)\n\nWe know that four plates died on K, which has both types.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 phage region based on the experimental results described. Let me start by understanding the setup. There are two types of mutantphages: one causes lytic fission (dies after replicating) and the other causes lysogenic fission (lives longer). When they infect E. coli strain B, only the lysogenic phage does something bad because it doesn't lyse the cell. But when they infect strain K, which has both types, nothing happens. So the lysogenic mutation isn't enough alone to cause problems, but maybe together?\n\nThe experiment involves diluting the phages into bacterial cultures and then plating them on strains B and K. The key point here is that the lysogenic phage caused half the bacteria to die (lysed), meaning it's active. But since it doesn't lyse, it just lives and replicates, causing lysogeny. However, when it's mixed with another type of phage (the one that dies upon replication), it doesn't affect the lysogeny anymore because the phage that dies would kill the cells before they can replicate.\n\nWait, no\u2014the problem says that only lysogenic phages cause lytic fission (they die after replicating), while the other type doesn't. So if you mix these two types, the lysogenic phage will lyse the cells (cause death), but the other type won't. So when you plate on strain B, only the lysogenic phages cause death, leading to half the colonies dying. On strain K, which has both types, neither effect occurs, so all the colonies survive or don't lyse? Wait, but the result was four plaques on K and 40 on B. Hmm, I might be getting confused.\n\nLet me think again. The phages are mixed with E. coli, and some of them lyse the cells (so they're dead) while others do not. Then these phages are plated on the lawn. If a phage kills the E. coli, there's no more growth; if it lyses, the E. coli don't grow as much, creating a mosaic pattern. If a phage doesn't lyse, it doesn't kill the E. coli, so the colonies stay alive, creating a mosaic where some areas have killed phages and others haven't.\n\nIn this case, when plating on strain B, half of the colonies died, suggesting that each colony had either a lysogenic phage that killed it or a lysogenic phage that didn't kill it. Wait, but lysogenic phages usually cause lysogeny, right? Or do they lyse?\n\nWait, the problem says that lysogenic phages cause lytic fission (die after replicating), while the other type doesn't. So when you mix these two types, the lysogenic phages will lyse the E. coli (they die after replicating), causing the colonies to die, while the non-lysed phages won't cause any issues because they don't lyse\u2014wait, but if they don't lyse, why wouldn't they replicate and cause lysogeny? No, wait\u2014if a lysogenic phage doesn't lyse, it doesn't cause replication, so the E. coli don't get replicated beyond their existing state. So if you mix both types, the lysogenic phages will lyse the E. coli (causing death), and the non-lysed phages won't, so the colonies will still form a mosaic with some areas having killed phages and others intact. But in this experiment, when you plate on strain B, half the colonies died, indicating that each colony either had a lysogenic phage that killed it or a phage that didn't kill it. So perhaps the lysogenic phage can sometimes lyse and sometimes not, depending on its mutation.\n\nBut wait, the question mentions that the lysogenic phage carries a mutation in rII, which allows it to cause lysis (lytic fission). So when you mix the two types, the lysogenic phage can either lyse (if it's wild-type) or not (if it's mutant). Similarly, the non-lysed phage (which doesn't lyse) doesn't affect the lysogeny because it doesn't replicate.\n\nSo when you plate on strain B, half the colonies have been affected by the lysogenic phage (either killing or not), and the other half have not. But wait, the result was that half of the plates died, implying that each colony had either a lysogenic phage that killed it or one that didn't. So for each colony, either it was killed or it wasn't, regardless of whether the lysogenic phage was wild-type or mutant.\n\nNow, when you plate on strain K, which has both types, neither effect occurs, so all colonies remain. This suggests that the combination of both types doesn't cause any issue, implying that the lysogenic phage must carry a mutation that prevents it from causing lysis even when combined with the non-lysed phage.\n\nThis situation resembles a scenario where the two mutations are recombining in such a way that the lysogenic phage cannot induce lysis when mixed with the non-lysed phage. In genetic terms, this is similar to a double recessive lethal combination. For a double recessive lethal combination, the probability of lethality is equal to the product of the frequencies of each mutation.\n\nGiven that the colonies are halved and then plated twice, we can use the formula:\n\nProbability of lethality = (frequency of first mutation) * (frequency of second mutation)\n\nWe know that four plates died on K, which has both types. Since the total number of colonies after dilution is 1:10^7 and then 1:10^5, the overall dilution factor is 10^(7+5)=10^12. The probability of lethality is 4 / (10^12) \u2248 4e-12.\n\nAssuming each mutation contributes equally, let\u2019s denote the frequency of each mutation as p. Since the two mutations are independent and presumably additive, the probability of lethality due to both mutations is p^2.\n\nSetting p^2 = 4e-12 \u2192 p = sqrt(4e-12) = 2e-6.\n\nConverting this to percentage: 2e-6 * 100% = 0.0002%, which is approximately 0.0002%.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nE. 0.02 percent\nF. 0.3 percent\nG. 0.5 percent\nH. 5 percent\nI. 0.02 percent\nJ. 0.05 percent\nK. 0.0002 percent\n\nThe closest option is H (5%) and I (0.02%).

One half is diluted 1:10^7 and plated on strain B's lawn, while the other half is diluted 1:10^5 and plated on strain K's lawn. After incubation, four plumes appear on strain K's lawn and 40 on strain B's. \n\nHmm, what do these numbers mean? Dilution affects the probability of the mutation being passed or observed. A higher dilution means fewer chances for the mutation to be expressed because each plasmid has a lower chance of replication. So if we have a higher dilution factor, like 1:10^7, the expected number of plumes would be lower if both mutations occurred independently.\n\nWait, but here strain K shows more plumes than expected from independent events. That suggests some form of association or interaction between the mutations. Maybe they're linked or cause some form of interference where one mutation increases the likelihood of another.\n\nIn genetic terms, when two mutations occur in the same gene locus, their recombination frequency tells us how often they occur in the population. Recombination frequency is typically measured in percentage points, ranging from 0% (no recombination) up to 100%. Since the options go up to 5%, which is quite high, but given the experimental data, perhaps the recombination is low.\n\nLooking at the experiment: If the two mutations were independent, the expected number of plumes would be proportional to the product of their frequencies. However, since one strain doesn't show any division, maybe one mutation is recessive and the other dominant. Or perhaps one mutation confers a resistance that enhances the expression of the other.\n\nBut let's think about the results. On strain B's lawn, four plumes appeared, which might suggest a low frequency of the mutation. On strain K, 40 plumes. The difference could indicate that the mutations are interacting somehow.\n\nAnother approach: The dilution factors relate to the probability of the mutation being present. For example, a 1:10^7 dilution would mean that each plasmid has a 1/10^7 chance of being present in the plasmid. Similarly, 1:10^5 is 1/10^5. If the mutations are independent, the combined probability would be (1/10^7)*(1/10^5) = 1/10^12, which seems too low to produce even one plume. But since four plumes appeared on strain B, perhaps there's a different mechanism.\n\nAlternatively, if one mutation suppresses the other, then the presence of one mutation would increase the likelihood of the other being expressed. This would lead to some sort of synergy or antagonism. In this case, the lysogenic phage might cause the lysogenic fission of the lysogenic phage itself, leading to increased activity. So when you plate on strain B, which is supposed to handle lysogenic phages well, but if the lysogenic phage also causes its own lysogeny, it might interfere with the normal process.\n\nSo if the two mutations are linked, meaning they occur close together on the chromosome, their proximity might influence whether they interfere or enhance each other's activity. Linkage reduces recombination frequency because alleles from close genes tend to be inherited together. Recombination frequency measures the proportion of offspring showing opposite alleles. If they're linked, recombination isn't possible, so all offspring show the same allele.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the mutations may not directly affect each other's expression unless they're in the same gene. Since the problem mentions recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which refers to nearby genes, the recombinant frequency would be low because most loci are tightly linked.\n\nLet me look back at the data. Strain B had four plumes, and strain K had 40. The ratio is roughly 1:10, suggesting a significant interaction between the mutations. If the mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes should be similar across both strains if they're independent. But here, strain K has many more plumes, which suggests a stronger association.\n\nIf the mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes on both strains might be similar because the linkage reduces recombination. However, the observed number is much higher on strain K, indicating an additional factor beyond simple linkage.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are independent but one is recessive, it might mask the effect of the other. But in this case, both mutations are affecting the lysogenic fission, so perhaps they don't work independently.\n\nAnother possibility is that one mutation confers a resistance that allows the other mutation to be expressed more effectively. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a resistance gene that confers a fitness advantage, then when it replicates, it might allow the lysogenic phage to replicate better, increasing the likelihood of lysogenic activity.\n\nThis kind of positive interference can lead to increased expression of one mutation over the other. So the presence of one mutation makes the other more likely to be expressed, resulting in more plumes on one strain than the other.\n\nGiven the results, four plumes on strain B and 40 on strain K, the ratio is about 1:10. This suggests that the interaction is strong enough to explain the difference. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect the same number of plumes on both strains, but here strain K has ten times as many, implying a significant interaction.\n\nNow, thinking about recombination frequency: If the mutations are linked, the recombination frequency is very low. But the options include small percentages like 0.05%, which corresponds to 0.0005 probability per crossing-over event. Recombination frequency is usually measured as the percentage of cases where crossover occurs, so a 0.05% would mean that only a tiny fraction of the population has the linked forms.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If the mutations are linked, the recombination frequency would be low. However, in this case, the experiments didn't support complete independence; instead, there was a significant interaction, possibly due to some form of interference.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are not linked, the recombination frequency would be zero, but the observed data suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, actually, if the mutations are in separate regions of the T_4 genome, their recombination frequency would be determined by their physical distance apart. The closer they are, the less recombination is likely. But the options provided are small percentages, which correspond to high recombination frequencies.\n\nBut given the experimental evidence of an interaction leading to a higher number of plumes on strain K, perhaps the mutations are close and exhibit some form of interference or enhancement rather than independent assortment.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities. Assuming that each mutation has a certain frequency, say p and q, and that they are linked with a recombination frequency r. Then, the probability of independent assortment is (1 - r), whereas the probability of linked assortment is r.\n\nBut without specific frequencies, it's hard to calculate. Alternatively, considering the experimental outcomes, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.05%, which is option F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Wait, 0.05% is option F, but the closest option is D (0.02%) or E (0.05%).\n\nBut in my earlier analysis, the ratio of plumes suggests a moderate interaction, not perfect independence. If the expected number under independent assumptions were similar, but here it's significantly different, perhaps the recombination frequency is low but non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on strain K is ten times higher, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that only a small fraction of the potential combinations are occurring, leading to a higher count on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the answer choices suggest a relatively small percentage, likely around 0.05% or 0.02%.\n\nGiven that the difference between the plume counts is a factor of 10, and assuming that the recombination frequency is minimal, the correct answer might be D (0.02%) or E (0.05%), depending on the precise calculation.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: The number of plumes indicates the likelihood of the mutation being expressed. If the lysogenic phage is active, it will cause division. On strain B, which handles lysogenic phages well, only lysogenic phage activity matters. On strain K, which doesn't handle lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage must cause division itself. So the difference in plume counts reflects the ability of the lysogenic phage to divide.\n\nThus, the fact that strain K has ten times more plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective at causing division in strain K compared to strain B. This could imply that the mutation causing the lysogenic phage to divide itself is linked or near a region of high recombination, enhancing its activity.\n\nBut again, without precise calculations, it's tricky. Given the options, I'll choose E (0.05%) as it's slightly above the 0.02% in option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Linkage reduces recombination frequency because alleles from close genes tend to be inherited together. Recombination frequency measures the proportion of offspring showing opposite alleles. If they're linked, recombination isn't possible, so all offspring show the same allele.\n\nBut wait, in this case, the mutations may not directly affect each other's expression unless they're in the same gene. Since the problem mentions recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome, which refers to nearby genes, the recombinant frequency would be low because most loci are tightly linked.\n\nLet me look back at the data. Strain B had four plumes, and strain K had 40. The ratio is roughly 1:10, suggesting a significant interaction between the mutations. If the mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes should be similar across both strains if they're independent. But here, strain K has many more plumes, which suggests a stronger association.\n\nIf the mutations are linked, the expected number of plumes on both strains might be similar because the linkage reduces recombination. However, the observed number is much higher on strain K, indicating an additional factor beyond simple linkage.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are independent but one is recessive, it might mask the effect of the other. But in this case, both mutations are affecting the lysogenic fission, so perhaps they don't work independently.\n\nAnother possibility is that one mutation confers a resistance that allows the other mutation to be expressed more effectively. For example, if the lysogenic phage has a resistance gene that confers a fitness advantage, then when it replicates, it might allow the lysogenic phage to replicate better, increasing the likelihood of lysogenic activity.\n\nThis kind of positive interference can lead to increased expression of one mutation over the other. So the presence of one mutation makes the other more likely to be expressed, resulting in more plumes on one strain than the other.\n\nGiven the results, four plumes on strain B and 40 on strain K, the ratio is about 1:10. This suggests that the interaction is strong enough to explain the difference. If the mutations were independent, we'd expect the same number of plumes on both strains, but here strain K has ten times as many, implying a significant interaction.\n\nNow, thinking about recombination frequency: If the mutations are linked, the recombination frequency is very low. But the options include small percentages like 0.05%, which corresponds to 0.0005 probability per crossing-over event. Recombination frequency is usually measured as the percentage of cases where crossover occurs, so a 0.05% would mean that only a tiny fraction of the population has the linked forms.\n\nBut the question asks for the amount of recombination between the two mutations in the T_4 genome. If the mutations are linked, the recombination frequency would be low. However, in this case, the experiments didn't support complete independence; instead, there was a significant interaction, possibly due to some form of interference.\n\nAlternatively, if the mutations are not linked, the recombination frequency would be zero, but the observed data suggest otherwise.\n\nWait, actually, if the mutations are in separate regions of the T_4 genome, their recombination frequency would be determined by their physical distance apart. The closer they are, the less recombination is likely. But the options provided are small percentages, which correspond to high recombination frequencies.\n\nBut given the experimental evidence of an interaction leading to a higher number of plumes on strain K, perhaps the mutations are close and exhibit some form of interference or enhancement rather than independent assortment.\n\nHowever, the exact calculation requires knowing the probabilities. Assuming that each mutation has a certain frequency, say p and q, and that they are linked with a recombination frequency r. Then, the probability of independent assortment is (1 - r), whereas the probability of linked assortment is r.\n\nBut without specific frequencies, it's hard to calculate. Alternatively, considering the experimental outcomes, perhaps the recombination frequency is around 0.05%, which is option F (0.3%) or G (0.5%). Wait, 0.05% is option F, but the closest option is D (0.02%) or E (0.05%).\n\nBut in my earlier analysis, the ratio of plumes suggests a moderate interaction, not perfect independence. If the expected number under independent assumptions were similar, but here it's significantly different, perhaps the recombination frequency is low but non-zero.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the number of plumes on strain K is ten times higher, perhaps the recombination frequency is such that only a small fraction of the potential combinations are occurring, leading to a higher count on strain K.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key is that the answer choices suggest a relatively small percentage, likely around 0.05% or 0.02%.\n\nGiven that the difference between the plume counts is a factor of 10, and assuming that the recombination frequency is minimal, the correct answer might be D (0.02%) or E (0.05%), depending on the precise calculation.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another angle: The number of plumes indicates the likelihood of the mutation being expressed. If the lysogenic phage is active, it will cause division. On strain B, which handles lysogenic phages well, only lysogenic phage activity matters. On strain K, which doesn't handle lysogenic phages, the lysogenic phage must cause division itself. So the difference in plume counts reflects the ability of the lysogenic phage to divide.\n\nThus, the fact that strain K has ten times more plumes suggests that the lysogenic phage is more effective at causing division in strain K compared to strain B. This could imply that the mutation causing the lysogenic phage to divide itself is linked or near a region of high recombination, enhancing its activity.\n\nBut again, without precise calculations, it's tricky. Given the options, I'll choose E (0.05%) as it's slightly above the 0.02% in option J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

After incubation, there were 4 plumes on strain K and 40 on B. \n\nI remember that recombination refers to the exchange of genetic material during replication. If the two mutations are recombinant, their effect might be additive or multiplicative depending on how they interact. Since the lysogenic phage isn't affecting strain B but is causing problems with strain K, maybe they're linked.\n\nThe formula for calculating the likelihood of recombination is (number of observed recombinants)/(total number expected), which should be around 50%. So if we have 4 on K and 40 on B, that's 4 + 40 = 44. Total expected is 84 (since each group is halved and then plated). So 4/84 \u2248 4.76%, close to 5%.\n\nBut wait, another approach is to calculate the chance of recombination using the ratio of plumes. The expectation is that if they're independent, you'd see some recombinants. Here, since only one mutation affects B and none on K, it suggests they don't interfere much. But the exact calculation probably uses the formula (n1 * n2)/ (n1 + n2) * 100. Plugging in n1=40 and n2=4 gives (40*4)/(44)*100\u224836.36%. Hmm, that's about 36%, which is close to option G (0.5%) but seems too high. Maybe I'm mixing up the numbers.\n\nWait, no, actually, the correct way is to consider the number of times the two mutations occurred together versus separately. In this case, all the plumes on B came from either the lysogenic phage being present or from recombination. Similarly, the plumes on K showed only the lysogenic phage. So the number of recombinant plumes would be zero here, but in reality, perhaps some did show some, leading to the difference.\n\nAlternatively, considering the frequency of recombination, the probability is calculated as (number of recombinants)/(expected recombinants + expected non-recombinants). Expected recombinants would be the total from recombination events, which I think is n1*n2/(n1+n2). Wait, no, let me look up the formula again.\n\nActually, the formula is: Recombination rate = (Observed recombinants)/(Expected recombinants + Expected non-combinants).\n\nIn this case, Observed recombinants on K is 4, and on B is 40. Expected recombinants would depend on the number of cases where both mutations could occur independently. Since only K shows no effect, and B shows an effect, it suggests that the two mutations are linked, meaning some recombination occurs.\n\nSo, expected recombinants = (number of plumes on B without recombination) + (number on K without recombination). But without more data, it's tricky. Alternatively, the likelihood of recombination is proportional to the number of plumes observed.\n\nGiven that there are 4 on K and 40 on B, the ratio is 4:40, which simplifies to 1:10. This suggests a low recombination rate. To convert this to percentage, 1/11 \u22489.09%, but since we're looking at the proportion of recombining plumes compared to total, it's 1/(1+10)=1/11\u22489%, which is about 0.09, closer to 0.1% (option J) or 0.05% (option I).

That implies that the two mutations are linked, and recombination has occurred. The number of plumes on K (4) and B (40) suggests that recombination happened less frequently than expected.\n\nSince the total number of plumes is 44, the recombination rate is 4/44 \u22489.09%, but this is not directly given. Alternatively, considering the formula for likelihood of recombination, which is (observed recombination)/(expected recombination + expected non-recombination). If recombination happens at a rate of r, then expected recombinants would be r*(n1*n2)/(n1+n2). Without knowing n1 and n2, it's hard to apply.\n\nMaybe the better approach is to realize that the observed recombinant plumes are fewer than expected, indicating low recombination. Given that only 4 out of 44 seem to show recombination, the recombination rate is approximately 9%, which is about 0.09, closer to 0.1% (option J) or 0.05% (option I). But none of these options match exactly.
