  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how to answer this question about proving that a new species of bioluminescent worm is actually its own species and not some contaminating bacteria. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the question asks what method would best show that the worm isn't just a contaminant but belongs to its own genus or species. The options are A through J, each suggesting different methods.\n\nLet me go through them one by one:\n\nA. Isolate the light-producing organ and test it in isolation. This seems like a good idea because if the worm produces light, testing it alone might show unique properties. But wait, maybe other things can produce light too, so it's not conclusive.\n\nB. Use spectroscopy to analyze the light's wavelength signature. Spectroscopy can identify specific wavelengths, which might match known bioluminescent organisms better than isolated tests. That sounds promising.\n\nC. Place the substance in growth media or look under a microscope. This could show physical presence and maybe growth rates, indicating it's a real organism rather than something else.\n\nD. Treat with antibiotics to stop light production. If the worm stops emitting light when antibiotic is present, it suggests it has those genes. But this might be tricky and not definitive.\n\nE. Knock out suspected genes to see if light stops. Similar to D, but more direct. If the gene product is essential, treating the worm would show that.\n\nF. Do DNA sequencing. Sequencing can reveal genetic makeup, showing if there are unique mutations or traits.\n\nG. Look for bioluminescent proteins. If the worm has proteins that others don't, it's likely its own species.\n\nH. Compare with bacterial patterns. If the worm's pattern matches known ones, it's probably theirs.\n\nI. Observe in dark environment. Light doesn't work well in darkness, so seeing changes might indicate issues with the worm's physiology.\n\nJ. Measure light intensity over time. Tracking how light levels change could show the worm's role in its life cycle.\n\nNow, considering all these, the most convincing would involve both comparing with known organisms (like H) and looking at physical presence (C). Maybe combining B and F? Or E and G?\n\nBut since the user wants a single-letter answer, perhaps H is the key because it directly compares the worm's bioluminescence with known patterns. Alternatively, C shows physical presence, making it clear it's an organism rather than a bacterium.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
