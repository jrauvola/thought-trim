Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about students tasting phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), which is an example of incomplete dominance. Let me try to figure this out step by step.\n\nFirst, the basics: PTC is an example where the phenotype isn't simple like dominant or recessive; it's more like two different traits being expressed together because the alleles interact in a specific way. In this case, the presence of a 'T' allele makes you a taster, and a 't' allele means you aren't a taster. So, the possible genotypes are TT (both alleles are 'T'), Tt (one 'T' and one 't'), and tt (both 't').\n\nThe problem says that among 798 students, 60.4% are tasters. That means 60.4% have at least one 'T' allele, right? Because if they had both 't's, they wouldn't be tasters. So, let's calculate how many students are tasters first. \n\nTotal students = 798  \nPercentage of tasters = 60.4%  \nNumber of tasters = 60.4% of 798  \n\nLet me compute that. 60.4 divided by 100 is 0.604. Multiply that by 798. Hmm, 0.6 times 800 would be 480, but since it's 0.604 and 798 is slightly less than 800, maybe around 481. But wait, let me do it accurately. 798 * 0.604. Let's break it down:\n\n798 * 0.6 = 478.8  \n798 * 0.004 = 3.192  \nAdding those gives 478.8 + 3.192 = 482 approximately. So, about 482 students are tasters.\n\nSince the total number of students is 798, the remaining must be non-tasters. So, 798 - 482 = 316 non-tasters. Wait, but looking at the options, option E has tt as 200, but according to my calculation, it should be 316. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, no, actually, when calculating the number of each genotype, we need to consider how the tasters are distributed between TT and Tt. Since the trait is determined by the presence of at least one 'T', all individuals without 't's are tasters. So, the number of tasters includes all TT and Tt individuals.\n\nNow, to find the allelic frequencies (the proportion of 'T' alleles in the population), I'll need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle. But wait, the problem doesn't specify any information about heterozygotes or other factors, so I can assume random mating and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium holds.\n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele ('T') and q is the frequency of the recessive allele ('t'). Here, p + q = 1.\n\nGiven that 60.4% are tasters, which include all TT and Tt individuals. So, the proportion of tasters is p\u00b2 + 2pq. We know p\u00b2 + 2pq = 0.604.\n\nBut we also know that q = 1 - p. So, substituting q into the equation:\n\np\u00b2 + 2p(1 - p) = 0.604  \nSimplify:  \np\u00b2 + 2p - 2p\u00b2 = 0.604  \nCombine like terms:  \n-p\u00b2 + 2p = 0.604  \nMultiply both sides by -1:  \np\u00b2 - 2p + 0.604 = 0\n\nThis is a quadratic equation:  \np\u00b2 - 2p + 0.604 = 0\n\nUsing the quadratic formula, p = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 - 4*1*0.604)] / 2  \nCalculate discriminant: sqrt(4 - 2.416) = sqrt(1.584) \u2248 1.259  \nSo, p = [2 \u00b1 1.259]/2\n\nCalculating both possibilities:  \np = (2 + 1.259)/2 \u2248 3.259/2 \u2248 1.6295 \u2192 Not possible since p can't exceed 1.  \np = (2 - 1.259)/2 \u2248 0.741/2 \u2248 0.3705\n\nSo, p \u2248 0.3705, meaning the frequency of 'T' alleles is approximately 37.05%. Therefore, the frequency of 't' alleles is q = 1 - p \u2248 0.6295, or 62.95%.\n\nNow, for part a, the allelic frequency of T is approximately 0.371, and t is 0.629.\n\nLooking at the options, option A lists these values. Option B has T as 0.396, which seems higher, and t as 0.604, which adds up correctly but doesn't match our calculations. Option C has T as 0.533, which is too high. Option D starts with 0.44, which is lower than our value. Option E has T as 0.629, which is the q value, not p. Option F swaps T and t, which is incorrect because p should be the T frequency. Option G and H have similar issues. Option I and J are duplicates of E and others. Option K and L are not listed, but based on our calculations, the correct answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",
