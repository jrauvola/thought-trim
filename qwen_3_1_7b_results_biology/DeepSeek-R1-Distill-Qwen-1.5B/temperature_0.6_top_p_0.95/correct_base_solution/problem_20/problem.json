  "problem": "A group of students were invited to taste phenylthiocarbamide (PTC). The ability to taste PTC is inherited by a single pair of genes and tasting (T) is dominant to non-tasting (t). Among 798 students, 60.4 percent were tasters, a) Calculate the allelic frequency of T and t. b) How many of the students were TT? Tt? tt?\n\nA. Frequency of T is .371, Frequency of t is .629, Number of students with TT is 109, Tt is 373, tt is 316\n\nB. Frequency of T is .396, Frequency of t is .604, Number of students with TT is 150, Tt is 348, tt is 300\n\nC. Frequency of T is .533, Frequency of t is .467, Number of students with TT is 200, Tt is 398, tt is 200\n\nD. Frequency of T is .440, Frequency of t is .560, Number of students with TT is 220, Tt is 358, tt is 220\n\nE. Frequency of T is .629, Frequency of t is .371, Number of students with TT is 180, Tt is 418, tt is 200\n\nF. Frequency of T is .604, Frequency of t is .396, Number of students with TT is 373, Tt is 316, tt is 109\n\nG. Frequency of T is .467, Frequency of t is .533, Number of students with TT is 250, Tt is 298, tt is 250\n\nH. Frequency of T is .560, Frequency of t is .440, Number of students with TT is 180, Tt is 438, tt is 180\n\nI. Frequency of T is .467, Frequency of t is .533, Number of students with TT is 109, Tt is 373, tt is 316\n\nJ. Frequency of T is .629, Frequency of t is .371, Number of students with TT is 316, Tt is 373, tt is 109",
