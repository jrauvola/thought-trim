  "solution": "\nOkay, so I've got this biology question here about pelicans and their genetics. Let me try to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the scenario says that some relatives of pelicans from the same species separated because they didn't migrate successfully. They came back 150 years later and couldn't reproduce. The question is asking what this situation exemplifies among the options provided.\n\nLet's look at the options one by one:\n\nA. Gene flow \u2013 That would be if there was an exchange of genes between populations. But in this case, the pelicans are coming back together, which suggests they're not mixing genes anymore. So maybe A isn't right.\n\nB. Temporal Isolation \u2013 This refers to different populations being isolated over time. Here, the separation happened before they joined again, and then they couldn't reproduce. It seems like they were already separate for too long, so B might not fit.\n\nC. Disruptive Selection \u2013 This is when certain traits are selected against, leading to changes in the population. If they can't reproduce, maybe some bad traits are passed on, but I'm not sure how that fits exactly without more info.\n\nD. Founder Effect \u2013 This happens when a new population arises due to a catastrophic event, like a disease or a natural disaster. After the event, the new population has unique characteristics. Since the relative group came back after failing to migrate, perhaps this was a result of such an event. Not sure yet.\n\nE. Genetic Drift \u2013 This is random changes in allele frequencies in a population, especially important in small populations. If they came back together, maybe genetic drift caused them to lose certain traits. But it's more about chance than specific events causing isolation.\n\nF. Sexual Selection \u2013 This involves selecting certain traits based on the sex. If they can't reproduce, it could be due to lack of mates or resources, but this doesn't directly explain the grouping issue.\n\nG. Sympatric Speciation \u2013 This occurs within the same species living in different environments (sympatsis). If they're from the same species but different locations, this could cause them to form groups. But the question mentions migration issues, not sympatric speciation.\n\nH. Habitat Fragmentation \u2013 This reduces habitats, making it harder for individuals to move. If they failed to migrate, maybe the fragmented habitats prevented their movement, leading to grouping. That sounds plausible.\n\nI. Bottleneck Effect \u2013 This is when a population experiences a drastic reduction in size due to a random event, leading to loss of genetic diversity. If their inability to reproduce was due to a sudden decrease in population, this could happen.\n\nJ. Allopatric Speciation \u2013 This is speciation occurring between populations geographically apart. Here, they're coming back from different places, so maybe allopatric speciation is the answer.\n\nSo considering all these, I think the key here is that they came back from different places, meaning they were previously separated. Allopatric speciation occurs when different populations form new species because they live in different environments. So J is likely the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",
