  "problem": "Monoploidlines of many species exist. Plant breeders often convert these to diploids orpolyploidsthroughcolchicine treatment. Can you see any advantages to this?\n\nA. Plant breeders can control the euploidy of their nuclei, produce genetically pure organisms, develop disease resistant strains of plants, produce larger fruits and flowers, and convert a sterile species hybrid into a fertile double diploid.\n\nB. The treatment can extend the natural lifespan of plants indefinitely\n\nC. Colchicine treatment can make plants immune to all diseases\n\nD. The treatment results in plants that can survive in zero-gravity environments\n\nE. Plant breeders can create new species\n\nF. The treatment can make plants change color spontaneously\n\nG. Colchicine treatment can eliminate the need for sunlight in plant growth\n\nH. Colchicine treatment can convert diploids to monoploids\n\nI. Colchicine treatment can make plants resistant to all herbicides\n\nJ. Colchicine treatment increases the speed of plant growth exponentially",
