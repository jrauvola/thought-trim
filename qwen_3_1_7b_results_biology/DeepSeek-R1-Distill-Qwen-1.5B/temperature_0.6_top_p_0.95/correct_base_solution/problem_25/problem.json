  "problem": "What is meant by a gene pool, balanced polymorphism, and genetic load?\n\nA. Gene pool is the total number of organisms in a population; balanced polymorphism is a genetic imbalance; genetic load is the genetic weight of an organism.\n\nB. Gene pool refers to the physical pool where genes are stored; balanced polymorphism is the imbalance of allele frequencies; genetic load is the amount of genetic information carried by an organism.\n\nC. Gene pool is the sum total of genes in a population; balanced polymorphism is when different forms of a genotype are maintained in equilibrium over time; genetic load is the reduction in average fitness due to presence of suboptimal forms.\n\nD. Gene pool is the total genetic information in the gametes of a population; balanced polymorphism is the consistent occurrence of a single allele; genetic load is the genetic diversity within a species.\n\nE. Gene pool is the collection of genes in a single organism; balanced polymorphism is the variation of a single gene; genetic load is the number of genes in an organism.\n\nF. Gene pool refers to a single gene; balanced polymorphism refers to a dominance of one gene; genetic load refers to the genetic burden of an organism.\n\nG. Gene pool is the total number of alleles in a population; balanced polymorphism is the maintenance of two or more alleles at a locus by natural selection; genetic load is the proportion of individuals in a population with genetic defects.\n\nH. Gene pool is the diversity of genes in a population; balanced polymorphism is the dominance of a single gene; genetic load is the genetic capacity of an organism.\n\nI. Gene pool is the sum of all genetic variations in a closed environment; balanced polymorphism is the equal representation of all alleles in a population; genetic load is the accumulated genetic mutations in a population.\n\nJ. Gene pool is the set of all genetic traits in a biological community; balanced polymorphism is when one allele is favored over others; genetic load is the genetic contribution of an organism to its offspring.",
