Problem: The hormone which brings about metamorphosis of the cecropia moth is secreted by a gland in the thorax. However, no metamorphosis takes place if the head is cut off, even though the larva continues to live. Explain.\n\nA. The gland in the thorax is the only gland involved, but it requires a signal from the head to start metamorphosis.\n\nB. Only the gland in the head is necessary for metamorphosis.\n\nC. The gland in the head secretes a different hormone necessary for the initiation of the metamorphosis process.\n\nD. The gland in the thorax secretes the hormone, but the head must be present to activate it.\n\nE. Metamorphosis is triggered by environmental factors, not by hormones secreted by glands.\n\nF. Metamorphosis is controlled by a gland in the abdomen, not the thorax or the head.\n\nG. The head contains an inhibitor that prevents the gland in the thorax from inducing metamorphosis.\n\nH. Neither the gland in the head nor the gland in the thorax are necessary for metamorphosis.\n\nI. Both the gland in the head and the gland in the thorax of the cecropia moth are necessary for the process of metamorphosis.\n\nJ. Only the gland in the thorax is necessary for metamorphosis.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out why the cecropia moth undergoes metamorphosis when the head isn't there, even though its larvae still survive. Let me think through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the question says that the hormone responsible for this metamorphosis is secreted by a gland in the thorax. That part seems clear. So normally, without any changes, the moth doesn't transform because the relevant hormone isn't produced. But when the head is removed, even though the larvae stay alive, the transformation happens again. Hmm, why?\n\nLet me recall what I know about metamorphosis in moths. Moths have two heads\u2014the anterior and posterior. The anterior head usually has the pivot point where they change form. If you remove one head, the other remains, but the development can still happen. Wait, does that mean both heads are needed? Or just one?\n\nWait, maybe I'm confusing it with another insect. In some insects, like grasshoppers, removing the head allows the body to develop on the remaining head. But in moths, I think both heads are required. Because without the head, the anterior tail and the posterior head might not allow the development properly. Or perhaps the anterior head's pivot is essential for proper coordination during metamorphosis.\n\nSo if the head is missing, the anterior tail would lose support, making it impossible for the development to proceed correctly. That would explain why the transformation still occurs even after cutting off the head.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Only the thorax gland requires a signal; B. Head is necessary; C. Head secretes a different hormone; D. Thorax and head both needed; E. Environmental factors; F. Abdomen; G. Inhibitor in head; H. Neither needed; I. Only head; J. Only thorax.\n\nFrom my reasoning, since both heads are necessary, option I says both are needed. But wait, let me double-check. Some sources say that in certain cases, like when developing into adults, both anterior and posterior heads are necessary, especially for the development of certain parts. Without either, the transformation fails.\n\nYes, so the correct answer should be I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",
