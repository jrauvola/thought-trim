  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which option is an example of a cline. Let me start by understanding what a cline is. From what I remember, a cline is a gradient or a range where a trait changes gradually across a species. It's like moving from one form to another smoothly. So, examples would be things where different parts of a population have similar traits but differ at the edges.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Males of some species have long antlers to fight other males for females.\nThis sounds like variation within a group rather than a gradient. Different males might have varying antlers, but it doesn't necessarily show a smooth transition or gradual change.\n\nB. A population of moths in a forest has evolved different color patterns depending on the type of tree they inhabit.\nMoths can switch colors based on the environment, right? Like if there's a lot of light, they use shorter wavelengths; if there's darkness, longer wavelengths. This seems like a smooth transition because different trees (and thus different environments) lead to different color choices. That fits the definition of a cline.\n\nC. A species of fish has developed a unique color pattern in response to changes in water temperature.\nWater temp affects fish behavior and colors. Maybe cooler water makes them darker, warmer makes them lighter. But does it vary smoothly across a range of temperatures? Not sure, but it could be a cline.\n\nD. Certain species of spiders have evolved different web-building behaviors depending on the availability of prey.\nPrey availability changes as you move through a spider population. For example, finding more prey might make them build sparser webs. Again, a gradual change across the population.\n\nE. The hybrid tomato plant is stronger and produces better fruit than the pure genotype.\nHybrids usually inherit some traits from each parent. So, maybe the hybrid is stronger because it combines traits from both parents, creating a new trait. But this seems more about combining traits rather than a continuous gradient.\n\nF. A certain type of beetle exhibits a wide range of body size, with larger individuals found in colder regions.\nBody size variation across the beetle population shows a range, not just a gradual change. So, F isn't a cline.\n\nG. Two distinct varieties in one population of snail that inhabits an island.\nSnails can have different forms depending on the environment, but this seems like different phenotypes rather than a smooth gradient. G doesn't fit a cline.\n\nH. Rabbit variants that evolved in different climates are white and brown.\nDifferent climate zones leading to different traits is a clear cline. This matches the definition well.\n\nI. Plants producing toxins to deter herbivores.\nToxicity levels can vary across a plant population, affecting how much they protect themselves. This is a gradual change, fitting a cline.\n\nJ. Gene frequencies vary with altitude in birds.\nHigher altitudes might have different bird populations, leading to variations in allele frequencies. This is a cline too.\n\nSo, looking back, B, H, I, J all seem like they involve gradual changes across a population. But the question asks for a single answer, so I think the best choice is H because it directly describes a cline involving environmental factors.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",
