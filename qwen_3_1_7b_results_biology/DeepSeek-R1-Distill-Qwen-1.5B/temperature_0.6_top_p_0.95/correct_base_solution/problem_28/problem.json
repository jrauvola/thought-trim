How do these organismsosmoregulatein face of aprepetualthreat of dehydration?\n\nA. Marine organisms osmoregulate by secreting excess water through their gills.\n\nB. Marine organisms osmoregulate by periodically releasing salt crystals through their digestive tract.\n\nC. Marine organisms osmoregulate by reducing their body fluid concentration\n\nD. Marine organisms osmoregulate by avoiding sea water\n\nE. Marine organisms osmoregulate by retaining urea in their bloodstream to balance the osmotic pressure.\n\nF. Marine organisms osmoregulate by undergoing periodic dehydration and rehydration cycles.\n\nG. Marine organisms osmoregulate by producing large amounts of mucus to trap salt particles.\n\nH. Marine organisms osmoregulate by absorbing salt through their skin to match the sea water's salinity.\n\nI. Marine organisms osmoregulate by consuming more sea water\n\nJ. Marine organisms osmoregulate by actively transporting out excess salt from their body fluids, often through specialized glands.",
