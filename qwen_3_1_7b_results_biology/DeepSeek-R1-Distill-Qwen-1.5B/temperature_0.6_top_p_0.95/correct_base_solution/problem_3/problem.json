  "problem": "Contrast the meanings of the terms \"gene pool\" and \"genotype\\textquotedblright.\n\nA. A gene pool is the genetic makeup present in the environment, while a genotype is the genetic makeup that an organism inherits from its parents.\n\nB. A gene pool is the set of all genes within a single organism, while a genotype refers to the genetic variations among different populations.\n\nC. A gene pool is the genetic constitution of an individual, while a genotype is the total genetic information in a population.\n\nD. A gene pool is the collection of genes that predict an organism's phenotype, while a genotype is the combination of alleles that an organism possesses for a single trait.\n\nE. A genotype is the unique genetic code found within a cell, while a gene pool encompasses the various genotypes that interact within an ecosystem.\n\nF. Genotype refers to the breeding potential of a population, while a gene pool is the set of all possible genes that can be passed down through reproduction.\n\nG. A gene pool and genotype both refer to the genetic constitution of an individual.\n\nH. A gene pool and genotype both refer to the total genetic information in a population.\n\nI. A gene pool is the total genetic information in a population, while a genotype is the genetic constitution of an individual.\n\nJ. A gene pool refers to a collection of physical traits in a population, while a genotype is the specific genetic makeup responsible for one particular trait.",
