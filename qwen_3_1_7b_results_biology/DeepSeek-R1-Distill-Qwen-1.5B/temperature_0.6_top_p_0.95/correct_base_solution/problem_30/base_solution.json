  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer correctly describes the theory of evolution. Let me start by recalling what I know about evolution. Evolution is the process by which species change over generations, right? It's usually attributed to natural selection, where organisms better adapted to their environment pass on those traits to their offspring.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA says it's a universal fact about all species' origins and development. That sounds too broad because not everything has evolved yet; many are still forming.\n\nB suggests it's a hypothesis being tested. I think evolution isn't just a hypothesis; it's been extensively tested through various experiments and evidence.\n\nC claims it's disproven, but nope, evolution is well-established and widely accepted.\n\nD talks about speculating about population changes, but evolution doesn't predict future changes\u2014it explains past ones.\n\nE is an opinion held by scientists, but evolution is more than just science; it's widely accepted as true across many fields.\n\nF seems correct. It mentions an overarching explanation supported by evidence, which fits because evolution provides such explanations.\n\nG gives another possibility, but F covers that without being redundant.\n\nSo, the best answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
