B suggests it's a hypothesis under testing. That makes sense because theories can be tested. C claims it's disproven, but no, evolution isn't proven yet; it's just widely accepted. D talks about speculating changes in populations, but evolution explains stable patterns rather than random changes. E is an opinion from scientists, which could be true, but it's more specific than the general description.
