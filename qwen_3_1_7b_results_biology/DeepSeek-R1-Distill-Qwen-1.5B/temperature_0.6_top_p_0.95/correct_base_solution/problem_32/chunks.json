Water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as a lubricant, aids in transport of nutrients, and maintains osmotic relationships.\n\nB. Water is detrimental to the regulation of heat in the body.\n\nC. Water is a poor solvent, making it unsuitable for chemical reactions in cells.\n\nD. Water provides no thermal insulation and cannot dissolve gases.\n\nE. Water is not involved in maintaining structural integrity of biological molecules.\n\nF. Water is only involved in the transport of nutrients, but has no role in heat regulation or as a solvent.\n\nG. Water is scarce and difficult to dissolve substances in.\n\nH. Water's high surface tension is detrimental to the movement of substances in living organisms.\n\nI. Water has a low heat capacity, which makes it ineffective in temperature regulation.\n\nJ. Water serves no functional purpose in living organisms.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what properties of water make it essential for life. Let me start by recalling what I know about water. It's a crucial part of our bodies, right? But why exactly?\n\nFirst, I remember that water is a solvent. Solvents are substances that can dissolve other substances, and water does this all around us\u2014like dissolving salts in blood, dissolving sugars in cells, etc. So that's one property.\n\nThen there's its ability to regulate temperature. When we sweat, our body loses heat, and water helps keep our internal temperature stable. That must be another key feature.\n\nTransporting nutrients also comes to mind. Cells rely on water to move ions and other small molecules through their membranes. Without water, these processes would probably stop because water helps maintain the structure of cell membranes.\n\nOh, and water plays a big role in osmosis. It helps cells absorb water when placed in a hypotonic environment and lose water when placed in a hypertonic one. That's important for maintaining the balance of different substances inside and outside cells.\n\nWait, but some options mention things like being a poor solvent (which contradicts my earlier thought) or having high surface tension. High surface tension could affect how substances move, but maybe it's more about diffusion than actual solubility.\n\nLet me look at the options again:\n\nA says water is abundant, a good solvent, regulates heat, serves as lubricant, transports nutrients, maintains osmotic relations. That seems comprehensive.\n\nB talks about being detrimental to heat regulation, which doesn't sound right since water does help regulate body temperature.\n\nC mentions being a poor solvent, which conflicts with A since A states it's a good solvent.\n\nD says water isn't a solvent, which is incorrect because water is known as a solvent.\n\nE suggests it's not involved in structural integrity, but I don't think water is involved structurally; rather, it's about function.\n\nF points out that it's involved in transporting nutrients but not in heat or as a solvent, but A covers more aspects.\n\nG says water is scarce and hard to dissolve, which isn't true\u2014it's abundant and soluble.\n\nH mentions high surface tension hindering substance movement, which is correct but perhaps not the primary reason.\n\nI says water has low heat capacity, affecting temp regulation, which is accurate but secondary to its role as a solvent.\n\nSo putting it together, option A covers all the main properties: abundance, good solvent, regulating heat, lubrication, nutrient transport, osmotic relations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",
