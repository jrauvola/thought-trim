  "problem": "The same gene that causes various coat patterns in wild and domesticated cats also causes the cross-eyed condition in these cats, the cross-eyed condition being slightly maladaptive. In a hypothetical environment, the coat pattern that is associated with crossed eyes is highly adaptive, with the result that both the coat pattern and the cross-eyed condition increase in a feline population over time. Which statement is supported by these observations?\n\nA. Genetic mutations causing the coat pattern are more likely to occur in this population.\n\nB. Natural selection always results in the elimination of maladaptive traits.\n\nC. Polygenic inheritance is generally maladaptive, and should become less common in future generations.\n\nD. This scenario disproves the theory of evolution.\n\nE. The cross-eyed condition is actually an adaptive trait in this environment.\n\nF. The coat pattern gene and the cross-eyed condition gene are separate and unrelated.\n\nG. Phenotype is often the result of compromise.\n\nH. Evolution is progressive and tends toward a more perfect population.\n\nI. Natural selection reduces the frequency of maladaptive genes in populations over the course of time.\n\nJ. The cross-eyed condition will eventually disappear from the population as it is maladaptive.",
