Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nAlright, so I've got this question about hemophilia and probability. Let me try to work through it step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that hemophilia is a sex-linked genetic disorder. It's usually inherited from one parent, especially when the gene is located on the X chromosome. The problem mentions an a phenotypically normal couple who have a son with hemophilia. So, let's break down what that means.\n\nSince the father has hemophilia, he must carry the hemophilia gene. But because it's a recessive disorder, both alleles need to be affected for the child to have it. In hemophilia, the allele (let's call it h) is recessive. That means a person must inherit two copies of the defective gene (h) to show the condition. If they get just one h, they'll be phenotypically normal.\n\nNow, since the father has hemophilia, his genotype must be either Hh or hh. But wait, in hemophilia, males typically have only one copy of the X chromosome, which can carry the defective gene. So, if the father has hemophilia, he must have at least one h allele. Therefore, his genotype could be Hh (where H is the normal allele) or hh.\n\nBut wait, if he were hh, then he wouldn't pass the h allele to his children, right? Because both his X chromosomes would carry the h. So, if he were hh, all his sons would be normal, and daughters would have a 50% chance of being hemophilic. But the problem says he has a son with hemophilia, which suggests that he does have the h allele. So, he must be Hh.\n\nSo, now we're looking at the mother. Since she's a phenotypically normal woman, her genotype must be HH. Because if she were Hh, she might pass an h allele, but given the son already has hemophilia, the mother likely doesn't pass an h allele. Wait, no\u2014since the father is Hh, the mother must be HH to pass the H allele. Otherwise, there's a 50% chance that she passes an h to the son.\n\nWait, but the problem states that the couple is \"a phenotypically normal,\" so perhaps both are carriers. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me think again.\n\nThe key here is understanding the inheritance pattern. For hemophilia, males must inherit the defective X chromosome to express the condition. Females can only inherit it from one side, so if they inherit two, they will have hemophilia. If they inherit one, they won't.\n\nIn this case, the father has hemophilia, so he must have at least one X with the h allele. Since hemophilia is recessive, he must have HXhY. Wait, no\u2014if he's male, his genotype would be HXhY. So, he has one X with the h allele and one without (HX). Therefore, any daughter would receive an X from him, and a Y from her. So, each daughter has a 50% chance of getting the Xh, leading to hemophilia.\n\nFor sons, they would get an X from the father and a Y from the mother. Since the father has Xh, each son has a 50% chance of inheriting Xh and thus having hemophilia.\n\nWait, but the problem says the couple is \"a phenotypically normal.\" So, the mother must not have hemophilia, meaning she doesn't have the Xh. Therefore, she must be HH. So, her X chromosomes are both H, one from each parent.\n\nTherefore, the father has XH and Xh (because he has hemophilia). Each daughter gets an X from the father and one from the mother. Since the mother contributes an H, each daughter has a 50% chance of receiving Xh, resulting in hemophilia.\n\nEach son gets an X from the father (either H or h) and a Y from the mother. Since the father has a 50% chance of passing H and a 50% chance of passing h, each son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the father already has a son with hemophilia. So, that means the father passed the h allele to the son. Therefore, the father must be XHh, as that allows him to pass the h allele to the son.\n\nNow, going back to the mother. She is phenotypically normal, so she must be HH, as she cannot contribute an h allele (otherwise, the son would have hemophilia).\n\nSo, the father is XHh, and the mother is HH.\n\nWhen they have a son, the son has a 50% chance of inheriting the Xh from the father (so hemophilia) and a 50% chance of inheriting the XH from the father (so no hemophilia).\n\nIf they have a daughter, she receives an X from the father and an X from the mother. Since the mother is HH, she always gives an H. Therefore, every daughter has a 50% chance of inheriting Xh (hemophilia) and a 50% chance of inheriting XH (no hemophilia).\n\nBut the question is specifically asking: What is the probability that their next child, if a girl, would also have hemophilia?\n\nAh, okay. So, after they've had a son with hemophilia, the next child could be a girl or a boy, depending on previous outcomes. But the question is phrased as: What is the probability that their next child, if a girl, would also have hemophilia?\n\nSo, it's conditional probability: Given that the next child is a girl, what's the probability she has hemophilia.\n\nFrom earlier analysis, we know that daughters have a 50% chance of having hemophilia. However, since the father has a 50% chance of passing the h allele to a daughter, the overall probability that a daughter has hemophilia is 25%.\n\nWait, let me clarify:\n\nFather's genotype: XHh (since he has hemophilia)\n\nMother's genotype: HH (normal)\n\nProbability a daughter inherits Xh from father: 50%\n\nProbability a daughter inherits XH: 50%\n\nSo, each daughter has a 50% chance of hemophilia. Therefore, the probability that a daughter has hemophilia is 50%.\n\nSimilarly, each son has a 50% chance of having hemophilia.\n\nGiven that the father has a son with hemophilia, we can infer that the father passed the h allele to the son. Now, considering the next child, which is a girl, what's the probability she has hemophilia?\n\nIt's still 50%, because among the daughters, half will have hemophilia, and half won't.\n\nAlternatively, thinking of all possible children:\n\nFather: XHh\n\nMother: HH\n\nPossible children:\n\nBoys:\n- XH (from father) + Y (from mother): Normal\n- Xh (from father) + Y (from mother): Hemophilia\n\nGirls:\n- XH (from father) + XH (from mother): Normal\n- Xh (from father) + XH (from mother): Hemophilia\n\nSo, boys have a 50% chance of hemophilia, girls have a 50% chance, but each has a 50% chance of hemophilia within the girls.\n\nThus, the overall probability of a daughter having hemophilia is 25%.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be G. No chance, because the probability is 25%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
