  "problem": "Both food and air pass through the pharynx. Explain how these are channeled into the proper tubes so that the food goes into the stomach and the air goes to the lungs.\n\nA. The diaphragm contracts to direct food into the esophagus and air into the trachea\n\nB. Food and air are channeled by the action of vocal cords that open and close the respective tubes\n\nC. A flap in the stomach opens to let food in, while a separate flap in the lungs allows air to enter\n\nD. When we swallow, the larynx moves up so that the glottis is closed by the epiglottis and the food or liquid passes into the esophagus behind the trachea. Swallowing is a complex reflex initiated when pressure receptors in the wall of the pharynx are stimulated.\n\nE. The bronchi contract to prevent food from entering the lungs, while the esophageal sphincter relaxes to allow food into the stomach\n\nF. The epiglottis directs air into the stomach and food into the lungs\n\nG. The trachea closes and the esophagus opens to allow food to enter the stomach and air to remain in the pharynx\n\nH. The soft palate rises to block the nasal passage during swallowing, guiding food into the esophagus\n\nI. Food and air are directed into the correct tubes by the nasal cavity\n\nJ. Food and air are separated by the tongue",
