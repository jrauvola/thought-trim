  "problem": "The cells of humans and most animals have become adapted to surviving only within a relatively small range of hydrogen ion concentrations. What is the role of the kidneys in regulating hydrogen ion concentration?\n\nA. The kidneys filter out hydrogen ions and recycle them into other cellular processes.\n\nB. The kidneys regulate the hydrogen ion concentration of the extracellular fluids by excreting either acidic or basic constituents when the levels deviate from normal.\n\nC. The kidneys maintain a constant production of hydrogen ions, regardless of the body's needs.\n\nD. The kidneys produce hydrogen ions to maintain balance.\n\nE. The kidneys eliminate all hydrogen ions from the body.\n\nF. The kidneys detect hydrogen ion levels and signal other organs to adjust their pH levels accordingly.\n\nG. The kidneys release enzymes that directly neutralize hydrogen ions in the bloodstream.\n\nH. The kidneys convert hydrogen ions into inert gases that are exhaled.\n\nI. The kidneys store hydrogen ions for future use.\n\nJ. The kidneys absorb all hydrogen ions, preventing them from affecting the body's pH balance.",
