The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio.

But since each option is an individual possibility, perhaps some are combined? No, wait, no, each letter represents a possible genotype pair. Let me think differently.\n\nThe key here is that the ratio of offspring is \u00be black to \u00bc white. This suggests that each parent must contribute a certain type of gamete. For the offspring to be \u00be black, each parent must carry at least one dominant allele because if both parents had recessive alleles (e.g., bb), then all offspring would be bb, showing white. However, our case doesn't fit that because the parents aren't both bb, as that would produce 100% white offspring. Similarly, if one parent was Bb and the other was bb, then the offspring would have a mix\u2014some Bb and some bb. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all offspring will inherit the b allele from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So the offspring would be Bb (if they get B from the Bb parent and b from the bb parent) and bb (if they get b from both). Therefore, half of the offspring would be Bb (black) and half would be bb (white). That would give a 50:50 ratio, not 75:25. So maybe that's not the right path.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, then each can contribute B or b. The possible gametes are equal for each parent. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: Bb  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nEach gamete from Parent 1: 50% B, 50% b. Same for Parent 2. So when you combine them:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since B is dominant, BB and Bb are black, and bb is white. So 75% black, 25% white. That fits exactly with the given data. So if both parents are Bb, that makes sense.\n\nLet me check another possibility just to be sure. Suppose one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Then the possible gametes are B from BB and B from Bb. So all offspring would receive B from one parent and either B or b from the other. Thus, all offspring would be BB or Bb, which are all black. That would give a 100% black ratio, which is not the case here. So that's not correct.\n\nAnother possibility: If one parent is BB and the other is bb. Then the offspring would always be Bb, resulting in 100% black. Again, not matching.\n\nWhat if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? We've already considered that; all offspring are BB or Bb, so 100% black.\n\nIf both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, 100% black.\n\nSo the only way to get 75% black and 25% white is if both parents are heterozygous for the black allele, meaning their genotype is Bb each. Because then, each parent can contribute B or b, leading to a 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb or BB (black).\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb.

Option B combines two different parents (BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb). Option I is BB \u00d7 bb. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nSo the correct answer should be G or H, depending on whether the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or BB \u00d7 Bb.

Looking back, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which seems correct because sometimes the notation can vary. I'll go through each possible parent pair and see which one results in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nFirst, understanding the basics: If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then their cross should produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. When considering coat color, since B is dominant, any genotype with at least one B will result in black; bb is white. So the expected ratio would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white, matching the problem statement. That makes sense. But wait, let me check another possibility where the parents aren't both Bb. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, what happens?\n\nLet me think: If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the Punnett square would show:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). The phenotype would be BB = black, Bb = black, and bb = white. So the ratio would be 3:1 as well\u201425% black, 25% black, 25% white. Wait, no\u2014that adds up to 75% black and 25% white, which doesn't match the problem. Because the problem says 75% black and 25% white. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have 75% black and 25% white, which fits the description. But wait, that's not one of the options. Looking at the options provided, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would give 3:1, same as my first thought. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would also result in 3:1, but perhaps the order is different. However, let me check other possibilities too.\n\nWhat if both parents are Bb? Then the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotype-wise, 75% black and 25% white. That matches exactly. So why am I confused now? Because earlier I considered a case where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, which also gives 75% black and 25% white. So does that mean both H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would fit? Or is there something else I'm missing?\n\nWait, let's double-check. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the Punnett square is indeed BB \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So phenotype-wise, BB and Bb are both black, and bb is white. So 75% black, 25% white. That's correct. So both H and G would result in the correct ratio. But looking at the options, H is BB \u00d7 Bb and G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Both are valid, but they're essentially the same cross, just reversed. So the genotype of the parents would be BB and Bb, regardless of the order.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options again, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Let me compute that cross. Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotype: BB and Bb are black; bb is white. So 75% black, 25% white. Correct. So why are options C and H giving the correct answer? Or did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, let me verify with another approach. Using probability. Each parent must contribute an allele. For the offspring to have a 75% chance of being black, each parent must have a certain genotype. Alternatively, using Punnett squares, the cross that leads to 3:1 is when each parent is heterozygous (Bb). So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Thus, option H is correct.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought of a cross involving BB and Bb, which also gives 75% black. But according to the standard dihybrid cross, only Bb \u00d7 Bb results in 3:1. Other combinations like BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb don't. So why was I confused before? Maybe I mixed up some cases.\n\nSo going back, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would still have 75% black and 25% white. So why wouldn't that be an option? It appears that both H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 BB) are correct, but perhaps they are considered the same. However, the way the options are presented, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and G is Bb \u00d7 BB.

So maybe I misread that. It probably should be a single pair of parents, not multiple pairs. Let me correct that understanding. So perhaps the options are simplified, and each letter represents a possible cross between two parents.\n\nGiven that the offspring ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, this implies that each offspring must have at least one dominant allele (B) since the recessive is white. So the possible genotypes for the parents must lead to that. Now, considering that when two heterozygotes (Bb) mate, the F1 generation will all be Bb (since Bb \u00d7 Bb = Bb for each gamete, leading to all Bb offspring).

Hmm, maybe it's a different type of cross.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), then the F1 would all be Bb, and the F2 would show a 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio. But in our case, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white, which matches exactly with the F2 of a cross where both parents are Bb. Because Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So all the Bb individuals would express the dominant trait (black), and the bb would express the recessive (white). That fits perfectly with the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nSo now, looking back at the options, which ones involve Bb \u00d7 Bb? Option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. That makes sense because that would produce the 25% black and 75% white ratio. However, another possibility is that one parent is BB and the other is Bb. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the F1 would all be Bb, and the F2 would have 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Again, same outcome\u201475% black, 25% white.\n\nLet me check the options:\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 correct.\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 also correct, because BB \u00d7 Bb would still give Bb F1s, leading to the same 75% black and 25% white.\n\nBut wait, the question asks which genotype was \"most likely.\" Are there any other possibilities?\n\nLooking at the other options:\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 This would result in all the offspring being Bb (since bb can't contribute B, and Bb can contribute B or b). Then, in the next generation, they would all be Bb, so all black. Which doesn't match the observed ratio.\n\nOption D: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 No, because the question specifies a cross between two guinea pigs, implying a single parent pair. So options with more than one cross aren't relevant here.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Same as option C; all offspring would be Bb, all black.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 The offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb. But the observed ratio is 75% black and 25% white, so this wouldn't fit.\n\nOptions A, B, D, etc., don't seem to fit the required ratio unless they are homozygous or have different combinations.\n\nSo between G and H, both would produce the correct ratio. But the question says \"the most likely\" genotype. Both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would lead to the same ratio. Wait, no\u2014the question might be testing whether each parent is Bb or something else. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb (option G) versus BB \u00d7 Bb (option H).\n\nWait, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 would be Bb, and F2 would have 75% black. Similarly, if both parents are Bb, the F2 would have 75% black. So both scenarios (BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in the same ratio. Therefore, the parents could be either BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 Bb. But among the options, only G and H are those possibilities.\n\nHowever, looking at the options again, I see that option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So both are valid. But the question is about the most likely genotype. Since both parents being Bb would make the F2 have 75% black, same as one being BB and the other Bb. So both are equally likely based on the information given.\n\nWait, but the options include G and H, but the question is about the most likely. Maybe both are correct, but in the context of the answer choices, the intended answer might be G. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question states that the cross was between two guinea pigs, both black. The offspring showed \u00be black and \u00bc white. The possible genotype pairs are:\n\nIf both parents are Bb, the F2 would have 75% black and 25% white (as calculated earlier).\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F2 would also have 75% black and 25% white.\n\nTherefore, both cases (BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 Bb) lead to the observed ratio. However, the question asks which genotype was \"most likely\" the parents had. Since both scenarios are possible, but in the options, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Perhaps the intended answer is G, assuming that the parents are both Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to consider that the parents are both Bb, making the F2 have 75% black and 25% white. So the answer would be G. Or, if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, then it's also correct. But without additional information, both are possible. However, in the options provided, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, both are correct, but the question asks for the most likely. Since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G.\n\nWait, but looking back, the options are labeled G to H, with G being Bb \u00d7 Bb and H being BB \u00d7 Bb. So both are possible. However, the question may be expecting that both parents are Bb, hence option G. Alternatively, the correct answer could be either G or H. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is G.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I need to think differently. Let me calculate the probability of each parent's genotype leading to the observed ratio.\n\nIn the F2 generation, the probability of each genotype is as follows:\n\nFor a dihybrid cross (but here it's monohybrid), the F2 would be:\n\n- 25% BB (homozygous dominant)\n- 50% Bb (heterozygous)\n- 25% bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nBut in this case, the observed ratio is 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). So the parents must have produced a cross that results in all offspring being Bb or BB.\n\nNow, the parents could be:\n\n1. BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F1: Bb, F2: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), 25% bb (white). That gives 75% black, 25% white.\n\n2. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F2: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So same as above.\n\nThus, both scenarios (parents being BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in the same ratio. Therefore, both G and H are correct. However, since the question provides separate options, perhaps the intended answer is G.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the initial analysis, the parents could be either BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 Bb. But the options include both. However, in reality, any cross involving two Bb parents would result in the same F2 ratio, regardless of which order the parents are crossed. So, if the question allows for either parent pair, then both G and H are correct. But since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G, as it's the first such option.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which seems like a bit odd because the question refers to the cross between two guinea pigs as their parents. So maybe I misread that. It probably should be a single pair of parents, not multiple pairs. Let me correct that understanding. So perhaps the options are simplified, and each letter represents a possible cross between two parents.\n\nGiven that the offspring ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, this implies that each offspring must have at least one dominant allele (B) since the recessive is white. So the possible genotypes for the parents must lead to that. Now, considering that when two heterozygotes (Bb) mate, the F1 generation will all be Bb (since Bb \u00d7 Bb = Bb for each gamete, leading to all Bb offspring). Then, in the F2 generation, you'd get 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Wait, but in our case, the ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, which doesn't fit the expected 9:3:4 or 9:6:1 pattern. Hmm, maybe it's a different type of cross.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), then the F1 would all be Bb, and the F2 would show a 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio. But in our case, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white, which matches exactly with the F2 of a cross where both parents are Bb. Because Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be duplicates because when you have multiple parents, sometimes they can produce different combinations. But perhaps the correct approach is to consider possible parent pairs and see which one results in the observed \u00be black, \u00bc white ratio.\n\nThe key here is that the offspring show a 3:1 phenotypic ratio, which typically happens when there are two independent genes involved, like coat color and another trait. However, since the question specifies only about the coat color, maybe it's just a simple dihybrid situation where one gene determines the phenotype. Alternatively, it could involve more than one gene, but the simplest explanation is probably considering a single gene locus with a dominance relationship.\n\nLet me think about the possible parent combinations:\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive. Their offspring will all be homozygous recessive (bb), so all will have white coats. That doesn't match the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is homozygous recessive (bb), the other is homozygous dominant (BB). All offspring will get one b from the bb parent and one B from the BB parent, so their genotype will be Bb. Since B is dominant over b, all offspring will express the dominant trait, meaning all will have black coats. Again, no white coats. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Here, one parent is heterozygous (Bb), and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). Using a Punnett square, each offspring will have a 50% chance of being Bb (heterozygous, dominant) and 50% chance of being bb (recessive, white). So 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. Not matching the question.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option E. The BB parent will give B to all offspring, and the Bb parent will contribute B or b. Wait, no\u2014actually, wait, the Bb parent can pass either B or b, while the BB parent must pass B. So each child gets B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. Thus, all offspring are B_, meaning all have Bb genotype, hence all have black coats. No white. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Similarly, same as above. The Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent gives B. So all offspring have B_ (i.e., Bb or BB), which means all have B, so all have black coats. Again, 100% black, 0% white. Doesn't match.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. This is similar to option F but reversed. Here, the BB parent gives B, and the bb parent gives b. So each offspring is Bb, leading to 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So again, 1:1 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All offspring will be BB, so all have black coats. No white. Doesn't fit.\n\nNow, back to Option C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's analyze this. The Bb parent can give either B or b, and the bb parent must give b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (from B from Bb and b from bb) and bb (from b from Bb and b from bb). Therefore, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So 1:1 ratio, same issue as before.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that \u00be black and \u00bc white requires a 3:1 ratio, which is typical of a single gene with two alleles, one dominant, one recessive. So perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that the parents need to produce an equal number of each phenotype. Let me check the initial statement again: \"Black hair coat is dominant over white.\" So the presence of at least one dominant allele leads to black, otherwise white. So, if the parents are such that all the offspring have at least one dominant allele, then all would have black; if half have dominant and half have recessive, then 50% black, 50% white.\n\nBut in our case, it's \u00be black, \u00bc white. That suggests that three-quarters of the offspring have at least one dominant allele (so black), and one-quarter have none (so white). How can that happen?\n\nAh, right! If the parents are such that both are heterozygotes (Bb). Then the Punnett square shows a 3:1 ratio. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb produces \u00be B_ (black) and \u00bc bb (white). But wait, in that case, both parents are Bb. Looking at the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. But according to my previous analysis, that would lead to \u00be black and \u00bc white. However, I didn't include that option yet. Let me double-check the options.\n\nLooking back, yes, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. So why wasn't that considered initially? Because I thought that the parents needed to be either homozygous or something else, but in reality, if both parents are Bb, their cross would produce \u00be B_ (black) and \u00bc bb (white). So the answer should be G.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would produce B_ (dominant) 75% and bb 25%. Which matches the 3:1 ratio. So looking back at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let me re-examine that. BB parent gives B, Bb gives B or b. So the offspring will be B_ in all cases, meaning all black. Hence, 100% black, 0% white. Doesn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. As discussed, 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white).\n\nSo the only way to get \u00be black and \u00bc white is if all offspring have at least one dominant allele, meaning all are B_. That requires that both parents are Bb, so their cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, giving \u00be B_ (black) and \u00bc bb (white). So option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

It seems like the correct answer will be among these, but I might need to calculate based on the possible parents' combinations.\n\nSo, first, since the coat color is determined by a single gene with dominant B (black) and recessive b (white), the parents must each contribute alleles for this gene. The offspring's distribution shows a 3:1 ratio, meaning that the parents must produce gametes in such a way that when combined, they give a 3:1 outcome. For a 3:1 ratio, the parents must be heterozygous for the dominant trait because if both were homozygous (like BB or BB), then all offspring would be BB (black), resulting in a 1:0 ratio. Similarly, if one was BB and the other Bb, the ratio would be 3:1 as well because some would get B from the Bb parent and b from the BB parent, making Bb (black), while the others would get B from both parents, making BB (black). Wait, but in this case, the ratio is 3:1 black:white, so maybe the parents are both Bb? Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, the F1 generation (which is technically the same as the parents in this context) gives a 1:2:1 ratio for BB:Bb:BbBB, but wait, I'm getting confused here.\n\nWait no, the parents themselves are being crossed, not the F1. So, the parents are the ones contributing their genes to the F2 generation. But perhaps I should approach this differently. The key point is that the offspring have a 3:1 ratio of black to white. This implies that the dominant allele is present in three-fourths of the cases. Now, the 3:1 ratio can come from several parent combinations:\n\n1. If both parents are Bb:\n   - Each parent can give B or b.\n   - Possible gametes: 50% B and 50% b.\n   - Punnett square for Bb \u00d7 Bb would show four possibilities: BB, Bb, Bb, bb.\n   - Ratios: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Since black is dominant, BB and Bb are black, and bb is white. So the ratio is 75% black : 25% white. That matches the given data perfectly.\n\n2. Another possibility is if one parent is BB and the other is Bb:\n   - Gametes from BB: all B.\n   - Gametes from Bb: 50% B and 50% b.\n   - Combining, the F2 would have:\n     - From BB \u00d7 Bb:\n       - BB (100% B): BB (from BB) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 all BB (black).\n       - Bb (from Bb \u00d7 BB) \u2192 Bb (black).\n     - From Bb \u00d7 Bb: same as before, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), 25% bb (white).\n     - So overall, 100% black from the BB parent plus 75% black and 25% white from the Bb parent. So total black would be 100% + 75% = 175%, but wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces gametes separately. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, considering the F2 from two parents where one is BB and the other is Bb: The F1 would be BB \u00d7 Bb, producing a dihybrid cross. The ratio would be 3:1 (black:white) because half the time it's BB \u00d7 Bb (both black), and half the time it's Bb \u00d7 Bb (where one B and one b combine, giving 75% black and 25% white). So overall, the ratio becomes 3/4 black (from BB \u00d7 Bb) and 1/4 white (from Bb \u00d7 Bb). Hmm, that also gives a 3:1 ratio. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me clarify. When one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the offspring from crossing these two would have a 3:1 ratio of black to white. Because:\n\n- BB (parent 1) can only give B.\n- Bb (parent 2) can give B or b.\n\nSo when parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives B, it's BB (black).\n\nWhen parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives b, it's Bb (black).\n\nWhen parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives b, it's another Bb (black).\n\nBut wait, there are three possibilities when combining parent 1 and parent 2:\n\nEach parent produces gametes independently. Parent 1 always gives B. Parent 2 gives B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo combining:\n\n- All times, the offspring will receive B from parent 1 and either B or b from parent 2.\n\nThus, the offspring will be either BB (if parent 2 gives B) or Bb (if parent 2 gives b).\n\nSince parent 2 gives B 50% of the time and b 50% of the time, the F2 generation will be:\n\n- 50% BB (black)\n- 50% Bb (black)\n\nWhich is 50% black and 50% white. That's a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents cannot be BB and Bb. Hence, option D is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: Both parents are Bb. As previously discussed, this results in a 3:1 ratio because:\n\nParent 1 gives B or b.\n\nParent 2 gives B or b.\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nBlack is dominant, so BB and Bb are black; bb is white. Thus, 75% black, 25% white. That fits the given data perfectly.\n\nSo, if both parents are Bb, the F1 (assuming they self-pollinate) would show the 3:1 ratio. However, the question states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both of which had black coats. So the parents must be able to produce black and possibly white alleles. The 3:1 ratio suggests that the parents are both Bb because when each gives a B, they can produce BB (black), Bb (black), and when one gives B and the other gives b, they produce Bb (black). Only when both give b do they produce bb (white). Thus, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. That makes sense.

Another possibility is if one parent is BB and the other is Bb:\n   - Gametes from BB: all B.\n   - Gametes from Bb: 50% B and 50% b.\n   - Combining, the F2 would have:\n     - From BB \u00d7 Bb:\n       - BB (100% B): BB (from BB) and Bb (from Bb) \u2192 all BB (black).\n       - Bb (from Bb \u00d7 BB) \u2192 Bb (black).\n     - From Bb \u00d7 Bb: same as before, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), 25% bb (white).\n     - So overall, 100% black from the BB parent plus 75% black and 25% white from the Bb parent. So total black would be 100% + 75% = 175%, but wait, that doesn't add up. Wait, no\u2014each parent produces gametes separately. Maybe I'm mixing things up. Alternatively, considering the F2 from two parents where one is BB and the other is Bb: The F1 would be BB \u00d7 Bb, producing a dihybrid cross. The ratio would be 3:1 (black:white) because half the time it's BB \u00d7 Bb (both black), and half the time it's Bb \u00d7 Bb (where one B and one b combine, giving 75% black and 25% white). So overall, the ratio becomes 3/4 black (from BB \u00d7 Bb) and 1/4 white (from Bb \u00d7 Bb). Hmm, that also gives a 3:1 ratio. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me clarify. When one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the offspring from crossing these two would have a 3:1 ratio of black to white. Because:\n\n- BB (parent 1) can only give B.\n- Bb (parent 2) can give B or b.\n\nSo when parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives B, it's BB (black).\n\nWhen parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives b, it's Bb (black).\n\nWhen parent 1 gives B, and parent 2 gives b, it's another Bb (black).\n\nBut wait, there are three possibilities when combining parent 1 and parent 2:\n\nEach parent produces gametes independently. Parent 1 always gives B. Parent 2 gives B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo combining:\n\n- All times, the offspring will receive B from parent 1 and either B or b from parent 2.\n\nThus, the offspring will be either BB (if parent 2 gives B) or Bb (if parent 2 gives b).\n\nSince parent 2 gives B 50% of the time and b 50% of the time, the F2 generation will be:\n\n- 50% BB (black)\n- 50% Bb (black)\n\nWhich is 50% black and 50% white. That's a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents cannot be BB and Bb. Hence, option D is incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: Both parents are Bb. As previously discussed, this results in a 3:1 ratio because:\n\nParent 1 gives B or b.\n\nParent 2 gives B or b.\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nBlack is dominant, so BB and Bb are black; bb is white. Thus, 75% black, 25% white. That fits the given data perfectly.\n\nSo, if both parents are Bb, the F1 (assuming they self-pollinate) would show the 3:1 ratio. However, the question states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both of which had black coats. So the parents must be able to produce black and possibly white alleles. The 3:1 ratio suggests that the parents are both Bb because when each gives a B, they can produce BB (black), Bb (black), and when one gives B and the other gives b, they produce Bb (black). Only when both give b do they produce bb (white). Thus, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. That makes sense. So the genotype of the parents is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Because they're homozygous for the coat color gene. Wait no, wait. Actually, wait\u2014no, wait. Each animal is diploid, so perhaps the genotype refers to two alleles. But in this case, since coat color is a single gene, each parent can have either the dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele. But wait, the parents themselves are animals, so their genotype must be something like BB or Bb or bb. For example, if one parent is Bb, meaning they have one B and one b allele, then when they mate with another animal, say another Bb, each offspring will get a B from one parent and a b from the other, making their genotype Bb, which means they express the dominant phenotype (black). If both parents are Bb, then each child has a 50% chance of getting B or b, so the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 B and 1/4 b. That matches the given information here because the children are three-quarters black and one-quarter white. So, if both parents are Bb, then all the possible gametes are B, so each child gets B from both parents, hence Bb, which gives black coats. So the parents must be Bb and Bb.\n\nBut wait, let me make sure there aren't any other possibilities. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring would have:\n\nParent 1: BB (genotype B)\nParent 2: Bb (genotype B)\n\nSo each child gets B from the first parent and either B or b from the second. So the children would be BB (if they get B from the second parent) and Bb (if they get b from the second parent). Now, the probability of being BB is 25%, and Bb is 50%. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 black (BB and Bb) and 1/4 white (only Bb). Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then:\n\n- From the BB parent, every gamete is B.\n- From the Bb parent, 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nBB (from B + B) = 50% chance\nBb (from B + b) = 50% chance\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 50% BB (black) and 50% Bb (black), which is 50% black and 50% black, but according to the question, it's 75% black and 25% white. So this doesn't fit. Therefore, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring won't match the required ratio. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, then all offspring would be Bb, resulting in 100% black. Which also doesn't fit. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, as above, the ratio is 50% BB and 50% Bb. So 50% black and 50% black, which is not matching 75% black.

Because if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then each child gets a B from each parent, making their genotype Bb, which leads to 75% B and 25% b.

The possible dihybrid cross scenarios include:\n\n- Both parents are heterozygotes (like Bb \u00d7 Bb): This can lead to various ratios depending on the genes involved.\n- One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb).\n- Or maybe one is homozygous recessive (bb), and the other is heterozygous (Bb).\n\nIn a cross where both parents are Bb, the F1 generation (if considering a single gene) would be 25% B_, 50% _B_, 25% b_ (assuming each parent contributes B or b). But since there are multiple genes, I need to consider if the coat color is mono or dihybrid. However, the problem mentions \"coat color\" without specifying whether it's a single gene or multiple genes. Wait, the problem says \"cross,\" which often refers to two separate genes unless stated otherwise. But the question states \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Hmm, but without knowing the number of genes involved, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe the coat color is a single gene, making the problem simpler. If it's a single gene, then the possible parents would be those that produce a 3:1 ratio. Which combinations produce a 3:1 ratio?\n\nFor a single gene, the parents must be Bb and Bb because their F1 would be 75% B_ and 25% bb. Wait, no\u2014that would give a 3:1 ratio, yes. Because each parent is Bb, so when crossed, the possible gametes are B and b. The Punnett square would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). That gives a 3:1 ratio of B_:bb. But wait, in the problem, the parents have black coats, meaning that the phenotype is black regardless of the genotype. So, in terms of genotypes, the parents could be Bb and Bb (each producing B and b alleles), leading to the 3:1 ratio among the offspring.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are BB and Bb, then the F1 would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But in the case of a single gene, BB would express the dominant trait (black), and bb would express the recessive (white). So the phenotypic ratio would still be 3:1, but the genotypes would vary accordingly.\n\nWait, but the problem doesn't specify if it's a single gene or multiple genes. It just says \"coats\" and asks about the parents' genotypes. Without more information, I should assume it's a single gene scenario, as that makes the problem solvable with the given data. So, proceeding under that assumption.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all white offspring because both parents contribute b, so all the offspring get bb, resulting in 100% white. But the problem says three quarters are black, so this is incorrect. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would also produce all black offspring, since BB is dominant. So both E and D result in all-one phenotype, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio. So they are unlikely.\n\nOptions C and F involve one parent being bb and the other being Bb. Let's see. If one parent is bb (so always produces b) and the other is Bb (producing B and b). Then the F1 would be 50% B_ (BB or Bb) and 50% bb. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (B_ : bb), matching the problem's description. So that seems correct. Now, looking at the genotypes of the parents\u2014since one parent is bb (always produces b) and the other is Bb (which means they can produce B or b). So the parents would be bb (from one parent) and Bb (from the other). So the cross is bb \u00d7 Bb, which matches option C or F. Looking at the options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would indeed produce 50% B_ and 50% bb. Therefore, the parents are bb and Bb.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which we discussed earlier, also producing a 3:1 ratio. So why is option C different? Because in option C, one parent is bb and the other is Bb. In that case, the offspring would be 50% B_ and 50% bb, giving a 3:1 ratio. Similarly, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which results in all black (100% black). Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is all black as well. So, the possible correct answers based on the parents' genotypes would be either option C or D, F, etc., depending on the scenario.\n\nWait, but the question says that the parents themselves had genotype combinations. So, which pair leads to a 3:1 ratio? As per the analysis above, any cross involving one parent as Bb and the other as bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. So, looking at the options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which fits this scenario. So the parents would be Bb and bb, i.e., option C.\n\nAnother way to confirm: the possible genotypes of the parents that result in a 3:1 ratio are Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb. Because:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F1: 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 Phenotype ratio: 3:1 (Black:White)\n- Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 F1: 50% B_, 50% bb \u2192 Phenotype ratio: 3:1 (Black:White)\n\nTherefore, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb would result in the observed phenotypic ratio. Looking at the answer options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, so that would fit. Thus, the parents' genotype was most likely Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option D, or bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option C. Wait, but the options are labeled as single letters, so the possible answers are either C or D.\n\nWait, no\u2014the options are presented as separate choices, so the correct answer would depend on which of the pairs leads to a 3:1 ratio. Since option C is bb \u00d7 Bb and option D is bb \u00d7 bb, both would work. But in reality, the order of the parents doesn't matter in a cross, so either pair would produce the same outcome. However, looking back at the initial setup, the parents are listed as \"two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats.\" So, the parents are both Bb, meaning their genotype would be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option A, but that wouldn't be the case because option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, while option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, now I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents could be Bb and Bb (option A), or one could be Bb and the other bb (option C). But according to our earlier reasoning, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb would produce the required ratio. However, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 3:1 ratio, whereas option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which also does that. So why is option C an option here? Perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, the problem is phrased as the scientist carrying out a cross between two guinea pigs, both with black coats. The parents' genotypes were most likely... So, the parents could be Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb. But looking at the answer options, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb are present as options. Specifically, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So, both of these pairs would result in a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, both A and C would be correct, but in the answer options provided, each choice is a single letter, implying that only one is correct.\n\nWait, but looking back, the question is asking for the most likely genotype combination. So, if both A and C are possible, but in the options, only one is correct, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the parents are both Bb, which is option A, because that would make sense for a single-gene situation, leading to a 3:1 ratio. On the other hand, option C involves one parent being bb, which might suggest that the coat color is polygenic or influenced by multiple genes, but the problem doesn't mention multiple genes, so that complicates things.\n\nGiven the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option A, because it's a standard dihybrid cross scenario. However, I'm not entirely sure, as both A and C seem valid. To resolve this, I'll refer back to the problem statement. It says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Without additional context, such as whether the coat color is influenced by multiple genes or a single gene, it's hard to tell. But typically, problems like this assume a single gene unless stated otherwise.\n\nThus, assuming it's a single gene, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb (option A) or Bb \u00d7 bb (option C). Both would result in a 3:1 ratio. However, since option C includes one parent as bb, which would produce all white, and option A as Bb would produce a mix, neither of which would match the problem's observation of 3:1. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the F1 would be 75% B_ (black) and 25% bb (white). That's exactly the 3:1 ratio. So option A would lead to the correct phenotype ratio. On the other hand, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the F1 would be 50% B_ (black) and 50% bb (white), which is also a 3:1 ratio. So both A and C are correct. However, looking at the answer options, the user may have intended for the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, making option A correct. But wait, the options don't include both A and C; each is a separate choice.\n\nWait, now I realize I misread the options. Let me check again. The options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAh, okay, so both A and C are present. So, if the correct answer is both A and C, but in the context of the options, it's possible that the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is C because one parent is bb, indicating a recessive trait, but I'm not certain. Another approach is to analyze the expected phenotypic ratio based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the F1 will have a 3:1 ratio (75% B_, 25% bb). If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the F1 will be 50% B_ and 50% bb, also a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, both pairs would result in the observed phenotype ratio. Hence, both A and C would be correct, but since the answer requires selecting one letter, perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the problem expects the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is a common setup for such questions. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n\nWait, but looking back, the problem didn't specify anything else, so technically, both A and C are possible. However, in the absence of more context, perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in my reasoning. Let me try another angle. The total number of offspring with black coats is three-quarters, which suggests that the parents must be carriers (Bb) because if they were homozygous (BB), all offspring would be black, and similarly for bb. Therefore, the parents must be carriers (Bb) so that when crossed, they produce a 3:1 ratio. Hence, the correct answer is A. So I think I initially thought it might be C because of the bb parent, but upon reevaluating, the correct answer is A because only Bb \u00d7 Bb would result in the 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD: bb \u00d7 bb  \nE: bb \u00d7 BB  \nF: Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG: Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI: BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ: BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, looking back, I think some of these might be duplicates because they repeat similar pairs.

However, the question asks for the genotype of the parents, not the expected offspring.\n\nBut wait, in this case, if both parents are Bb, then their offspring are indeed Bb, meaning they are all heterozygotes. That makes sense. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nBB (from Bb parent contributing B) and B (from BB parent contributing B): BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, let me correct myself. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring will be:\n\n- From BB parent: always gives B.\n- From Bb parent: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo combining these, the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb\n\nSo the ratio of BB : Bb would be 1:1. But the observed ratio is 3:1, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, then the offspring would be 100% Bb. Because BB can only donate B, and bb can only donate b. So BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Bb. This leads to all black, which contradicts the observation of \u00be black. So that can't be right.\n\nAnother possibility: both parents are Bb. Then as I thought earlier, the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Which corresponds to 3:1 ratio (BB and Bb are black; bb is white). So in this case, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but another possibility: if one parent is Bb and the other is bb. As discussed, that results in all Bb, so all black. Not matching the observation.\n\nWhat if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? That gave us 50% BB and 50% Bb, which is 1:1. Again, not matching the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOr if one parent is BB and the other is BB. Then all offspring would be BB. So that's all black, which also doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. The observed ratio is \u00be black, which is 3/4. So the probability of having at least one dominant allele (black) is 3/4. The only way that happens is if the parents contribute such that there's a 75% chance of getting at least one dominant allele.\n\nWait, in a dihybrid cross, like Aa \u00d7 Aa, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but here we're dealing with a single gene. So for a single gene, the possible outcomes depend on the parents' genotypes. \n\nLet me think differently. The ratio is \u00be black, which is 3 parts, and \u00bc white, which is 1 part. So total parts are 4. Each part represents 25% of the population (since four parts make up 100%). So 3 parts correspond to 75%, which is the presence of at least one dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be such that when crossed, every offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele, i.e., the genotype allows for this. \n\nNow, thinking about possible parent combinations:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed, the offspring are 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 75% BB/Bb (black), 25% bb (white). That fits the observed ratio.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. The offspring would be 25% bb (white), 50% Bb (black), 25% Bb (black). So same as above.\n\nSo both A and C result in 3:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \n\nBoth A and C would lead to the same ratio. But let's see the wording in the question. It asks for the 'genotypes of the parents were most likely'. Both A and C seem possible, but perhaps more than one is correct, but the options don't include multiple letters. Wait, looking back at the original options provided:\n\nThe user listed options from A to J, but some are duplicates. Let me recheck:\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some options repeat. For instance, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as C and E. Similarly, B includes Bb \u00d7 BB, which is same as I and G. And D is bb \u00d7 bb, which is same as J and E.\n\nSo, the unique options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, the way the question is structured, each option seems to present a single pair except for F and others. Actually, looking again, the initial presentation was a bit confusing due to formatting. Maybe it's better to list each unique option once.\n\nAssuming that, let's focus on the possibilities.\n\nFrom our analysis, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in 3:1 ratio. But let's check if any other options could also lead to that ratio.\n\nFor example, option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. As discussed, this would result in all Bb, so all black. That's not the case here.\n\nSimilarly, option E: bb \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be bb (white), so that's not correct.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's compute the offspring. Each parent contributes either B or b. The BB parent can only contribute B. The Bb parent can contribute B or b.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\nBB (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB  \nBB + b = Bb  \n\nSo, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Thus, 50% black (BB and Bb) and 50% white (only Bb). Wait, but the observed ratio is 75% black. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E, same result.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. All offspring would be Bb, so all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the only options that result in 3:1 are A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and C (bb \u00d7 Bb). Are there any other options?\n\nWait, let me double-check option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. That's 100% Bb, so 100% black. No.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. That's mixing different parent types, but the parents involved are BB and Bb. Their offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb, leading to 50% black and 50% white. That's not the case here.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. All offspring would be bb, so all white. No.\n\nSo, going back, the only options that work are A and C. But since the answer should be a single letter, perhaps both A and C are correct, but in the given options, perhaps only one is presented. Wait, looking again, the options are labeled A to J, each representing a pair. So, the question is asking which is the most likely genotype pair. Both A and C would produce the same result, so perhaps both are valid, but the options don't allow selecting multiple letters. Hmm, this might be an issue. Perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, another angle: the parents may have different genotypes. Let's think about the possible cross outcomes.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the cross would yield 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross yields 50% Bb, which is all black. So, that's not the case.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would yield 50% BB and 50% Bb, which is 50% black and 50% white. Also not matching.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring are Bb, so all black. Not matching.\n\nIf both parents are bb, all offspring are bb, all white. Not matching.\n\nThus, the only way to get 3:1 is if both parents are Bb, making the offspring 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. So option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) also produces the same 3:1 ratio. How come? Because in that case, each parent is Bb, so the same outcome occurs regardless of which order the parents are crossed. So, whether you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring are the same. So, both A and C result in the same ratio.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. They are distinct pairs but produce the same outcome. So why are they presented separately?\n\nAh, perhaps because the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype of the parents\", and in reality, both A and C are equally likely, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me verify the calculations once more.\n\nParent 1: Bb  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nPossible gametes from Parent 1: B or b, each 50%.  \nPossible gametes from Parent 2: B or b, each 50%.\n\nCrossing them:\n\n- B (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) = BB (25%)\n- B + b = Bb (50%)\n- b + B = Bb (another 50%, but already counted)\n- b + b = bb (25%)\n\nSo total: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Hence, 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf instead Parent 1 is bb and Parent 2 is Bb:\n\n- bb gametes: always b  \n- Bb gametes: B or b, 50% each  \n\nCrossing:\n\n- b + B = Bb  \n- b + b = bb  \n\nSo, 50% Bb and 50% bb. Ratio 1:1, which is not matching.\n\nWait, no\u2014if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, the ratio is 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So, 1:1, which is 25% black and 75% white. That's the opposite of what's observed.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 50% Bb, which is 75% black, and 50% BB, which is 25% black. Wait, no, 50% Bb would be 75% black because Bb is 50% of the offspring. Wait, no, let me clarify:\n\nWait, the parents are BB and Bb. The possible gametes from BB are always B. Gametes from Bb are B or b, each 50%.\n\nSo, offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB  \n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb  \n\nEach of these is 50% of the offspring. So, 50% BB and 50% Bb. Therefore, the ratio is 50% black (BB and Bb) and 50% white (Bb). Wait, but Bb is black, so that's 100% black. That's conflicting with the observed ratio.\n\nWait, confusion arises because I'm misapplying the concept. When the parents are BB and Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (always B) from BB  \n- Bb (50% from Bb)  \n\nSo, the offspring are 50% BB (black) and 50% Bb (black). Therefore, the entire offspring are black, which contradicts the 75% black ratio observed.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought that when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio was 50% black (from Bb) and 50% white (no, wait\u2014it's the other way around). No, wait, the Bb individual is black, so all offspring would be black, hence 100% black. So that's not matching the observed ratio.\n\nBack to the original point: the only way to get 3:1 is when both parents are Bb. Therefore, the correct answer should be A (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut earlier, I considered that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) also produces the same 3:1 ratio. How is that possible? Let me redo the calculation for option C.\n\nParents: bb \u00d7 Bb  \n\nGametes from bb: b  \nGametes from Bb: B or b  \n\nCrossing:\n\n- b (from bb) + B (from Bb) = Bb  \n- b (from bb) + b (from Bb) = bb  \n\nSo, the offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That's 1:1 ratio, which is not matching the observed 3:1.\n\nWait, that's contradictory. Earlier, I thought that when both parents are Bb, the offspring are 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, resulting in 3:1. Now, when one parent is bb and the other is Bb, the offspring are 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving 1:1. These are two different scenarios, so how can both situations result in 3:1?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me recount.\n\nWhen both parents are Bb:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- BB (25%)  \n- Bb (50%)  \n- bb (25%)  \n\nWhich translates to:\n\nBlack: BB (25%) + Bb (50%) = 75%  \nWhite: bb (25%)  \n\nThus, 3:1 ratio.\n\nWhen one parent is bb and the other is Bb:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- Bb (50%)  \n- bb (50%)  \n\nThus, 50% black, 50% white. Ratio 1:1.\n\nThis means that if both parents are Bb, the ratio is 3:1, while if one is bb and the other is Bb, the ratio is 1:1. Therefore, the correct scenario is when both parents are Bb, leading to 3:1.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut wait, according to my previous analysis, option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) also produces 3:1. That doesn't add up. What am I missing here?\n\nAh, perhaps I need to reconsider the interpretation of the phenotypic ratio. The problem states that three quarters of the offspring have black coats, and one quarter have white. Does that mean 3/4 are black, and 1/4 are white, or 3/4 are black and 1/4 are white together?\n\nYes, it's a ratio of 3:1, which is 3 parts black to 1 part white, totaling 4 parts. Therefore, the parents must produce 3/4 black and 1/4 white offspring.\n\nGiven that, only the parents who produce a 3:1 ratio will fit. So, the only way to achieve 3:1 is when both parents are Bb.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these might be duplicates because some are just pairs of different parents. For example, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as H being BB \u00d7 Bb\u2014these are the same pair of parents, just switched. Similarly, F is Bb \u00d7 bb and E is bb \u00d7 Bb, same thing. So perhaps some of the letters aren't necessary since they represent the same possible parent combinations.\n\nSo, considering that, let me think about what possible parent combinations can lead to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. Since the phenotype is determined by one gene, and the parents are likely heterozygous or homozygous, let me consider the possibilities.\n\nIn a monohybrid cross where both parents are Bb, their offspring will be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, in this case, the parents are crossing, not selfing. Wait no\u2014the question says \"a cross,\" implying between two animals. So, the parents must produce gametes that combine to give those ratios.\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then all offspring would be Bb (since each parent contributes B or b, leading to 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb). But in this problem, the offspring have \u00be black and \u00bc white, which aligns with the 3:1 ratio. However, the question asks for the genotype of the parents, not the expected offspring.\n\nBut wait, in this case, if both parents are Bb, then their offspring are indeed Bb, meaning they are all heterozygotes. That makes sense. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nBB (from Bb parent contributing B) and B (from BB parent contributing B): BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Wait, let me correct myself. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring will be:\n\n- From BB parent: always gives B.\n- From Bb parent: 50% B and 50% b.\n\nSo combining these, the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb\n\nSo the ratio of BB : Bb would be 1:1. But the observed ratio is 3:1, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, then the offspring would be 100% Bb. Because BB can only donate B, and bb can only donate b. So BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 all Bb. This leads to all black, which contradicts the observation of \u00be black. So that can't be right.\n\nAnother possibility: both parents are Bb. Then as I thought earlier, the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Which corresponds to 3:1 ratio (BB and Bb are black; bb is white). So in this case, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which matches option A.\n\nWait, but another possibility: if one parent is Bb and the other is bb. As discussed, that results in all Bb, so all black. Not matching the observation.\n\nWhat if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? That gave us 50% BB and 50% Bb, which is 1:1. Again, not matching the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOr if one parent is BB and the other is BB. Then all offspring would be BB. So that's all black, which also doesn't match.\n\nHmm, maybe another approach. The observed ratio is \u00be black, which is 3/4. So the probability of having at least one dominant allele (black) is 3/4. The only way that happens is if the parents contribute such that there's a 75% chance of getting at least one dominant allele.\n\nWait, in a dihybrid cross, like Aa \u00d7 Aa, the ratio is 9:3:3:1, but here we're dealing with a single gene. So for a single gene, the possible outcomes depend on the parents' genotypes. \n\nLet me think differently. The ratio is \u00be black, which is 3 parts, and \u00bc white, which is 1 part. So total parts are 4. Each part represents 25% of the population (since four parts make up 100%). So 3 parts correspond to 75%, which is the presence of at least one dominant allele.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be such that when crossed, every offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele, i.e., the genotype allows for this. \n\nNow, thinking about possible parent combinations:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed, the offspring are 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 75% BB/Bb (black), 25% bb (white). That fits the observed ratio.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. The offspring would be 25% bb (white), 50% Bb (black), 25% Bb (black). So same as above.\n\nSo both A and C result in 3:1 ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA.

Thus, 50% black (BB and Bb) and 50% white (only Bb). Wait, but the observed ratio is 75% black. So this doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E, same result.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. All offspring would be Bb, so all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo the only options that result in 3:1 are A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and C (bb \u00d7 Bb). Are there any other options?\n\nWait, let me double-check option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. That's 100% Bb, so 100% black. No.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. That's mixing different parent types, but the parents involved are BB and Bb.

Because in that case, each parent is Bb, so the same outcome occurs regardless of which order the parents are crossed. So, whether you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring are the same. So, both A and C result in the same ratio.\n\nHowever, looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. They are distinct pairs but produce the same outcome. So why are they presented separately?\n\nAh, perhaps because the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype of the parents\", and in reality, both A and C are equally likely, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I missed something. Let me verify the calculations once more.\n\nParent 1: Bb  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nPossible gametes from Parent 1: B or b, each 50%.  \nPossible gametes from Parent 2: B or b, each 50%.\n\nCrossing them:\n\n- B (from Parent 1) + B (from Parent 2) = BB (25%)\n- B + b = Bb (50%)\n- b + B = Bb (another 50%, but already counted)\n- b + b = bb (25%)\n\nSo total: BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Hence, 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf instead Parent 1 is bb and Parent 2 is Bb:\n\n- bb gametes: always b  \n- Bb gametes: B or b, 50% each  \n\nCrossing:\n\n- b + B = Bb  \n- b + b = bb  \n\nSo, 50% Bb and 50% bb. Ratio 1:1, which is not matching.\n\nWait, no\u2014if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, the ratio is 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So, 1:1, which is 25% black and 75% white. That's the opposite of what's observed.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 50% Bb, which is 75% black, and 50% BB, which is 25% black. Wait, no, 50% Bb would be 75% black because Bb is 50% of the offspring. Wait, no, let me clarify:\n\nWait, the parents are BB and Bb. The possible gametes from BB are always B. Gametes from Bb are B or b, each 50%.\n\nSo, offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB  \n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb  \n\nEach of these is 50% of the offspring. So, 50% BB and 50% Bb. Therefore, the ratio is 50% black (BB and Bb) and 50% white (Bb). Wait, but Bb is black, so that's 100% black. That's conflicting with the observed ratio.\n\nWait, confusion arises because I'm misapplying the concept. When the parents are BB and Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (always B) from BB  \n- Bb (50% from Bb)  \n\nSo, the offspring are 50% BB (black) and 50% Bb (black). Therefore, the entire offspring are black, which contradicts the 75% black ratio observed.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought that when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio was 50% black (from Bb) and 50% white (no, wait\u2014it's the other way around). No, wait, the Bb individual is black, so all offspring would be black, hence 100% black. So that's not matching the observed ratio.\n\nBack to the original point: the only way to get 3:1 is when both parents are Bb. Therefore, the correct answer should be A (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut earlier, I considered that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) also produces the same 3:1 ratio. How is that possible? Let me redo the calculation for option C.\n\nParents: bb \u00d7 Bb  \n\nGametes from bb: b  \nGametes from Bb: B or b  \n\nCrossing:\n\n- b (from bb) + B (from Bb) = Bb  \n- b (from bb) + b (from Bb) = bb  \n\nSo, the offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That's 1:1 ratio, which is not matching the observed 3:1.\n\nWait, that's contradictory. Earlier, I thought that when both parents are Bb, the offspring are 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, resulting in 3:1. Now, when one parent is bb and the other is Bb, the offspring are 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving 1:1. These are two different scenarios, so how can both situations result in 3:1?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in the first calculation. Let me recount.\n\nWhen both parents are Bb:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- BB (25%)  \n- Bb (50%)  \n- bb (25%)  \n\nWhich translates to:\n\nBlack: BB (25%) + Bb (50%) = 75%  \nWhite: bb (25%)  \n\nThus, 3:1 ratio.\n\nWhen one parent is bb and the other is Bb:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- Bb (50%)  \n- bb (50%)  \n\nThus, 50% black, 50% white. Ratio 1:1.\n\nThis means that if both parents are Bb, the ratio is 3:1, while if one is bb and the other is Bb, the ratio is 1:1. Therefore, the correct scenario is when both parents are Bb, leading to 3:1.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut wait, according to my previous analysis, option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) also produces 3:1. That doesn't add up. What am I missing here?\n\nAh, perhaps I need to reconsider the interpretation of the phenotypic ratio. The problem states that three quarters of the offspring have black coats, and one quarter have white. Does that mean 3/4 are black, and 1/4 are white, or 3/4 are black and 1/4 are white together?\n\nYes, it's a ratio of 3:1, which is 3 parts black to 1 part white, totaling 4 parts. Therefore, the parents must produce 3/4 black and 1/4 white offspring.\n\nGiven that, only the parents who produce a 3:1 ratio will fit. So, the only way to achieve 3:1 is when both parents are Bb.\n\nThus, the correct answer is option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Wait, maybe I need to approach this differently because the answer choices are listed as separate possibilities for the parents' genotype, perhaps implying that the parents themselves are given certain genotypes.\n\nLet me think: If both parents are Bb (heterozygous), then when they cross, what would happen? Each parent can produce gametes with either B or b. The Punnett square for Bb \u00d7 Bb would show four possible outcomes:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1\u2014three individuals with BB (black) and one with bb (white). That matches the problem statement exactly, so the parents must both be heterozygous for that gene. Looking back at the options, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\" and H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". Wait, no, let me check each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 gives 3:1, same as needed.\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Not sure if this makes sense because if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and another is heterozygous (Bb), their cross would give (BB x Bb) = BB, Bb, Bb, bb. Phenotype-wise, BB (black) occurs 25%, Bb (black) 50%, and bb (white) 25%. So the ratio is 3:1, same as required. But wait, does this fit any of the parents? Because the first parent is BB and the second is Bb. So the parents involved are BB and Bb. So the possible answers include such cases. However, let me see the options more clearly.\n\nLooking again at the options provided, the user lists them as pairs, but some are individual parent combinations. For example, option F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", which would yield 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white)\u2014so 3:1. Alternatively, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\"\u2014same as above, resulting in 3:1. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\"\u2014same as well. Option D is \"bb \u00d7 bb\"\u2014which would produce all black, 100% BB. Option J is \"BB \u00d7 BB\"\u2014only BB, 100% black. Option A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\"\u2014again, 3:1. Option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\"\u2014this seems like an option where there are multiple crosses happening simultaneously, but in reality, the problem states a single cross between two guinea pigs, meaning the parents are a pair. Therefore, in the context of the problem, the correct parents should be a pair who produce a 3:1 ratio, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb, BB \u00d7 Bb, bb \u00d7 Bb, etc., but looking at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So both G and H involve a parent being Bb and another being BB or vice versa. But since the problem specifies that the parents are a pair, any of these combinations would work. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype,\" so we need to determine which pair produces the observed ratio without any extra information.\n\nAlternatively, thinking about the possible genetic crosses:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb: 3:1\n- BB \u00d7 Bb: 3:1\n- bb \u00d7 Bb: 3:1\n\nSo all these combinations would lead to the desired ratio. Now, looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; option G is Bb \u00d7 BB; option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. All these are valid. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype. Since all these produce the same ratio, the specific parents don't change the ratio. But perhaps the way the parents are set up affects the outcome. Hmm, but all these pairs produce the same phenotypic ratio regardless of the order of alleles. So perhaps the answer depends on whether the parents are both heterozygotes (like option G) or one is homozygous dominant and the other heterozygous (options A or B).\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify anything else about the parents beyond their genotypes. So technically, any of these combinations would result in the 3:1 ratio. However, among the options provided, which ones represent a viable cross leading to the observed phenotype?\n\nWait, looking back at the options, I realize that some of them may not make sense. For instance, option D is \"bb \u00d7 bb\"\u2014that's a cross between two homozygous recessive, which would result in all black, not the observed ratio. Similarly, option J is \"BB \u00d7 BB\"\u2014all black. Option F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\"\u2014that would also result in 3:1, as discussed earlier. So the possible correct parents are those where one is Bb and the other is Bb (option A), or one is BB and the other is Bb (option B), or one is bb and the other is Bb (option F). But according to the options given, the correct answer would be either A, B, F, G, H, or others based on the pairing.\n\nHowever, the question states that the scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both with black coats. So both parents are at least homozygous for the black allele. Let's consider each option:\n\n- Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Both parents are heterozygous, producing 3:1 ratio.\n- Option B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 One pair is homozygous dominant, and the other pair includes a heterozygote. Their combined effect would still produce 3:1 ratio, as shown before.\n- Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Same as option B, results in 3:1.\n- Option G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Same as option A.\n- Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Same as option A.\n\nOptions C and E are similar to A and B respectively.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that the parents are both black-coated. So any of the parents being BB or Bb would satisfy this condition. So all the options except D and J are possible. But in the given options, the possible correct parents are any pair that results in a 3:1 ratio. Among the options, A, B, F, G, H, I, J\u2014all are possible, but the question asks for the most likely genotype, which refers to the possible genotype pairings that lead to the observed ratio. But the question is framed as \"the most likely genotype\", which probably refers to a specific pair rather than multiple pairs. Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Perhaps the intended answer is that both parents are Bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G.\n\nAlternatively, considering that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the answer would be G. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, that's option H, but that wouldn't affect the ratio. Wait, no\u2014the cross remains the same.

Therefore, only one pair of parents is involved.\n\nSo, now I need to focus on the remaining options: A, C, D, E, G, I, J. Let's analyze each possibility.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. If both parents are heterozygotes (Bb), then the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1, right? Because each gamete will give either B or b. So, four possible combinations when crossed:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nSince B is dominant, BB and Bb will express black, and bb will express white. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are both Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b in equal amounts. So, the Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Therefore, 75% black (BB + Bb = 75%) and 25% white (bb). That matches the data here. So, this looks promising as an answer.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), meaning they'll always pass on the recessive allele (b). The other parent is heterozygous (Bb), so they can produce B or b. When crossed, the possible offspring will be:\n\n- Bb: 50% (from Bb \u00d7 bb)\n- bb: 50% (from bb \u00d7 bb)\n\nBut wait, since bb is homozygous recessive, any offspring inheriting 'b' from the bb parent will have the phenotype. However, in this case, the bb parent can only pass 'b', so all offspring will inherit 'b' from the bb parent and either 'B' or 'b' from the Bb parent. So, half will be Bb (phenotype determined by B being dominant) and half will be bb. But according to the problem, 75% are black and 25% are white. That wouldn't fit because the offspring would only have Bb and bb, giving a 50% black and 50% white ratio. So, this option doesn't match the observed ratio.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive. They can only produce bb gametes. So, all offspring would be bb, which means all would have white coats. This would give a 100% white coat ratio, which contradicts the given 75% black and 25% white. So, this option is wrong.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is homozygous recessive (bb), producing only 'b' gametes. The other parent is homozygous dominant (BB), producing only 'B' gametes. So, all offspring would be Bb, leading to all black coats. Again, this gives a 100% black coat ratio, which doesn't match the given data.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option E. BB provides only 'B' gametes, and Bb provides 'B' or 'b'. All offspring would get 'B' from BB and either 'B' or 'b' from Bb, resulting in Bb. So, all black. Doesn't match.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), providing 'B' gametes. The other is homozygous recessive (bb), providing 'b' gametes. All offspring will be Bb, leading to all black. Again, 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant (BB). They can only produce 'B' gametes. So, all offspring will be BB, hence all black. No match.\n\nGoing back to option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb produces a 3:1 ratio\u201475% black, 25% white. That fits perfectly with the given data. So, the correct answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.

BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\", while others have more combinations. Hmm, maybe some of these are incorrect because each parent can only be a single genotype, not multiple. Looking back, perhaps some options like B and F are redundant because they describe two different parents' combinations rather than the actual single parent's genotype. For example, option B lists two pairs of parents: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, which doesn't make sense because there should be only one pair of parents crossing. Similarly, option F describes another possible pairing. That seems off. So, probably, options B and F aren't correct because they suggest combining multiple parents into pairs, whereas the problem states that the scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs. Therefore, only one pair of parents is involved.\n\nSo, now I need to focus on the remaining options: A, C, D, E, G, I, J. Let's analyze each possibility.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.

But wait, three-quarters and one-quarter don't fit neatly into typical Mendelian ratios like 9:3:3:1, unless there's something else going on. Hmm, maybe it's a case where one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Because when you cross bb with Bb, all the offspring will get one b from the bb parent and one B from the Bb parent. So their genotype would be Bb, and since B is dominant, all offspring would express black coat color. Wait, no\u2014that wouldn't explain the 3:1 ratio. If both parents are Bb, then the cross would give a 25% chance of Bb (black) and 75% chance of BB (also black). That still doesn't account for the 3:1 split. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would yield 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (brown?), but wait, the problem says black is dominant over white. Oh, right! So in reality, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the offspring would have a 50% chance of being BB (black) and 50% chance of being Bb (which is brown, but since the question states black is dominant, maybe it's considered black as well\u2014wait, no, that's confusing. Wait, if the other parent is Bb, then the offspring would have a 50% chance of being BB and 50% Bb. But in the problem, the white coat appears in 25%, so that doesn't fit. Alternatively, if both parents are Bb, then the cross would yield 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (brown), and 25% bb (white). But the problem shows three quarters black and one quarter white, which matches this. So that seems correct.\n\nBut wait, the options include whether the parents are Bb x Bb or BB x Bb. Option G is Bb x BB. Let me check that. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the offspring would be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% BB (black). Again, that gives 50-50, not 75-25.

So that would correspond to option G: Bb x Bb.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that if both parents are Bb, the offspring would have 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem's description.

So any option where the parents are bb \u00d7 something else would eliminate it as a possible answer. Looking at the options:\n\n- D is bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 both parents produce only bb, so all offspring would be bb. That's a 100% white coat. Not matching.\n- F is Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Parents can produce Bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb), and bb. Wait, no, let me think again. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would be Bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb): the father gives B or b. The mother gives b. So all offspring would be Bb. Because Bb is dominant, they'll all express black. So this would result in 100% black. But our case is 75% black and 25% white, so F can't be correct.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Bb is Bb (dominant), BB is homozygous dominant. When Bb mates with BB, all offspring will be Bb. So same as F, all black. Not applicable.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Here, the bb parent cannot contribute B; they give b. The BB parent gives B. All offspring would be Bb, hence all black. Again, not matching.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb.

So when Bb (hetero) crosses with BB (homo), the offspring will receive either B from BB or B from Bb. So all offspring will be Bb. Hence, 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. So BB (homo) and bb (hetero). When they mate, all offspring will be Bb (since B from BB and b from bb). Again, 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are BB. They can only produce B. So all offspring are BB, which is all black. So 100% black. Not matching.\n\nThat leaves us with option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. Each parent is heterozygous for the coat color. Let's analyze their offspring. In a dihybrid cross, but here it's monohybrid. For a single gene with two alleles (B and b), where B is dominant and b is recessive, crossing two Bb parents. The possible gametes are B and b.

But let's see.\n\nFirst, since both parents are producing black-coated animals, they must not be homozygous recessive (bb), otherwise, some of their offspring would be bb (white). So any option where the parents are bb \u00d7 something else would eliminate it as a possible answer. Looking at the options:\n\n- D is bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 both parents produce only bb, so all offspring would be bb. That's a 100% white coat. Not matching.\n- F is Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Parents can produce Bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb), and bb. Wait, no, let me think again. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would be Bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb): the father gives B or b. The mother gives b. So all offspring would be Bb. Because Bb is dominant, they'll all express black. So this would result in 100% black. But our case is 75% black and 25% white, so F can't be correct.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Bb is Bb (dominant), BB is homozygous dominant. When Bb mates with BB, all offspring will be Bb. So same as F, all black. Not applicable.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Here, the bb parent cannot contribute B; they give b. The BB parent gives B. All offspring would be Bb, hence all black. Again, not matching.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So the bb parent gives b, the Bb parent can give B or b. So half the offspring would be Bb (black), half would be bb (white). So 50% black and 50% white. But our case is 75% black and 25% white. So that doesn't fit.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both parents are Bb and BB. Wait, BB is homozygous dominant, and Bb is heterozygous. So when Bb (hetero) crosses with BB (homo), the offspring will receive either B from BB or B from Bb. So all offspring will be Bb. Hence, 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. So BB (homo) and bb (hetero). When they mate, all offspring will be Bb (since B from BB and b from bb). Again, 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are BB. They can only produce B. So all offspring are BB, which is all black. So 100% black. Not matching.\n\nThat leaves us with option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. Each parent is heterozygous for the coat color. Let's analyze their offspring. In a dihybrid cross, but here it's monohybrid. For a single gene with two alleles (B and b), where B is dominant and b is recessive, crossing two Bb parents. The possible gametes are B and b. So the Punnett square would show four possibilities:\n\n- B \u00d7 B = BB (black)\n- B \u00d7 b = Bb (black)\n- b \u00d7 B = Bb (black)\n- b \u00d7 b = bb (white)\n\nSo the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1\u2014three times black and once white. That matches exactly what the problem states. Therefore, the correct genotype for the parents is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

That means neither parent can be homozygous recessive (bb). Because if one parent was bb, then any offspring from that parent would definitely be bb, resulting in white coats. But here, all offspring are black, including 75%, so no parent has bb as genotype. Therefore, both parents must carry at least one dominant allele. So their genotypes cannot be bb.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2013 Well, one parent is bb, which would make all offspring bb, so white coats.

So that fits because all 100% would be black. Wait, but the offspring in the problem had 75% black and 25% white. So this seems contradictory unless the parents are Bb and something else.\n\nWait, another approach: The expected phenotypic ratio when parents are Bb and Bb is a 3:1 ratio, which matches the problem's \u00be black and \u00bc white. So that would suggest that both parents are Bb, making option H correct? Wait, checking the options: Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Oh wait, that's different.

So if both parents are Bb, then the F1 generation would have 50% B_ (black) and 50% bb (white), giving a 1:1 ratio, which contradicts the 3:1 observed ratio. Therefore, the parents can't both be Bb because that wouldn't lead to the required 3:1 ratio. So maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's re-examine.\n\nThe observed ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. This suggests a 3:1 ratio, which typically occurs when one parent is homozygous dominant (e.g., BB) and the other is heterozygous (e.g., Bb). Because when you cross BB (homozygous dominant) with Bb (heterozygous), the offspring will always get B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent.

So that would imply that option H is correct? But let me check the options again.\n\nWait, no\u2014option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the F1 would receive either B from BB or B from Bb. And the Bb parent would contribute B or b. So all offspring would be B_, which is black.

Because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then F1 would be 100% B_. Which is conflicting. Therefore, option H is not correct.\n\nWait, the options are A to J.

But the question is about the parents, not the F1. So if both parents are Bb, then the answer would be option H, but I thought option H wasn't correct. Wait, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So if both parents are Bb, then the F1 would be 3:1. So the parents themselves must be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option H. But according to my analysis, the F1 ratio is correct with option H, but the parents also need to be Bb \u00d7 Bb. So the correct answer would be H. But wait, in the initial consideration, I thought H would be correct, but perhaps the confusion arises because the F1 is 3:1 regardless of whether the parents are both Bb. Wait, no\u2014parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce a 3:1 ratio, while parents being BB \u00d7 Bb would produce a 100% black ratio.

Let me think about how the F1 generation would look based on different parent pairs.\n\nFirst, since black is dominant, any animal with at least one B (dominant allele) will have black coat color. Only when an individual has two b alleles (bb) will they have white coat color. The observed ratio is 3:1, which is typical for a heterozygous parent crossed with another heterozygote because each parent can give either B or b. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then each parent can contribute B or b. The possible gametes are B and b, each with equal probability. So, the Punnett square would show four possibilities:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo, the ratios would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That gives us a 3:1 ratio of brown to blue (assuming B is brown and b is blue). But wait, in the problem, the coat color is black dominant over white, so maybe the letters correspond differently. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio as well. So, if both parents are Bb, their F1 would also have a 3:1 ratio. That seems consistent with the problem statement where \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. \n\nLet me check the other options just to make sure there aren't other possibilities. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (which means all recessive, so white coat) and the other is Bb (heterozygous, so can give B or b), the F1 would be:\n\nFrom bb:\n- All bb (white)\n\nFrom Bb:\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 50% bb (white)\n\nSo the ratio would be 25% bb (white), 25% Bb (brown), and 50% bb (white). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F1 would be:\n\nEach parent contributes once, so the possible gametes are:\n\nFrom bb: only b\nFrom Bb: B and b\n\nSo the offspring would be:\n\n- From b and B: Bb (brown)\n- From b and b: bb (white)\n\nBut since each parent can produce multiple gametes, the Punnett square would have:\n\n- Bb (from B and b): 50%\n- bb (from b and b): 50%\n\nTherefore, the ratio would be 50% brown (Bb) and 50% white (bb). That doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio. So option C wouldn't work here.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see: BB is homozygous dominant, and Bb is heterozygous. So the F1 would be:\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- BB: B\n- Bb: B and b\n\nThe Punnett square would be:\n\n- B (from BB) x B (from BB): BB (brown)\n- B (from BB) x b (from Bb): Bb (brown)\n- b (from Bb) x B (from BB): Bb (brown)\n- b (from Bb) x b (from Bb): bb (white)\n\nSo the ratio would be 75% brown and 25% white, which matches the given data. However, wait\u2014the parents themselves are BB and Bb. So the question is about the genotype of the parents. So the parents are BB and Bb. But let me check if any other options fit better.\n\nAnother possibility is option H: BB \u00d7 Bb. As above, this leads to 75% brown and 25% white, which fits the data. So that's another valid option.\n\nLooking back, option D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb (white). That contradicts the given \u00be black and \u00bc white, so option D is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. This would lead to all offspring being Bb (brown), same as option G. So option E is similar to G.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Then all offspring would be BB (brown), which is not matching the data.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Then the F1 would be Bb (brown) and bb (white), same as option G. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, that's option A. Or if they're BB \u00d7 Bb, that's option E or G. Or if they're bb \u00d7 Bb, that's option C, but that didn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which works. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which also works. And option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo the question is, which pair of parents would produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio? Well, any pair where one parent is homozygous dominant (like Bb or BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb) would result in a 3:1 ratio. Because the possible offspring genotypes would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Therefore, the phenotypes would be brown (BB and Bb) and white (bb).\n\nSo among the options, any pair where one parent is Bb and the other is Bb would fit. Looking at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; option E is bb \u00d7 BB; option G is Bb \u00d7 BB; option H is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nAll of these would result in a 3:1 ratio. Now, the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. The key point is whether the parents are both heterozygotes or one is homozygous dominant and the other is heterozygous. \n\nIn the case of option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb), both parents are heterozygous, which is a common scenario. In option E (bb \u00d7 BB), one is homozygous recessive and the other is heterozygous. Similarly, option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) is the same as E but reversed. Option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) is the same as option A but reversed. So, all these options are equally likely in producing the 3:1 ratio. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype of the parents.\" It depends on whether the parents are both heterozygous or one is homozygous. But without additional information, all of these are possible. However, looking back, the answer choices include both A and H, which are the same in terms of the ratio produced, but they represent different parent types. \n\nWait, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, implying that perhaps one of these configurations is more probable than the others. But without knowing anything else, all these configurations are possible. However, in reality, the 3:1 ratio is typically seen when one parent is homozygous dominant and the other is heterozygous, making the parents Bb and Bb. Because if one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would inherit bb from the homozygous parent, resulting in 100% white coats. So, in that case, the parents cannot be both Bb and bb, because that would lead to a different outcome.\n\nThus, the correct answer must involve both parents being heterozygous, i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb. That's option A. Alternatively, option H is also correct, but since the question allows only a single letter, and both A and H are correct, but the way the options are presented, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it represents both parents contributing heterozygous genes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option H says \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" but some of the others might be more straightforward. Hmm. Let me think about how the F1 generation would look based on different parent pairs.\n\nFirst, since black is dominant, any animal with at least one B (dominant allele) will have black coat color. Only when an individual has two b alleles (bb) will they have white coat color. The observed ratio is 3:1, which is typical for a heterozygous parent crossed with another heterozygote because each parent can give either B or b. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then each parent can contribute B or b. The possible gametes are B and b, each with equal probability. So, the Punnett square would show four possibilities:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo, the ratios would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That gives us a 3:1 ratio of brown to blue (assuming B is brown and b is blue). But wait, in the problem, the coat color is black dominant over white, so maybe the letters correspond differently. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio as well. So, if both parents are Bb, their F1 would also have a 3:1 ratio. That seems consistent with the problem statement where \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. \n\nLet me check the other options just to make sure there aren't other possibilities. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (which means all recessive, so white coat) and the other is Bb (heterozygous, so can give B or b), the F1 would be:\n\nFrom bb:\n- All bb (white)\n\nFrom Bb:\n- 50% Bb (brown)\n- 50% bb (white)\n\nSo the ratio would be 25% bb (white), 25% Bb (brown), and 50% bb (white). Wait, no, that's not right. Actually, the F1 would be:\n\nEach parent contributes once, so the possible gametes are:\n\nFrom bb: only b\nFrom Bb: B and b\n\nSo the offspring would be:\n\n- From b and B: Bb (brown)\n- From b and b: bb (white)\n\nBut since each parent can produce multiple gametes, the Punnett square would have:\n\n- Bb (from B and b): 50%\n- bb (from b and b): 50%\n\nTherefore, the ratio would be 50% brown (Bb) and 50% white (bb). That doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio. So option C wouldn't work here.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see: BB is homozygous dominant, and Bb is heterozygous. So the F1 would be:\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- BB: B\n- Bb: B and b\n\nThe Punnett square would be:\n\n- B (from BB) x B (from BB): BB (brown)\n- B (from BB) x b (from Bb): Bb (brown)\n- b (from Bb) x B (from BB): Bb (brown)\n- b (from Bb) x b (from Bb): bb (white)\n\nSo the ratio would be 75% brown and 25% white, which matches the given data. However, wait\u2014the parents themselves are BB and Bb. So the question is about the genotype of the parents. So the parents are BB and Bb. But let me check if any other options fit better.\n\nAnother possibility is option H: BB \u00d7 Bb. As above, this leads to 75% brown and 25% white, which fits the data. So that's another valid option.\n\nLooking back, option D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb (white).

Then the F1 would be Bb (brown) and bb (white), same as option G. So that's correct.\n\nWait, but the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, that's option A. Or if they're BB \u00d7 Bb, that's option E or G. Or if they're bb \u00d7 Bb, that's option C, but that didn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which works. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which also works. And option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo the question is, which pair of parents would produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio? Well, any pair where one parent is homozygous dominant (like Bb or BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb) would result in a 3:1 ratio.

For example, if a parent was homozygous recessive (bb), they would definitely express the recessive phenotype, which here is white. But since both parents have black, some of them must be heterozygotes (Bb). Because if they were homozygous dominant (BB), then all their offspring would also be BB, resulting in 100% black, which doesn't match the 75-25 ratio.\n\nNow, looking at the possible combinations:\n\nOption A: Both parents are Bb. That makes sense because when you cross two Bb parents, you get a 25% chance for each genotype in the F1 generation (BB, Bb, Bb, bb), leading to phenotypic ratios of 3:1 (75% black, 25% white).\n\nOption C: One parent is bb and the other is Bb. If you cross bb (which gives all b alleles) with Bb (which can give B or b), the F1 would be Bb (since bb is recessive). Wait, no\u2014if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, crossing them would result in all offspring being Bb, because bb is recessive and will mask the B allele. So all offspring would be Bb, meaning all black. That doesn't fit the observed 3:1 ratio because all would have black, not three parts black and one part white.\n\nWait, hold on\u2014am I mixing up something here? Let me think again. If one parent is bb and the other is Bb, then the offspring would all inherit one b allele (from bb) and one B allele (from Bb). So the genotype would be Bb for all, making all the offspring black. Therefore, option C wouldn't produce the correct ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Option D: Both parents are bb. Then all their offspring would be bb, hence all black. Again, that's 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: Parent 1 is bb and Parent 2 is BB. Crossing them would result in all offspring being Bb (since bb + BB = Bb).

So if both parents are Bb, that's a possible answer. Now, looking at the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems correct. However, I need to check if any other options might also lead to a 3:1 ratio. For instance, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, what happens?\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb: All offspring will be BB or Bb, right? Because BB can only donate B, and Bb can donate B or b. So all offspring would get at least one B, meaning all black. That gives a 100% black ratio, which doesn't fit our data. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb, resulting in 100% black. Not matching.\n\nWhat if one parent is BB and the other is BB? Then all offspring would be BB, giving 100% black. Again, not matching.\n\nIf both parents are BB, same as above.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is bb, same as before. Only when both parents are Bb does the cross produce a 3:1 ratio.\n\nAnother possibility: What if one parent is Bb and the other is bb? Let's see. Bb \u00d7 bb: Each parent can contribute B or b. So offspring would be Bb (from Bb) or bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb). Wait, no: Bb (parent 1) can produce B and b; bb (parent 2) can only produce b. So combining, the possibilities are Bb (from Bb \u00d7 b) and bb (from b \u00d7 b). So the offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Which is a 1:1 ratio, but we have a 3:1 ratio. So this doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, that's correct. Another thought: Are there any other combinations that could give a 3:1 ratio? Like if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, but earlier analysis shows that leads to 100% black.\n\nWait, another angle: Could the parents be Bb and Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio, making A the correct answer. But let me double-check the options provided. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is similar to A, but perhaps the order is different. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both Bb in option A and BB in option G, which aren't the same genotype. So option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct.\n\nBut wait, looking back, I just realized that in the initial question, the parents are both guinea pigs, each with black coats. So their genotypes must produce a mixture where some have black and some have white. So if both parents are Bb, their offspring would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white. That fits perfectly. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.

BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these are a bit confusing because option F says BB \u00d7 bb, while others mix different combinations. But since the parents are presumably both contributing to the same gene, maybe they're both heterozygous? Or perhaps one is homozygous recessive and the other is heterozygous.\n\nLet me think about possible parent combinations. If both parents are Bb, then their cross should give a 3:1 ratio. Let's see: Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce four gametes\u2014BB, Bb, Bb, bb\u2014with frequencies 25%, 50%, 50%, and 25%. When these combine, the Punnett square would show:\n\n- BB (25%): black\n- Bb (50%): black\n- bb (25%): white\n\nSo indeed, 75% black and 25% white. That matches the observed ratio here.

Let me think about possible scenarios. If the parents are both Bb (heterozygous), then when they cross, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 3:1, right? Because each parent can produce B and b alleles. So, Bb \u00d7 Bb would result in four possible gametes: B, B, b, b. When combining, the Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. But since black is dominant, those would express as BB (black), Bb (black), and bb (white). So the ratio would be 3/4 black, 1/4 white, which matches the problem description perfectly. That means the parents must be Bb and Bb, making option G correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check another possibility. What if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? Then the possible gametes would be B from BB and B from Bb, and b from Bb. So, the offspring would get B from the first parent and either B or b from the second. So, the possibilities would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Again, the phenotype ratio would be 3:1. Wait, no\u2014the parents here are BB and Bb. If one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), then their offspring would have a 75% chance of being BB (which shows black) and a 25% chance of being Bb (also showing black because B is dominant). Wait, but in this case, does the white coat even appear? No, because in this case, all the offspring would be either BB or Bb. So why does the problem say there are \u00be black and \u00bc white? Maybe I got confused earlier.\n\nLet me clarify: the problem states that the offspring have \u00be black and \u00bc white. So, in this scenario where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the children would all exhibit black coat color, not white. Therefore, the observed ratio doesn't fit because we don't see any white coats. So this scenario wouldn't work.\n\nAnother possibility is if both parents are Bb, leading to the same outcome as before\u2014three black and one white. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the children are BB (25%) and Bb (75%), so 75% black, matching the problem. However, in this case, the white coat wouldn't be present, so the answer might be different. Hmm, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nWait, the original question says that the parents' genotypes were \"most likely\" among the options provided. So, based on the cross resulting in \u00be black and \u00bc white, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. That gives exactly the 3:1 ratio needed. Another possibility is if one parent is BB and the other is bb. Then, the offspring would all be Bb, which would all show black, giving 100% black coats, which doesn't match the problem statement. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the children would still be 75% black and 25% Bb, which also results in 75% black, 25% Bb (so 25% would show black if B is dominant, meaning 100% black). Wait, that's conflicting. Let me double-check: if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB: B and B,\nFrom Bb: B and b.\n\nSo, combining, the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (from Bb x BB)\n\nWait, actually, each parent produces gametes, so the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- From BB (parent 1): B\n- From Bb (parent 2): B and b.\n\nSo, the possible gametes are B and b, each with equal probability. When combined, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from B + B)\n- Bb (from B + b)\n- Bb (from b + B)\n- bb (from b + b).\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be BB (black), Bb (black), and bb (white). Thus, 3/4 black, 1/4 white, which fits the problem. Now, in this scenario, the parents are BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous). So, the parents' genotypes would be BB and Bb. Looking back at the options, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, and option I is BB \u00d7 bb. Option E would result in 75% black and 25% white, but in our scenario, the parents are BB and Bb, which is option E's reverse. Wait, no: option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all Bb offspring (since one parent is bb and the other is BB; their gametes would combine to give Bb for all offspring). So, all would be Bb, hence all black, which doesn't fit the problem. Whereas option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would result in all Bb, hence all black again. Wait, but in our scenario, the parents are BB and Bb, which leads to a 75% black and 25% Bb. So, how does this compare?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nIf the parents are BB and Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- From BB: B\n- From Bb: B and b.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) = Bb\n- b (from Bb) + b (from BB) = bb.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nTherefore, the ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, which matches the problem. So, the parents' genotypes are BB and Bb. Looking back at the options, option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would result in all Bb, hence all black, which doesn't fit. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all Bb, hence all black. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would result in 75% black and 25% Bb, same as our current scenario. Wait, but in F, the parents are Bb and bb, leading to \u00be black and \u00bc white, just like our initial analysis when parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. So, both F and G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in \u00be black and \u00bc white. But according to the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb and G is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused because initially, I thought the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but now I realize that Bb \u00d7 bb would also result in \u00be black and \u00bc white. So, both F and G would yield the desired ratio. But the question asks for the most likely genotype pair. Are both F and G possible? Or did I make an error somewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the cross. Let me redo the cross for Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the possible gametes are B and b, each with a 50% chance. Combining, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B + B = BB\n- B + b = Bb\n- b + B = Bb\n- b + b = bb\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nThus, the ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, matching the problem. So, both F (Bb \u00d7 bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in the correct ratio. But looking back at the options, both F and G are listed. However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair. So, perhaps both are equally likely, but since the options include both F and G, and the question asks for the most likely, perhaps F is more likely than G because in G, both parents are Bb, whereas in F, one is Bb and the other is bb. Wait, no\u2014in fact, whether the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb affects the outcome. Let me think again.\n\nIn reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the offspring will always be \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, hence \u00be black and \u00bc white. However, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring will be \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as above. So both F and G would result in the correct ratio. But wait, in F, the parents are Bb and bb, while in G, they are Bb and Bb. So, which is more probable? Well, the cross Bb \u00d7 bb would require one parent to be Bb and the other to be bb. The cross Bb \u00d7 Bb would require both parents to be Bb. So, which cross is more likely? It depends on the availability of the genotypes in the population. For example, if both parents are Bb, then G would occur. If one is Bb and the other is bb, then F would occur. But without knowing the frequencies of Bb and bb in the population, it's hard to say which is more common. However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair, regardless of the parents' origin. So, both F and G could be possible answers, but the question lists them separately. So, I need to see which one is listed as an option.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nBoth F and G result in the correct ratio, so both would satisfy the condition. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype pair,\" implying that one of them is more probable than the other. But without additional information, both pairs are possible outcomes of such a cross. So, perhaps I need to consider which pair leads to the observed ratio. Both do, so maybe the question expects us to choose the pair that results in the observed ratio, regardless of how often it occurs in nature. Alternatively, perhaps the parents' genotype pair is unique, but in reality, multiple pairs can lead to the same ratio.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not possible. Only specific pairs would lead to the same ratio. Let me think: If both parents are Bb, then the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, which is \u00be black and \u00bc white. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as above. So, both F and G lead to the same ratio. So, perhaps the answer includes both, but in the options, they are separate. So, perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb), assuming that the parents are both Bb. Alternatively, some textbooks may prefer that the parents are both Bb, leading to the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you have a cross where one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as when both are Bb. So, both cases result in the same ratio, but the pairs are different. Therefore, depending on which pair is used, the answer changes. But since the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair, perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb), as it implies that both parents are Bb, which might be more realistic in some contexts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are Bb, making the correct answer G. But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to approach this is to consider the Punnett square for each possible pair. As I did earlier, when both parents are Bb, the Punnett square yields \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, which is the desired ratio. When one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the Punnett square also yields \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. So, both F and G lead to the correct ratio. Therefore, both pairs are possible, but the question asks for the most likely. Without more context, it's ambiguous, but in many problems, the assumption is that both parents are Bb, making G the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, all would be Bb, hence all black, which doesn't fit the problem. Whereas option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would result in all Bb, hence all black again. Wait, but in our scenario, the parents are BB and Bb, which leads to a 75% black and 25% Bb. So, how does this compare?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-express this.\n\nIf the parents are BB and Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- From BB: B\n- From Bb: B and b.\n\nSo, the possible combinations are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) = Bb\n- b (from Bb) + b (from BB) = bb.\n\nThus, the possible phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nTherefore, the ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, which matches the problem. So, the parents' genotypes are BB and Bb. Looking back at the options, option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would result in all Bb, hence all black, which doesn't fit. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all Bb, hence all black. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would result in 75% black and 25% Bb, same as our current scenario. Wait, but in F, the parents are Bb and bb, leading to \u00be black and \u00bc white, just like our initial analysis when parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. So, both F and G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in \u00be black and \u00bc white. But according to the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb and G is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, now I'm getting confused because initially, I thought the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but now I realize that Bb \u00d7 bb would also result in \u00be black and \u00bc white. So, both F and G would yield the desired ratio. But the question asks for the most likely genotype pair. Are both F and G possible? Or did I make an error somewhere?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I misapplied the cross. Let me redo the cross for Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the possible gametes are B and b, each with a 50% chance. Combining, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B + B = BB\n- B + b = Bb\n- b + B = Bb\n- b + b = bb\n\nSo, the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nThus, the ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white, matching the problem. So, both F (Bb \u00d7 bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would result in the correct ratio. But looking back at the options, both F and G are listed. However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair. So, perhaps both are equally likely, but since the options include both F and G, and the question asks for the most likely, perhaps F is more likely than G because in G, both parents are Bb, whereas in F, one is Bb and the other is bb. Wait, no\u2014in fact, whether the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb affects the outcome. Let me think again.\n\nIn reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the offspring will always be \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, hence \u00be black and \u00bc white. However, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring will be \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as above. So both F and G would result in the correct ratio. But wait, in F, the parents are Bb and bb, while in G, they are Bb and Bb. So, which is more probable? Well, the cross Bb \u00d7 bb would require one parent to be Bb and the other to be bb. The cross Bb \u00d7 Bb would require both parents to be Bb. So, which cross is more likely? It depends on the availability of the genotypes in the population. For example, if both parents are Bb, then G would occur. If one is Bb and the other is bb, then F would occur. But without knowing the frequencies of Bb and bb in the population, it's hard to say which is more common. However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair, regardless of the parents' origin. So, both F and G could be possible answers, but the question lists them separately. So, I need to see which one is listed as an option.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nBoth F and G result in the correct ratio, so both would satisfy the condition. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype pair,\" implying that one of them is more probable than the other. But without additional information, both pairs are possible outcomes of such a cross. So, perhaps I need to consider which pair leads to the observed ratio. Both do, so maybe the question expects us to choose the pair that results in the observed ratio, regardless of how often it occurs in nature. Alternatively, perhaps the parents' genotype pair is unique, but in reality, multiple pairs can lead to the same ratio.\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not possible. Only specific pairs would lead to the same ratio. Let me think: If both parents are Bb, then the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, which is \u00be black and \u00bc white. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as above. So, both F and G lead to the same ratio. So, perhaps the answer includes both, but in the options, they are separate. So, perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb), assuming that the parents are both Bb. Alternatively, some textbooks may prefer that the parents are both Bb, leading to the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. \n\nWait, but in reality, when you have a cross where one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as when both are Bb. So, both cases result in the same ratio, but the pairs are different. Therefore, depending on which pair is used, the answer changes. But since the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair, perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb), as it implies that both parents are Bb, which might be more realistic in some contexts.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are Bb, making the correct answer G. But I'm not entirely sure. Another way to approach this is to consider the Punnett square for each possible pair. As I did earlier, when both parents are Bb, the Punnett square yields \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, which is the desired ratio. When one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the Punnett square also yields \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. So, both F and G lead to the correct ratio. Therefore, both pairs are possible, but the question asks for the most likely. Without more context, it's ambiguous, but in many problems, the assumption is that both parents are Bb, making G the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be redundant because option F is similar to G, just swapped. But perhaps the correct way is to see each parent pair and determine their possible offspring.\n\nSince both parents are giving either B or b alleles for the coat color, let me consider each possibility:\n\nOption A: Both parents are Bb. So each parent can give B or b. The Punnett square here would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). That translates to 25% black, 50% brown (wait, no\u2014wait, wait\u2014the coat color is black dominant, so the presence of at least one B means black; without B (i.e., two b's) means white). So in this case, the expected ratio would be 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). Wait, but according to the problem, the ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. So Option A would produce exactly that. Hmm, but let me check the other options too.\n\nOption B: One parent is BB, and the other is Bb. Then the possible gametes are B from the BB parent and B/b from the Bb parent. So the offspring would have: BB (25%) and Bb (50%), which translates to 75% black and 25% white. That also matches the given ratio. However, does the genotype of the parents match any of these options?\n\nWait, let me think again. Each parent's genotype must contribute to the outcome. For example, in Option A, both parents are Bb, so they're heterozygous. In Option B, one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous). Similarly, other options vary between homozygous dominant and heterozygous parents.\n\nBut the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. So which combination would lead to the observed offspring ratio? Well, both A and B could theoretically lead to the same ratio, but let's analyze further.\n\nIn Option A: Both parents are Bb. The possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So the phenotypic ratio is 75% black, 25% white.\n\nIn Option B: One parent is BB (100% B), and the other is Bb (50% B, 50% b). When crossed, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (from BB x B) and Bb (from BB x b) and another Bb (from Bb x B) and a bb (from Bb x b). So the phenotypes are: BB (100%), Bb (50%), and bb (50%). So the ratio is 100% black : 50% brown : 50% white. Wait, that's not matching the problem's 75% black : 25% white. Because in this case, all the offspring are either BB or Bb, meaning 100% black and 50% brown. Therefore, the phenotype ratio would be 100% black : 50% brown, which doesn't fit the problem's description of 75% black and 25% white.\n\nSo Option B cannot be correct because it produces a different ratio than required.\n\nNow, back to Option A: Both parents are Bb. The offspring would have a 75% black and 25% white ratio, as previously thought. This fits the problem's description perfectly.\n\nLet me quickly check the other options to make sure there's no other possibility.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see. The bb parent will always pass b, while the Bb parent can pass B or b. So the offspring would be 25% bb (white), 50% Bb (75% black), and 25% bb (white). Again, 75% black and 25% white. So this also fits the ratio.\n\nWait, but why did I get confused earlier? Because when considering Option B, I thought it produced a different ratio, but upon rechecking, I realize that I made a mistake in calculating the phenotypes. Option B leads to 100% black and 50% brown, which doesn't fit the problem's 75% black and 25% white. Therefore, Option B is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, checking other options:\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb (white). Ratio is 100% white. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to Option C. bb parent gives b, BB gives B. Offspring are 25% Bb (75% black) and 75% bb (25% white). Same as Options A and C. Fits.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. As above, same as Option C. 75% black, 25% white.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E and F. 75% black, 25% white.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Same as A. 75% black, 25% white.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Same as E and F. 75% black, 25% white.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring are BB (100% black). No match.\n\nTherefore, Options A, C, E, F, G, H, I all produce a 75% black : 25% white ratio. Now, the question asks which is the most likely genotype of the parents. It depends on whether the parents are both heterozygous (like A and E) or one is homozygous dominant and the other heterozygous (like C, F, etc.). However, since the problem states that both parents are involved, and the options include various combinations, the question is about which pair is more likely based on the information given.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"the most likely genotype of the parents was most likely.\" So among the options provided, which one correctly represents the parents leading to the observed ratio. Since multiple options produce the same ratio, but perhaps certain combinations are more likely based on the parents' relationship.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem expects us to select the pair where both parents are heterozygous, making the ratio 3:1, which is a common dihybrid cross scenario. Alternatively, if both parents are heterozygous, then the answer would be A or E.\n\nLooking back at the options, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) are possible scenarios that would result in the 75% black and 25% white ratio. So which one is more likely? Well, the question is phrased as \"The genotypes of the parents were most likely\" \u2014 implying that the parents' genotypes are part of the options given. Among the options, both A and E correspond to parents who are heterozygous. So perhaps the intended answer is A or E.\n\nHowever, looking back, the options provided include E (bb \u00d7 BB), which is essentially the same as A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) in terms of producing the same ratio, except for the order of parents. But since the parents' roles don't matter (they're both contributing alleles independently), both A and E are correct in terms of the ratio produced.\n\nWait, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Perhaps the key is that both parents are heterozygous, which would suggest that the parents are Bb and Bb, hence option A. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that would still produce the same ratio, as shown in option F (Bb \u00d7 bb). But in that case, the parents would be Bb and bb, which is another valid combination.\n\nWait, but going back to the initial analysis, both A and E (both parents being Bb) produce the desired ratio, as do F, C, G, H, I (where one parent is Bb and the other is bb). So the question is about which specific pair is present in the options.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the intended answer is A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) because it's a standard dihybrid cross scenario where the parents are both heterozygous. Alternatively, E (bb \u00d7 BB) is another possibility, but it's less common because typically the heterozygote would be more prevalent unless the parents are both homozygous.\n\nWait, but the problem statement doesn't specify anything else about the parents beyond their possible genotypes. Therefore, any of the pairs that result in the 75% black and 25% white ratio could be considered correct. However, the question is about which genotype is most likely, which might depend on the assumption that the parents are more likely to be heterozygous rather than homozygous. Thus, option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would be more likely than, say, option C (bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut wait, the question lists all possible combinations, so I need to pick the one that is listed among the options. Looking back, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. Option E is also correct, but it's the same as A in terms of producing the same ratio.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, first, I need to figure out what genotype combinations lead to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. For a single gene with two alleles where one is dominant, a 3:1 ratio usually comes from a dihybrid cross, like Aa \u00d7 Aa. But wait, no\u2014wait, the problem here involves a single gene, right? Because it's about hair color, not multiple genes. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing something. Wait, actually, the parents are two guinea pigs, each with a certain genotype, and they produce an average of three-quarters black and one-quarter white. So, each parent must contribute either a B or a b allele for the Bb or Bb genotype.\n\nWait, but since there are two parents, their combined gametes will determine the possible outcomes. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce a B or a b gamete. When they cross, the possible offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. The phenotypes would be B (black) and b (white). So, the probability of each genotype would be: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Therefore, the phenotype ratio would be 3:1 (BB and Bb as black, bb as white). That matches the problem statement exactly. So, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLet me check the other options to make sure none of them fit. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can produce a b or B gamete. So, the possible offspring would be bb (25%), Bb (50%), and BB (25%). Phenotype-wise, that's 1:1:1, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio given. Similarly, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as above; offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), leading to 3:1 ratio. Wait, that seems like another possibility. But hold on, does the order matter here? No, because whether it's Bb \u00d7 BB or BB \u00d7 Bb, the possible gametes are the same, just reversed. So, perhaps both Bb \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 Bb would result in a 3:1 ratio. However, looking back at the options, only option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would give 1:1:1 phenotypes. And option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, giving 1:1:1. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all bb (white) offspring, so 100% white, which doesn't fit. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as C, resulting in 1:1:1. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which also leads to 1:1:1. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same as C and D. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, leading to 100% BB, so 100% black. None of these except options A (BB\u00d7BB) and B (which includes BB\u00d7BB and Bb\u00d7bb) might fit, but let me think again.\n\nWait, no\u2014the parents could be BB \u00d7 BB, which would always give BB, so 100% black. Or if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would be B (from BB) and Bb, so the offspring would have 50% B (from B) and 50% Bb (from Bb). So, the phenotypes would be 50% B and 50% bb. Which gives a 1:1 ratio, not matching the 3:1 required. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, as in option A, the cross would yield 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 3:1 ratio. So, that works. Now, checking if any other options besides A give a 3:1 ratio. Option B lists two pairs: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see. If one parent is BB, all its gametes are B. The other parent is Bb, producing B and b in equal amounts. So, the cross would be:\n\nParent 1: BB \u2192 gametes: B  \nParent 2: Bb \u2192 gametes: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSo, combining these:\n\n- All offspring get B from Parent 1, and either B or b from Parent 2. Thus, offspring genotypes are BB (from B + B) and Bb (from B + b).\n\nPhenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black). So, the ratio would be 100% black, which is not the case here. So, option B wouldn't work. Similarly, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce all offsprings being either bb (white) or Bb (black). So, 50% black and 50% white, not 3:1. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would always produce bb (white), 100% white. Not relevant. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, similar to C, 50% black, 50% white. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Cross would be:\n\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 gametes B (50%) and b (50%)  \nParent 2: bb \u2192 gametes b (100%)\n\nSo, offspring genotypes: Bb (50%) and bb (50%). Phenotypes: 50% black (Bb) and 50% white (bb). Again, 1:1, not 3:1. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E, 50% Bb, 50% BB. So, same as before. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. As we saw earlier, this results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 3:1 ratio. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb. Offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%), 1:1 ratio. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, all BB, so 100% black. So, among all options, only option A (BB \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) result in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no, both A and H are the same. Wait, no, in the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both would result in 3:1. Wait, but the question says \"the most likely\", implying that it's a unique answer. Looking back, the correct parents should be Bb \u00d7 Bb, because that's the standard example for a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, you still get 3:1, but that's the same as Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014that's incorrect. Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, the possible gametes are B and b in equal proportions. So, the Punnett square would be:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nThus, 75% BB (black), 25% bb (white). So, that's a 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the same thing happens. So, both A and H would result in a 3:1 ratio. But in reality, the parents could be either BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 Bb. But according to the options, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) in terms of the outcome. Wait, no\u2014they are different combinations. Oh, no, wait, no\u2014option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. They both result in 3:1, but in different ways. Wait, no\u2014if you have Bb \u00d7 Bb, the possible offspring are BB, Bb, and bb, each with 25%, 50%, and 25%. So, 75% BB (black), 25% bb (white). Similarly, if you have BB \u00d7 Bb, the possible offspring are BB, Bb, and bb, same probabilities. So, both would lead to the same ratio. But in the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, technically, both would result in the correct ratio, but perhaps the parents are more likely to be Bb \u00d7 Bb because it's a common setup. But in reality, both A and H are correct in terms of the outcome. However, since the options don't allow us to choose between A and H, perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, let me double-check. The problem states \"the most likely\" parents. So, if both A and H are correct in the sense of producing 3:1, but perhaps the intended answer is A, because in some cases, the parents may be homozygous. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H because the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but I'm not entirely confident. Wait, no, the options include both A and H, so perhaps the correct answer is A because the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, while H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also produces the same ratio. But in reality, both would produce the same ratio, so perhaps the answer is A, because it's a standard example. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H because it's more straightforward. Wait, I'm getting confused now. Let me try to approach this differently. The key point is that the parents must produce gametes that result in a 3:1 ratio in the offspring. So, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the gametes are 50% B and 50% b. The Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 75% BB (black), 25% bb (white)\u20143:1. If the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, the gametes are B and b in equal parts. So, same result. So, both A and H produce the same ratio. But in the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, both are correct, but the question asks for the \"most likely.\" Maybe the intended answer is A because it's the standard example, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H because it's a more general case. Wait, no\u2014I think both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a more specific case. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is H because it's a more common way to present it. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in thinking that both would produce the same ratio. Wait, yes, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. So, perhaps the correct answer is A, because it's a specific example, whereas H is a more general case. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, making the answer A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option F is written as \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" and another option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\". But maybe some of these can be combined into a single answer since they might not all be distinct possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's think about what kind of cross results in a \u00be black and \u00bc white phenotype ratio. If the parents are heterozygous for the same gene, like Bb \u00d7 Bb, then their offspring would follow a 3:1 ratio because each parent can contribute either a B or a b allele. So, in this case, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. When you square them out, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Wait no, wait\u2014no, that's for a monohybrid cross when considering actual pigmentation. But in this case, the coat color is determined by the presence of the dominant allele, so any animal with at least one dominant allele (B) will express the dominant trait (black), while those with two recessive alleles (bb) will show the recessive trait (white). So, in the case where both parents are Bb, the possible gametes are B and b. Each parent can produce these gametes equally. When you make a Punnett square:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb and Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb.\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb and Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nBut combining these, the total would be:\n- BB: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Bb: 50% + 50% = 100%, but wait, no\u2014that approach doesn't add up correctly. Alternatively, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations without splitting them into separate cases. So for Bb x Bb:\n\nEach parent can give either B or b, so four combinations:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75% BB/Bb (black) and 25% bb (white).\n\nWhich matches the given data (three quarters black, one quarter white). So this makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems to fit perfectly. Let me check other options just to be thorough.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all the offspring would inherit the B allele from the first parent and the b from the second. So every offspring would be Bb, meaning all would be black. That's a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't match the \u00be black ratio. So F is incorrect.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is similar to F but with the parents swapped. Same reasoning applies; all offspring would be Bb, so all black. So C is also incorrect.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that gives. The parents can produce gametes B and B for BB and B, respectively, and B and b for Bb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are BB and Bb. So the gametes from BB are always B, and from Bb are B and b in equal amounts. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB (always B):\n- BB (if B combines with B)\n- Bb (if B combines with b)\n\nFrom Bb:\n- BB (if B combines with B)\n- Bb (if B combines with b)\n\nSo combining these, the possible genotypes are BB (from BB x B) and Bb (from BB x b) plus from Bb itself. Wait, more accurately, each parent contributes one allele. So the possible outcomes are:\n\n- BB (from BB)\n- Bb (from BB and Bb)\n- Bb (from Bb and B)\n- BB (from Bb and Bb)\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. The possible gametes are:\n\n- From BB: B (100%)\n- From Bb: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSo when they combine:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (another 25%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (another 25%)\n\nWait, but since each parent produces gametes independently, the Punnett square would be:\n\nParent 1: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 gametes B (100%).\nParent 2: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 gametes B (100%).\n\nSo all combinations are B (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2): BB. Or B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2): Bb. So the possible phenotypes are 25% BB and 75% Bb. But wait, that contradicts the observed 75% black and 25% white. Because if all are Bb, they should all be black. So Option H leads to all black, which doesn't fit the data.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would be bb (since B from BB and b from bb) \u2192 all white. Again, not matching the required ratio.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Then all offspring would be bb, so all white. Incorrect.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Similar to E and H; all offspring would be Bb, so all black. Incorrect.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Incorrect.\n\nThat leaves us with Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. This cross produces a 3:1 ratio of BB : Bb : bb, translating to 75% black and 25% white.

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option F is written as \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" and another option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\". But maybe some of these can be combined into a single answer since they might not all be distinct possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's think about what kind of cross results in a \u00be black and \u00bc white phenotype ratio. If the parents are heterozygous for the same gene, like Bb \u00d7 Bb, then their offspring would follow a 3:1 ratio because each parent can contribute either a B or a b allele. So, in this case, the possible genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. When you square them out, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Wait no, wait\u2014no, that's for a monohybrid cross when considering actual pigmentation. But in this case, the coat color is determined by the presence of the dominant allele, so any animal with at least one dominant allele (B) will express the dominant trait (black), while those with two recessive alleles (bb) will show the recessive trait (white). So, in the case where both parents are Bb, the possible gametes are B and b. Each parent can produce these gametes equally. When you make a Punnett square:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb and Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb.\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Bb and Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.\n\nBut combining these, the total would be:\n- BB: 25% + 25% = 50%\n- Bb: 50% + 50% = 100%, but wait, no\u2014that approach doesn't add up correctly. Alternatively, the correct way is to consider all possible combinations without splitting them into separate cases. So for Bb x Bb:\n\nEach parent can give either B or b, so four combinations:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is 75% BB/Bb (black) and 25% bb (white).\n\nWhich matches the given data (three quarters black, one quarter white). So this makes sense.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems to fit perfectly. Let me check other options just to be thorough.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all the offspring would inherit the B allele from the first parent and the b from the second. So every offspring would be Bb, meaning all would be black. That's a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't match the \u00be black ratio. So F is incorrect.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is similar to F but with the parents swapped. Same reasoning applies; all offspring would be Bb, so all black. So C is also incorrect.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that gives. The parents can produce gametes B and B for BB and B, respectively, and B and b for Bb. Wait, no\u2014the parents are BB and Bb. So the gametes from BB are always B, and from Bb are B and b in equal amounts. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB (always B):\n- BB (if B combines with B)\n- Bb (if B combines with b)\n\nFrom Bb:\n- BB (if B combines with B)\n- Bb (if B combines with b)\n\nSo combining these, the possible genotypes are BB (from BB x B) and Bb (from BB x b) plus from Bb itself. Wait, more accurately, each parent contributes one allele. So the possible outcomes are:\n\n- BB (from BB)\n- Bb (from BB and Bb)\n- Bb (from Bb and B)\n- BB (from Bb and Bb)\n\nWait, no. Let me correct this. The possible gametes are:\n\n- From BB: B (100%)\n- From Bb: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSo when they combine:\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (another 25%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (another 25%)\n\nWait, but since each parent produces gametes independently, the Punnett square would be:\n\nParent 1: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 gametes B (100%).\nParent 2: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 gametes B (100%).\n\nSo all combinations are B (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2): BB. Or B (from Parent 1) and b (from Parent 2): Bb. So the possible phenotypes are 25% BB and 75% Bb. But wait, that contradicts the observed 75% black and 25% white. Because if all are Bb, they should all be black. So Option H leads to all black, which doesn't fit the data.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would be bb (since B from BB and b from bb) \u2192 all white. Again, not matching the required ratio.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Then all offspring would be bb, so all white. Incorrect.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Similar to E and H; all offspring would be Bb, so all black. Incorrect.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Incorrect.\n\nThat leaves us with Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. This cross produces a 3:1 ratio of BB : Bb : bb, translating to 75% black and 25% white.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these seem repeated, maybe they're just different ways of presenting the same parents. But since the options need to be considered as possible pairs, perhaps the correct answer is among these. Let me think about the possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, since the coat color is determined by one gene and the presence of the dominant allele leads to black, the parents must have contributed alleles that, when combined, can lead to a 3:1 ratio. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then their offspring will show a 1:2:1 ratio for BB, Bb, and bb. That's a 1/4 chance for each genotype, leading to 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But in this case, the ratio is \u00be black to \u00bc white, not 1:2:1. So option A might not be correct because that results in equal distribution, not tripling the black coat phenotype.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be Bb, resulting in 100% Bb and thus all black. But the observed ratio includes white, so that's not the case here. Therefore, neither B nor D seems right because those include homozygotes where one parent is homozygous recessive, which doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white scenario.\n\nLooking back at the possible answers, C says bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that would produce. When a Bb parent (heterozygous) is crossed with a bb parent (homozygous recessive), each offspring will receive the b allele from the bb parent and the B or b from the Bb parent. So, the possible gametes are B (from Bb) and b (from bb). So the offspring would have a 50% chance of being Bb (which is Bb and would give black coat because B is dominant) and a 50% chance of being bb (which gives white coat). So that's exactly what's happening here\u2014three-quarters black (BB and Bb) and one-quarter white (bb). Wait, no, actually, wait. If you cross Bb with bb, you get 50% Bb and 50% bb. So 50% black (since B is dominant) and 50% white. But the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white. Hmm, so that's half the expected outcome. Does any of the options match this?\n\nWait, let me check another possibility. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C. So that should also produce 50% black and 50% white. That's not matching the 3:1 ratio mentioned in the problem. Then why does the problem say three quarters have black? Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me reconsider. If the parents are Bb and Bb, then the offspring would have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So 25+50=75% black (because BB and Bb have at least one dominant B), and 25% white. That fits the \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. So option A would give that ratio. However, earlier I thought that the \u00be comes from \u00be BB + \u00be Bb, which adds up correctly. So why did I think that option C was correct earlier? Oh, because I misread the problem statement. No, wait\u2014the problem states that the offspring have three quarters black and one quarter white, which aligns perfectly with option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n    | B   | b\n---|-----|---\nB | BB  | Bb \nb | Bb  | bb \n\nSo, four outcomes: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. Which simplifies to 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Thus, 75% BB/Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches the given ratio of \u00be black and \u00bc white. So option A seems correct. But earlier, I thought that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) produces a 50-50 split, but that's not matching the 3:1 ratio. So why is there confusion here?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem. It says \"the scientists carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats.\" So both parents have black coats. Now, when you have two parents, each contributing an allele, the offspring's coat color depends on whether they received at least one dominant allele (B) or the recessive (b).\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then each can contribute B or b. The probability of getting BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. So 75% black and 25% white, which is exactly the ratio described. So option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) should be correct.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let me consider that. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the offspring would have a 75% chance of receiving B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So the possible genotypes would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%). So, 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black, since B is dominant). Hence, 75% black and 25% white, same as option A. So both option A and option G would produce the same ratio. But according to the options provided, both A and G are possible, but in reality, only one pair would produce that ratio.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 BB) result in 75% black and 25% white. So why are they presented separately? Perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the other options.\n\nLet me think again. Another approach: using the ratio 3:1, which implies that each offspring has a 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (B) and a 1/4 chance of having two recessive alleles (bb). So, the parents must be such that when they contribute alleles, the possible combinations lead to this outcome.\n\nIf the parents are Bb and Bb, as I thought earlier, the possible gametes are B and b, each 50%. So the Punnett square yields BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), leading to 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). Alternatively, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the possible offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), same as before. But wait, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have a 75% chance of being B (since B is dominant) and 25% bb. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb. That corresponds to option H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait a minute! So now I'm confused. Because option A and option H both produce a 75% black to 25% white ratio. How can both be correct? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous. For example, one parent could be homozygous recessive (bb), and the other heterozygous (Bb). In that case, the offspring would be Bb (50% B, 50% b). So 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit the given ratio. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, that's option A, which works. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that's option H, which also works. So both A and H produce the correct ratio. But in the options provided, both A and H are present. But the user hasn't specified multiple correct answers; the assistant should select based on the reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The user listed options A to J, with some duplicates like B and F, etc. Looking back, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both produce the desired 3:1 ratio. So why are these two options present? Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nAh, perhaps I overlooked that the problem mentions \"the most likely genotype,\" implying that the parents are most likely to have certain genotypes. But without more information, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb (option A) or one Bb and one BB (option H). But I need to find which pair is more likely to result in the observed ratio.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If the parents are both Bb, then the probability of each genotype in the offspring is 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, if the parents are BB and Bb, the offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), same as before. So both A and H result in the same ratio. But perhaps the question expects us to choose the simplest form, which is option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) rather than option H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Or perhaps the question assumes that one parent is Bb and the other is bb, but that wouldn't fit the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (50%) and bb (50%), leading to 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit. So that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both options A and H produce the correct ratio. But looking back, the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the question is phrased.\n\nWait, another angle: the fact that the parents are both carriers (i.e., have at least one dominant allele) is important. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, they can't produce any B alleles, hence all offspring would be bb, leading to white coats. But the problem states that the parents have black coats, meaning they are both at least Bb or BB. So, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that's option H, which produces the correct ratio. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, that's option A, which also produces the correct ratio.\n\nNow, going back to the question, it asks which genotype pair is most likely. But without additional information, both A and H could theoretically produce the desired ratio. However, the options don't allow for selecting both; perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the fact that the parents are both Bb (option A) versus one being BB and the other Bb (option H). The question provides options, and I need to pick the correct one. Since both produce the correct ratio, but option A is more straightforward, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that when both parents are Bb, the offspring are 75% B and 25% b, while when one is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring are still 75% B and 25% b. So both situations result in the same ratio. But in the options, both A and H are available, but perhaps the answer is A because it's simpler.\n\nWait, another thought: in the cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the parents are both heterozygous, so the ratio is 3:1. In contrast, if the parents are BB and Bb, the offspring are still 3:1. So both are correct, but perhaps the question expects the parents to be Bb and Bb, making option A correct.\n\nBut looking back, I think I may have made a mistake earlier when evaluating the possibilities. Let me try once more. Let's take option H: BB \u00d7 Bb. The possible gametes are B from BB and B from Bb. So the gametes are B and B. So all the offspring would inherit B from the BB parent, and either B or b from the Bb parent. So all offspring would have at least one B, so 100% B, which is black. That contradicts the given ratio, so option H cannot be correct. Therefore, option H is incorrect.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I thought that option H would produce 75% black, but upon closer examination, option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in all offspring being BB (if the Bb parent always gives B) or Bb. Wait, no, the Bb parent can only give B or b. So in option H, the Bb parent can only give B (since it's Bb). Wait, no\u2014if the Bb parent can only give B or b, then all offspring from the Bb parent would carry B. So if the other parent is BB, which can only give B, then all offspring would have B from both parents, making them all BB (100% B). So that's not correct, meaning option H cannot be correct because it results in all black coats, contradicting the 75% black ratio.\n\nThat means my previous conclusion was wrong. So the correct parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb (option A), because then the offspring would be 75% B and 25% b, leading to the observed ratio. So the correct answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So 50% black (since B is dominant) and 50% white. But the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white. Hmm, so that's half the expected outcome. Does any of the options match this?\n\nWait, let me check another possibility. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C. So that should also produce 50% black and 50% white. That's not matching the 3:1 ratio mentioned in the problem. Then why does the problem say three quarters have black? Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me reconsider. If the parents are Bb and Bb, then the offspring would have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So 25+50=75% black (because BB and Bb have at least one dominant B), and 25% white. That fits the \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. So option A would give that ratio. However, earlier I thought that the \u00be comes from \u00be BB + \u00be Bb, which adds up correctly. So why did I think that option C was correct earlier? Oh, because I misread the problem statement. No, wait\u2014the problem states that the offspring have three quarters black and one quarter white, which aligns perfectly with option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut wait, let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n    | B   | b\n---|-----|---\nB | BB  | Bb \nb | Bb  | bb \n\nSo, four outcomes: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. Which simplifies to 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Thus, 75% BB/Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches the given ratio of \u00be black and \u00bc white. So option A seems correct. But earlier, I thought that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) produces a 50-50 split, but that's not matching the 3:1 ratio. So why is there confusion here?\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something in the initial setup. Let me re-examine the problem. It says \"the scientists carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats.\" So both parents have black coats. Now, when you have two parents, each contributing an allele, the offspring's coat color depends on whether they received at least one dominant allele (B) or the recessive (b).\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then each can contribute B or b. The probability of getting BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. So 75% black and 25% white, which is exactly the ratio described. So option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) should be correct.\n\nHowever, in the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let me consider that. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the offspring would have a 75% chance of receiving B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So the possible genotypes would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%). So, 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black, since B is dominant). Hence, 75% black and 25% white, same as option A. So both option A and option G would produce the same ratio. But according to the options provided, both A and G are possible, but in reality, only one pair would produce that ratio.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and G (Bb \u00d7 BB) result in 75% black and 25% white. So why are they presented separately? Perhaps I've made a mistake in considering the other options.\n\nLet me think again. Another approach: using the ratio 3:1, which implies that each offspring has a 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (B) and a 1/4 chance of having two recessive alleles (bb). So, the parents must be such that when they contribute alleles, the possible combinations lead to this outcome.\n\nIf the parents are Bb and Bb, as I thought earlier, the possible gametes are B and b, each 50%. So the Punnett square yields BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), leading to 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). Alternatively, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the possible offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), same as before. But wait, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have a 75% chance of being B (since B is dominant) and 25% bb. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb. That corresponds to option H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait a minute! So now I'm confused. Because option A and option H both produce a 75% black to 25% white ratio. How can both be correct? Or perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the parents are not both heterozygous. For example, one parent could be homozygous recessive (bb), and the other heterozygous (Bb). In that case, the offspring would be Bb (50% B, 50% b). So 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit the given ratio. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, that's option A, which works. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that's option H, which also works. So both A and H produce the correct ratio. But in the options provided, both A and H are present. But the user hasn't specified multiple correct answers; the assistant should select based on the reasoning.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. The user listed options A to J, with some duplicates like B and F, etc. Looking back, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both produce the desired 3:1 ratio. So why are these two options present? Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nAh, perhaps I overlooked that the problem mentions \"the most likely genotype,\" implying that the parents are most likely to have certain genotypes. But without more information, it's hard to tell. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb (option A) or one Bb and one BB (option H). But I need to find which pair is more likely to result in the observed ratio.\n\nWait, let me think differently. If the parents are both Bb, then the probability of each genotype in the offspring is 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, if the parents are BB and Bb, the offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), same as before. So both A and H result in the same ratio. But perhaps the question expects us to choose the simplest form, which is option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) rather than option H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Or perhaps the question assumes that one parent is Bb and the other is bb, but that wouldn't fit the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (50%) and bb (50%), leading to 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit. So that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, both options A and H produce the correct ratio. But looking back, the options are given as separate choices, so perhaps the intended answer is A. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something in the way the question is phrased.\n\nWait, another angle: the fact that the parents are both carriers (i.e., have at least one dominant allele) is important. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, they can't produce any B alleles, hence all offspring would be bb, leading to white coats. But the problem states that the parents have black coats, meaning they are both at least Bb or BB. So, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that's option H, which produces the correct ratio. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, that's option A, which also produces the correct ratio.\n\nNow, going back to the question, it asks which genotype pair is most likely. But without additional information, both A and H could theoretically produce the desired ratio. However, the options don't allow for selecting both; perhaps I'm misunderstanding the question.\n\nWait, perhaps I should focus on the fact that the parents are both Bb (option A) versus one being BB and the other Bb (option H). The question provides options, and I need to pick the correct one. Since both produce the correct ratio, but option A is more straightforward, perhaps that's the intended answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question considers that when both parents are Bb, the offspring are 75% B and 25% b, while when one is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring are still 75% B and 25% b. So both situations result in the same ratio. But in the options, both A and H are available, but perhaps the answer is A because it's simpler.\n\nWait, another thought: in the cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the parents are both heterozygous, so the ratio is 3:1. In contrast, if the parents are BB and Bb, the offspring are still 3:1. So both are correct, but perhaps the question expects the parents to be Bb and Bb, making option A correct.\n\nBut looking back, I think I may have made a mistake earlier when evaluating the possibilities. Let me try once more. Let's take option H: BB \u00d7 Bb. The possible gametes are B from BB and B from Bb. So the gametes are B and B. So all the offspring would inherit B from the BB parent, and either B or b from the Bb parent. So all offspring would have at least one B, so 100% B, which is black. That contradicts the given ratio, so option H cannot be correct. Therefore, option H is incorrect.\n\nWait, that changes things. Earlier, I thought that option H would produce 75% black, but upon closer examination, option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in all offspring being BB (if the Bb parent always gives B) or Bb. Wait, no, the Bb parent can only give B or b. So in option H, the Bb parent can only give B (since it's Bb). Wait, no\u2014if the Bb parent can only give B or b, then all offspring from the Bb parent would carry B. So if the other parent is BB, which can only give B, then all offspring would have B from both parents, making them all BB (100% B). So that's not correct, meaning option H cannot be correct because it results in all black coats, contradicting the 75% black ratio.\n\nThat means my previous conclusion was wrong. So the correct parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb (option A), because then the offspring would be 75% B and 25% b, leading to the observed ratio. So the correct answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white).

Let's think about possible scenarios.\n\nIn a monohybrid cross (one gene), if both parents are heterozygous (Bb), the expected ratio is 3:1 (dominant: recessive). That fits perfectly because here, the offspring would be \u00be Bb (heterozygous, hence black) and \u00bc BB (homozygous dominant, also black), making 3/4 black and 1/4 white. Wait, no\u2014because actually, when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, each parent can contribute B or b. So, the Punnett square would show:\n\n- B from parent 1 and B from parent 2 \u2192 BB (black)\n- B from parent 1 and b from parent 2 \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from parent 1 and B from parent 2 \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from parent 1 and b from parent 2 \u2192 bb (white)\n\nWait, but that gives three outcomes: BB (black) and bb (white). Each of the four combinations occurs equally, so the ratio should be 3:1. But wait, the question says \u00be black and \u00bc white. So that matches perfectly with the Bb \u00d7 Bb cross. So option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, hold on\u2014the parents are both Bb, right?\n\nWait no, let me check the options again. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. So if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then their offspring will have the following possibilities:\n\nParent 1: B or b  \nParent 2: B  \n\nSo the offspring will be BB (if B from both) or Bb (if b from parent 1 and B from parent 2). Now, considering the dominance hierarchy, B is dominant over b. So BB and Bb are both black, while bb would be white. Therefore, the expected ratio is 3:1 as well (three black and one white). This seems correct.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, then the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to 3:1 ratio of BB and Bb (black) to bb (white). So that's another possibility.\n\nBut let's see the options. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, what happens? The offspring will be:\n\nFrom BB parent: always B  \nFrom Bb parent: B or b  \n\nSo the offspring can be BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Both are black, so the ratio is 100% black, which doesn't match the given data. So option H is not correct.\n\nSimilarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Then the offspring would be Bb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). So the ratio is 3:1 (3 Bb and 1 bb). Again, that results in \u00be black and \u00bc white, matching the given information. So both G (Bb \u00d7 BB) and F (Bb \u00d7 bb) seem to fit the 3:1 ratio.\n\nNow, I need to determine which of these is more likely based on the parents' genotype possibilities. Let me evaluate each possibility:\n\nFor option G (Bb \u00d7 BB):\n\nParents are Bb and BB. Since BB is homozygous dominant, any gamete it produces is B. The other parent is Bb, which can produce B or b. So the offspring will be BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). Both are black. So all offspring will have black coats, which means 100% black. But according to the problem, there's only a 75% chance of black. So option G cannot be correct because it would give 100% black, not \u00be.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that Bb \u00d7 Bb would also give \u00be black. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify. When both parents are Bb, the Punnett square would indeed give 3/4 BB (black) and 1/4 bb (white). However, when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 100% Bb (since B from BB and B or b from Bb; wait, no, BB can't pass anything except B, and Bb can pass B or b. So the offspring would be BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). Both are black. So 100% black. But according to the problem, only \u00be have black. So that leaves us with options where the parents don't include an homozygous dominant.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get \u00be black is if both parents are heterozygous, i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because in that case, the Punnett square shows 3/4 BB and 1/4 bb.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Suppose both parents are Bb. Cross them:\n\nPossible gametes from each parent: B and b, each with equal probability.\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\nBB (from B + B)  \nBb (from B + b)  \nbb (from b + b)\n\nThe phenotypes would be:\n\nBB \u2192 black  \nBb \u2192 black  \nbb \u2192 white  \n\nSo the ratio is 3:1, which matches the given \u00be black. So option G is correct.\n\nBut now, going back to the initial analysis, I had two candidates: G and F. But F would result in 100% black, which doesn't fit. So why did I think earlier that Bb \u00d7 Bb gives 3:1? Because I was confusing with a different example, like a dihybrid cross, but in this case, since it's monohybrid, Bb \u00d7 Bb is the correct scenario.\n\nLet me make sure I didn't miss any other options. Looking at option D: bb \u00d7 bb. That would produce all bb offspring, which is 100% white. Not matching the \u00be black. Similarly, option E: bb \u00d7 BB would produce 50% bb and 50% BB. 50% white, which doesn't match. Option I: BB \u00d7 bb. Offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), same as F. Option J: BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring are BB, 100% black. Option C: bb \u00d7 Bb. As above, 50% bb and 50% Bb. Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is our previous candidate. Option B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. So, a mix of two different crosses, which might lead to some offspring being from Bb \u00d7 Bb and others from Bb \u00d7 bb. Would that affect the overall ratio? Let's see.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is BB, we already saw that leads to 100% Bb, so all black. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all offspring are Bb (black), 100% black. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same as before: 100% black. So any cross involving a BB and a non-BB parent would result in all black. Any cross involving only Bb parents would result in 3:1 (3 black, 1 white). So when the question says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely\", meaning each parent's genotype is among the options.\n\nLooking back, the correct answer must be the one where both parents are Bb. Because only that cross would produce the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the offspring would all be Bb (3:1), which is a different scenario.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 3:1. So that's correct. So the correct answer would be G, Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all offspring are Bb (black), 100% black. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same as before: 100% black. So any cross involving a BB and a non-BB parent would result in all black. Any cross involving only Bb parents would result in 3:1 (3 black, 1 white). So when the question says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely\", meaning each parent's genotype is among the options.\n\nLooking back, the correct answer must be the one where both parents are Bb. Because only that cross would produce the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the offspring would all be Bb (3:1), which is a different scenario.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 3:1. So that's correct. So the correct answer would be G, Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, the way the options are written might be a bit confusing because some are listed as pairs and others as individual genotypes. But perhaps it's better to consider each option as a possible genotype pair. For example, option C says \"bb \u00d7 Bb\", meaning one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Let me think about how their offspring would look.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross where one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the possible gametes from Bb are B and b (each with equal probability), while the gamete from bb is only b. When they combine, the possible offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- From Bb x bb:\n  - B (from Bb) + b (from bb) = Bb\n  - b (from Bb) + b (from bb) = bb\n\nSo the ratio would be 1:1 for Bb : bb. Now, considering the coat color:\n\n- Bb has black (dominant)\n- bb has white (recessive)\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1. But wait, the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white, which is a 3:1 ratio. That doesn't match 1:1. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, then each will produce gametes B and b. So the Punnett square would have four possibilities: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Phenotypically, BB and Bb are black, and bb is white. So the ratio would be 3/4 black to 1/4 white. That matches exactly with the problem statement! Therefore, the correct parents must both be Bb, making the answer A.\n\nLet me quickly check another option just to make sure. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\". Wait, no\u2014option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\". If one parent is bb (only bb genotype, so all recessive) and the other is BB (homozygous dominant), then all offspring would be Bb. Because when you mate bb and BB, the gametes from BB are B, and from bb are b. So all offspring would get B from BB and b from bb, hence Bb. Since Bb is dominant, all offspring would have black coats. That gives a 100% black phenotype ratio, which is not the case here. So E can't be right.\n\nOption F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\". As I thought before, this would result in a 3:1 ratio. So yes, this fits. Wait, but earlier I considered A as the correct answer. Let me double-check.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb. The Punnett square would be:\n\nBB | Bb  \n---|---\nBb | Bb  \n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Phenotypically, BB and Bb are black, so 3/4, and bb is white, 1/4. So that's correct.\n\nBut wait, in my initial analysis, I concluded that A was the correct answer, but now I see that F is also an option. But why?\n\nAh, because in the problem statement, the parents are being crossed, but the parents may not necessarily be Bb. Maybe one parent is Bb and the other is bb, resulting in \u00be black. Or both parents are Bb, leading to \u00be black. Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Let me check that.\n\nIf one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the cross would be BB \u00d7 Bb. The possible offspring genotypes are BB and Bb. All BB and Bb would show black, since B is dominant. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100%, which doesn't fit. So that's incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility is one parent is BB and the other is bb. Then all offspring would be Bb, showing black. Again, 100% black. Incorrect.\n\nWhat about one parent is BB and the other is Bb? No, same as above. How about one parent is BB and the other is BB? Then all offspring would be BB, showing black. Still 100%.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same as above.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are one BB and one Bb. Then all offspring would be Bb, showing black. 100% again.\n\nHmm, but the 3:1 ratio occurs when one parent is Bb and the other is bb, or both parents are Bb. Wait, but in the first case, when both parents are Bb, the cross results in \u00be BB/Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white).\n\nWhen one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross results in 75% Bb and 25% bb (so 75% black, 25% white). So both cases where both parents are Bb, or one parent is Bb and the other is bb, give the same 3:1 ratio. But in the options provided, option F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", which would result in the 3:1 ratio, whereas option A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\".\n\nBut wait, according to the problem statement, the parents' genotypes were most likely... So if the parents are Bb and Bb, the cross produces \u00be black and \u00bc white. If the parents are Bb and bb, the same outcome happens. So both A and F seem to lead to the same phenotype ratio. However, the question asks which option is correct based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \n\nBoth A and F would lead to \u00be black and \u00bc white. But the options are separate letters, implying only one is correct. However, perhaps the parents are different. Let me re-examine the possible cross outcomes.\n\nWait, another approach: the number of phenotypic classes should match the expected ratios. Here, there are two phenotypes: black and white. Each with certain proportions.\n\nThe cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb: \u00be BB (black), \u00bc bb (white). So 3:1.\n\nCross of Bb \u00d7 bb: \u00be Bb (black), \u00bc bb (white). Also 3:1.\n\nSimilarly, cross of BB \u00d7 Bb: Same as Bb \u00d7 Bb, since the parents would produce the same gametes. So same result.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". Both would produce 3:1. But perhaps the question implies that the parents are such that each can produce only certain gametes.\n\nWait, but in reality, the Bb \u00d7 Bb cross would result in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, while Bb \u00d7 bb would also result in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, so same phenotype ratio.\n\nHowever, looking at the options again, the user presented the options as:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, in the original presentation, the options after G are H, I, J, etc., but perhaps some are duplicates or mislabeled. But looking at F, which is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", that leads to 3:1.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, the cross would still be \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, giving 3:1. Similarly, BB \u00d7 BB would give 100% BB, so 1:0.\n\nWait, but in the options, option I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\", which would produce \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, same as F. So perhaps multiple options lead to the same phenotype ratio. But the question is asking for the most likely parents, so perhaps any of A, F, I, etc., would work. But among the options, F is present.\n\nWait, but looking back, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify:\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then the cross would be:\n\nParent 1: Bb (B and b)  \nParent 2: Bb (B and b)  \n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\nBB (from B and B)  \nBb (from B and b)  \nBb (from B and b)  \nbb (from b and b)  \n\nPhenotype-wise:\n\nBB and Bb \u2192 black (dominant B)  \nbb \u2192 white  \n\nThus, \u00be black, \u00bc white. Correct.\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the possible offspring are:\n\nBb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). So:\n\nBb (B and b) \u2192 black  \nbb \u2192 white  \n\nThus, same ratio. So both A and F would produce the desired phenotype ratio.\n\nBut in the options, both A and F are present, but the user lists F as \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" and A as \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". So both A and F would be correct, but perhaps only one of them is listed correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct parents are both Bb, i.e., option A, because the other options involve mixed genotypes that don't change the ratio.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options. For instance, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". Cross of BB \u00d7 Bb:\n\nParent 1: BB (only B)  \nParent 2: Bb (B and b)  \n\nPossible offspring:\n\nBB (from B and B)  \nBb (from B and b)  \n\nSo phenotypically, all offspring would be Bb, thus black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit the problem statement. So option H cannot be correct.\n\nOption D is \"bb \u00d7 bb\": Cross would produce all bb, so 100% white, which is wrong.\n\nOption E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\": Same as option A but reversed. Cross of bb \u00d7 BB:\n\nParent 1: bb (only b)  \nParent 2: BB (only B)  \n\nPossible offspring:\n\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black  \n\nAll would be Bb, so 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\": same as option F; 3:1.\n\nOption G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\": same as option A but reverse; 3:1.\n\nOption I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\": same as F and A, 3:1.\n\nOption J is \"BB \u00d7 BB\": 100% BB, so 1:0, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo both A and F produce the same ratio, but only one option is available. Looking back at the options, F is present. So the correct answer should be either A or F.\n\nBut in the problem, it's stated as a single-letter answer. So I need to choose between A and F. Wait, but in the options, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". So both are possible. But perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to 3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me summarize:\n\nParents are crossed, resulting in \u00be black, \u00bc white.\n\nWhich genotype pair leads to this?\n\n- Both parents are Bb: \u00be Bb, \u00bc bb \u2192 3:1.\n- One parent is Bb, the other is bb: same as above.\n\nSo both A and F would work, but the options include both. However, perhaps the question expects the parents to be both Bb, making option A the correct choice.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". They are distinct but both result in the same ratio. So without additional information, both would be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F, as it explicitly uses Bb and bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb, producing 3:1. So the parents could be either. However, looking at the options, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", which is one possibility, and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\", which is another. Both are valid, but perhaps the intended answer is F.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the most likely\", implying that among the options, which one is more probable. Perhaps in reality, Bb \u00d7 Bb is more straightforward than mixing Bb and bb, but I think both are equally likely.\n\nWait, but perhaps the parents are both Bb, so option A, because that's the simplest case where both parents contribute B and b. Whereas option F involves one parent being Bb and the other bb. Both are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, the question might have a typo, but assuming that the options are accurate, the correct answers would be A and F. But since I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me verify once again. When both parents are Bb, the cross produces \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, giving 3:1. When one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the same happens. So both A and F would yield the correct ratio. But looking at the options, both exist. However, perhaps the question is expecting the parents to be both Bb, so option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it directly shows the 3:1 ratio without any complications.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. To resolve this, I'll recall that in dihybrid crosses, the 3:1 ratio typically comes from squares of Bb \u00d7 Bb, or Bb \u00d7 bb. Thus, both options A and F would produce the same phenotype ratio. However, since the question asks for the most likely parents, perhaps A is the intended answer because it's a simpler case where both parents are heterozygous for the same trait.\n\nAlternatively, F is also a correct option, but I think the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, F is present, so perhaps it's the best answer.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to eliminate other options. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\", which would produce 100% Bb, which is black, so 1:0. Not correct.\n\nOption I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\", similar to F and A, producing 3:1.\n\nOptions C and D are homozygous, so they'd produce 100% homozygotes, which don't fit.\n\nOption J is homozygous BB, same issue.\n\nSo, going back, the correct parents are either A or F. But since the question is phrased as a single-letter answer, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the 3:1 ratio comes from a monohybrid cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the simplest case. So option A makes sense as the parents are likely to be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So both A and F would be correct, but perhaps only one of them is listed correctly.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct parents are both Bb, i.e., option A, because the other options involve mixed genotypes that don't change the ratio.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options. For instance, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". Cross of BB \u00d7 Bb:\n\nParent 1: BB (only B)  \nParent 2: Bb (B and b)  \n\nPossible offspring:\n\nBB (from B and B)  \nBb (from B and b)  \n\nSo phenotypically, all offspring would be Bb, thus black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit the problem statement. So option H cannot be correct.\n\nOption D is \"bb \u00d7 bb\": Cross would produce all bb, so 100% white, which is wrong.\n\nOption E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\": Same as option A but reversed. Cross of bb \u00d7 BB:\n\nParent 1: bb (only b)  \nParent 2: BB (only B)  \n\nPossible offspring:\n\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black  \n\nAll would be Bb, so 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\": same as option F; 3:1.\n\nOption G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\": same as option A but reverse; 3:1.\n\nOption I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\": same as F and A, 3:1.\n\nOption J is \"BB \u00d7 BB\": 100% BB, so 1:0, which doesn't fit.\n\nSo both A and F produce the same ratio, but only one option is available. Looking back at the options, F is present. So the correct answer should be either A or F.\n\nBut in the problem, it's stated as a single-letter answer. So I need to choose between A and F. Wait, but in the options, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". So both are possible. But perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to 3:1.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me summarize:\n\nParents are crossed, resulting in \u00be black, \u00bc white.\n\nWhich genotype pair leads to this?\n\n- Both parents are Bb: \u00be Bb, \u00bc bb \u2192 3:1.\n- One parent is Bb, the other is bb: same as above.\n\nSo both A and F would work, but the options include both. However, perhaps the question expects the parents to be both Bb, making option A the correct choice.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". They are distinct but both result in the same ratio. So without additional information, both would be correct, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F, as it explicitly uses Bb and bb.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let me think again: the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb, producing 3:1. So the parents could be either. However, looking at the options, F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\", which is one possibility, and A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\", which is another. Both are valid, but perhaps the intended answer is F.\n\nWait, but the problem states \"the most likely\", implying that among the options, which one is more probable. Perhaps in reality, Bb \u00d7 Bb is more straightforward than mixing Bb and bb, but I think both are equally likely.\n\nWait, but perhaps the parents are both Bb, so option A, because that's the simplest case where both parents contribute B and b. Whereas option F involves one parent being Bb and the other bb. Both are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nAlternatively, the question might have a typo, but assuming that the options are accurate, the correct answers would be A and F. But since I have to choose one, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake. Let me verify once again. When both parents are Bb, the cross produces \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, giving 3:1. When one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the same happens. So both A and F would yield the correct ratio. But looking at the options, both exist. However, perhaps the question is expecting the parents to be both Bb, so option A.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it directly shows the 3:1 ratio without any complications.\n\nBut I'm not entirely sure. To resolve this, I'll recall that in dihybrid crosses, the 3:1 ratio typically comes from squares of Bb \u00d7 Bb, or Bb \u00d7 bb. Thus, both options A and F would produce the same phenotype ratio. However, since the question asks for the most likely parents, perhaps A is the intended answer because it's a simpler case where both parents are heterozygous for the same trait.\n\nAlternatively, F is also a correct option, but I think the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but looking at the options, F is present, so perhaps it's the best answer.\n\nWait, but I'm getting stuck. Let me try to eliminate other options. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\", which would produce 100% Bb, which is black, so 1:0. Not correct.\n\nOption I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\", similar to F and A, producing 3:1.\n\nOptions C and D are homozygous, so they'd produce 100% homozygotes, which don't fit.\n\nOption J is homozygous BB, same issue.\n\nSo, going back, the correct parents are either A or F. But since the question is phrased as a single-letter answer, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nBut I'm not entirely confident. Another approach: the 3:1 ratio comes from a monohybrid cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the simplest case. So option A makes sense as the parents are likely to be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nYes, I think that's the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these might be redundant because option C and D seem similar except for the order of parents. Option F is another way to write Bb \u00d7 bb. Similarly, G and H are the same as Bb \u00d7 BB and BB \u00d7 Bb respectively. Options E and I are different pairs, but they involve the same parents in reverse. D is two separate crosses, while others combine two parents into a single genotype pair.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to figure out is what possible genotypes could lead to a \u00be black, \u00bc white offspring ratio when crossed. For a simple case like a single gene locus with two alleles, where the dominant is expressed, the expected phenotypic ratio depends on the genotype of the parents.\n\nThe simplest case is when both parents are heterozygous (Bb), meaning each can produce a 50% B and 50% b allele. When you cross two heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). However, since black is dominant, those with at least one B will express the dominant trait, resulting in 75% black and 25% white. That matches exactly what the problem states. So, parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb would fit. But wait, let me check if any other combinations also lead to a 3:1 ratio. For example, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb), then all the offspring would be Bb, which would still give a 100% Bb phenotype, not matching the problem's description. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then as I thought before, it leads to a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then their offspring would be 75% B and 25% b. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then each gamete from the BB parent is B, and from the Bb parent, there's a 50% B and 50% b. So the offspring would get either B from the BB parent or Bb from the Bb parent. No, actually, more accurately, the possible genotypes would be BB (from BB \u00d7 Bb): all B, and Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb) and bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb). So, the offspring would be 100% BB (if from BB \u00d7 Bb) and 50% Bb and 50% bb. But since black is dominant, the phenotypes would be 100% black (since all B) and 50% white (for bb). That doesn't match the \u00be black, \u00bc white ratio, so that's incorrect. Therefore, the correct parents must be both Bb, making each parent contribute 50% B and 50% b, leading to a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Phenotypically, 75% black and 25% white.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 Bb. So that should work too. Wait, but in my earlier analysis, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 Bb. So that's another possibility. But does it matter who is the Bb and who is BB? Because in a cross, the parents are interchangeable. So whether you're Bb \u00d7 BB or Bb \u00d7 Bb, the outcome is the same. So perhaps option G and option A are essentially the same in terms of the offspring ratio.\n\nBut hold on, the question asks \"the most likely\" which implies that among the options, which one(s) correctly leads to the observed ratio. Let me check each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Correct, as discussed.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This is a cross of four different genotypes. Let's see what happens. Each parent contributes an allele. For BB \u00d7 BB: all offspring will be BB. For Bb \u00d7 bb: the offspring will be Bb (from Bb) and bb (from bb), so they'll be Bb, which expresses black. So all offspring would be black. Thus, 100% black, which doesn't match the 75% black described. So option B is wrong.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Same as A, just reversed. So the same outcome, 75% black. So this works too.\n\nOption D: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. As above, this leads to 100% black, so wrong.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Same as C, so 75% black. Works.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 This is similar to option C. Both parents are Bb and bb. Wait, no\u2014option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is equivalent to Bb \u00d7 Bb. So yes, same as option A and C. Correct.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Same as A and C. Correct.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Same as A and C. Correct.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 This is similar to C and E. Correct.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 All offspring are BB, so 100% black. Wrong.\n\nNow, looking at the options, options A, C, E, F, G, H, I are all possibilities where the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or any combination involving Bb and bb, such as Bb \u00d7 BB or BB \u00d7 Bb. These all result in a 3:1 ratio of black to white. However, the question is phrased as \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" It may be implying that multiple options are correct, but since the user instruction says to answer with a single letter, I think only one option is correct. Wait, no\u2014the options include multiple possible correct answers, but maybe the most likely refers to which combination is possible. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nLet me re-examine the options. The question is about the most likely, so perhaps only one option is correct. Let me check the initial setup again. The problem states that two guinea pigs have black coats. Now, in dihybrid crosses, the classic 9:3:3:1 ratio comes into play, but here it's a single gene. The key point is that the ratio is 3:1, which occurs when the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other homozygous recessive (bb).\n\nIn this problem, the parents could be Bb \u00d7 Bb, BB \u00d7 Bb, BB \u00d7 bb, or bb \u00d7 BB, etc., but all these would result in a 3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options provided, options A, C, E, F, G, H, I are all pairs of Bb and bb (or their reverses), whereas option D is two separate crosses (BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb), which don't affect the overall ratio. Similarly, option B involves mixing different genotypes, which don't lead to the desired ratio.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate answer would be that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option A, or any other combination involving Bb and bb. But since the question is giving specific options, the correct ones are A, C, E, F, G, H, I. However, the user wants only a single letter.

So perhaps the intended answer is A, but considering all possibilities, perhaps any of the options where both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) would be correct. But since the question is about \"most likely,\" and all these pairs are equally likely, but perhaps the best answer is A, as it directly results in the 3:1 ratio without mixing with other genotypes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps only Bb \u00d7 Bb is the correct option, making A the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% BB (black) and 50% bb (white), giving a 50-50 ratio. That doesn't match our 75-25 ratio. So perhaps the parents are heterozygous for the coat color gene.\n\nLooking back at the options where parents are heterozygous, like H (BB \u00d7 Bb), but wait, that's not correct because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have varying genotypes. Alternatively, let me consider the possible parents.\n\nThe observed 3:1 ratio is typical of a dihybrid cross when considering two independent genes, but here it's just a single gene, so it's a monohybrid cross. For a monohybrid cross, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the expected ratio is 3:1 (75% Bb, 25% bb). That fits exactly with the data given: \u00be black, \u00bc white. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to ensure there's no better fit. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (homozygous recessive, all white) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't match our 3:1. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar reasoning: if one parent is bb and the other is BB, the offspring will be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% bb (white), same as above. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B includes multiple possibilities: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. But since the parents must carry the gene, if any parent is BB, it would produce all B alleles, leading to 100% black. However, the problem states both parents are guinea pigs with black coats, implying they are both at least B, so they can't both be BB. Additionally, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 75% Bb and 25% bb, which is a different ratio than 3:1. So option B seems incorrect.\n\nOptions F, G, etc., don't seem relevant unless they're part of another cross. So going back, the correct answer should be parents who are both Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.

BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option F says Bb \u00d7 bb, but that might be part of another cross, not necessarily the parents here. Let me think.\n\nSince both parents produce black-coated offspring, their possible genotypes must allow for at least one dominant allele. If they were both homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb), then all the offspring would be bb, resulting in 100% white coats. But here, some have black and some have white, so neither parent can be homozygous recessive. Therefore, options D (bb \u00d7 bb) and G (BB \u00d7 bb) are incorrect because those would lead to all white or mixed colors, respectively. Wait no\u2014let me clarify:\n\nIf both parents are bb \u00d7 bb, all offspring would be bb, leading to 100% white. But the observed is 75% black and 25% white, so parents aren't both bb. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% BB (black) and 50% bb (white), giving a 50-50 ratio. That doesn't match our 75-25 ratio. So perhaps the parents are heterozygous for the coat color gene.\n\nLooking back at the options where parents are heterozygous, like H (BB \u00d7 Bb), but wait, that's not correct because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have varying genotypes. Alternatively, let me consider the possible parents.\n\nThe observed 3:1 ratio is typical of a dihybrid cross when considering two independent genes, but here it's just a single gene, so it's a monohybrid cross.

So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLet me double-check the other options to ensure there's no better fit. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (homozygous recessive, all white) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't match our 3:1. So option C is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar reasoning: if one parent is bb and the other is BB, the offspring will be 50% Bb (brown) and 50% bb (white), same as above. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption B includes multiple possibilities: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. But since the parents must carry the gene, if any parent is BB, it would produce all B alleles, leading to 100% black. However, the problem states both parents are guinea pigs with black coats, implying they are both at least B, so they can't both be BB. Additionally, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 75% Bb and 25% bb, which is a different ratio than 3:1. So option B seems incorrect.\n\nOptions F, G, etc., don't seem relevant unless they're part of another cross.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, the user provided an answer with some letters, and now I need to choose based on reasoning. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the parents both have black coats, their possible genotypes must allow for at least one dominant allele (B). So, possibilities include BB, Bb, or Bb again because Bb can produce both B and b alleles. But wait, the parents are crossed, so they might be different individuals. Wait no, the parents could be the same or different. For example, a Bb parent crossed with another Bb parent, or a Bb parent crossed with a bb parent, etc.\n\nNow, considering that the offspring have a \u00be black and \u00bc white coat ratio, which corresponds to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. This can happen in several ways depending on the parents:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are homozygous for the dominant allele. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb. When you cross two Bb parents, each gamete will carry a B or a b allele. The Punnett square would show four possible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Among these, \u00be are B (black) and \u00bc are bb (white). That fits exactly with the given data.\n\nCase 2: One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Let's see: BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent produces gametes as follows: BB gives B, and Bb gives B and b. So the Punnett square would have BB (B from BB \u00d7 B from Bb), Bb (B from BB \u00d7 b from Bb), Bb (B from BB \u00d7 b from Bb), and bb (b from Bb \u00d7 b from Bb). So the offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Thus, the phenotypes would be BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), and bb (white). Therefore, \u00be are black, \u00bc white, matching the given data. So this case is also possible.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb,\" which is essentially the same as Case 2. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which is the same as Case 2 as well. Option D is \"bb \u00d7 bb,\" which would all be bb, hence all white. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" \u2013 same as above. Option F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which is the same as Case 2. Option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" same as Case 2. Option I is \"BB \u00d7 bb,\" same as above. Option J is \"BB \u00d7 BB,\" which would give all BB, so all black. So only Cases 1 and 2 fit the given ratio.\n\nSo which of the options represent either Case 1 or Case 2?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 1.\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Case 1.\n\nOptions B and F involve mixed parents, like BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, no\u2014option B is written as \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\" Hmm, maybe that was a typo or misrepresentation. Because when considering multiple parents, typically only two parents are crossed. So perhaps it's supposed to say something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way of saying that the parents are BB and Bb, or BB and bb. Wait, let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"The genotype of the parents were most likely...\"\n\nAnd the options are labeled A to J, but the text seems to indicate that the parents are crossing two pigs, so two parents. Looking at the options, for example, option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which doesn't make sense because you can't have multiple parents crossing together. It should probably be one pair of parents. So perhaps there was a mistake in the formatting, and the intended options are for a single pair. So I'll assume that the options refer to pairs, not separate ones.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the correct pairs are:\n\n- A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 1.\n- C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 2.\n- G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as C.\n- H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as C.\n- I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as C.\n- J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Case 1.\n\nThus, the possible correct answers are A, C, G, H, I, J.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. So any of these pairs would lead to the observed offspring ratio. However, the problem states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. So both parents must have at least one B allele. Which means that for the pairs, both parents are Bb or BB or Bb or bb, but wait, no\u2014if one parent is bb, then the other must contribute a B to get a black pig.\n\nWait, no. If one parent is bb, then the other must be Bb to produce a B gamete. But if one parent is BB, then regardless of the other, all offspring would be BB. Similarly, if both are Bb, then as in Case 1.\n\nSo going back, the possible pairs are those where either both are Bb (Case 1) or one is Bb and the other is bb (Case 2).\n\nLooking at the options, A and J are both Bb \u00d7 Bb, so they fall under Case 1. C, G, H, I are all Bb \u00d7 bb or BB \u00d7 Bb, which falls under Case 2.\n\nHowever, the question is asking which is the most likely genotype of the parents. Since both cases are possible, but which is more likely depends on whether the parents are both Bb or one is Bb and the other is bb.\n\nIn reality, the most common scenario is that both parents are Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio. But sometimes, the parents may differ, such as one being Bb and the other bb. However, without additional information, we cannot determine definitively. But in general, assuming random mating, the most probable genotype pair that leads to a 3:1 ratio is when both parents are Bb, i.e., option A.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, that also results in a 3:1 ratio, so both A and C/G/H/I/J are possibilities. But in the absence of more information, the most straightforward answer is A, Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the parents both have black coats, their possible genotypes must allow for at least one dominant allele (B). So, possibilities include BB, Bb, or Bb again because Bb can produce both B and b alleles. But wait, the parents are crossed, so they might be different individuals. Wait no, the parents could be the same or different. For example, a Bb parent crossed with another Bb parent, or a Bb parent crossed with a bb parent, etc.\n\nNow, considering that the offspring have a \u00be black and \u00bc white coat ratio, which corresponds to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. This can happen in several ways depending on the parents:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are homozygous for the dominant allele. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb. When you cross two Bb parents, each gamete will carry a B or a b allele. The Punnett square would show four possible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Among these, \u00be are B (black) and \u00bc are bb (white). That fits exactly with the given data.\n\nCase 2: One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Let's see: BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent produces gametes as follows: BB gives B, and Bb gives B and b. So the Punnett square would have BB (B from BB \u00d7 B from Bb), Bb (B from BB \u00d7 b from Bb), Bb (B from BB \u00d7 b from Bb), and bb (b from Bb \u00d7 b from Bb). So the offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Thus, the phenotypes would be BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), and bb (white). Therefore, \u00be are black, \u00bc white, matching the given data. So this case is also possible.\n\nBut wait, looking back at the options, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb,\" which is essentially the same as Case 2. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which is the same as Case 2 as well. Option D is \"bb \u00d7 bb,\" which would all be bb, hence all white. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" \u2013 same as above. Option F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which is the same as Case 2. Option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" same as Case 2. Option I is \"BB \u00d7 bb,\" same as above. Option J is \"BB \u00d7 BB,\" which would give all BB, so all black. So only Cases 1 and 2 fit the given ratio.\n\nSo which of the options represent either Case 1 or Case 2?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 1.\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as Case 2.\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Case 1.\n\nOptions B and F involve mixed parents, like BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, no\u2014option B is written as \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\" Hmm, maybe that was a typo or misrepresentation. Because when considering multiple parents, typically only two parents are crossed. So perhaps it's supposed to say something else. Alternatively, perhaps it's a way of saying that the parents are BB and Bb, or BB and bb. Wait, let me check the original question again.\n\nThe user wrote: \"The genotype of the parents were most likely...\"\n\nAnd the options are labeled A to J, but the text seems to indicate that the parents are crossing two pigs, so two parents. Looking at the options, for example, option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which doesn't make sense because you can't have multiple parents crossing together. It should probably be one pair of parents. So perhaps there was a mistake in the formatting, and the intended options are for a single pair. So I'll assume that the options refer to pairs, not separate ones.\n\nTherefore, among the options, the correct pairs are:\n\n- A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 1.\n- C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 Case 2.\n- G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as C.\n- H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as C.\n- I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as C.\n- J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 Case 1.\n\nThus, the possible correct answers are A, C, G, H, I, J.\n\nBut wait, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. So any of these pairs would lead to the observed offspring ratio. However, the problem states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. So both parents must have at least one B allele. Which means that for the pairs, both parents are Bb or BB or Bb or bb, but wait, no\u2014if one parent is bb, then the other must contribute a B to get a black pig.\n\nWait, no. If one parent is bb, then the other must be Bb to produce a B gamete. But if one parent is BB, then regardless of the other, all offspring would be BB. Similarly, if both are Bb, then as in Case 1.\n\nSo going back, the possible pairs are those where either both are Bb (Case 1) or one is Bb and the other is bb (Case 2).\n\nLooking at the options, A and J are both Bb \u00d7 Bb, so they fall under Case 1. C, G, H, I are all Bb \u00d7 bb or BB \u00d7 Bb, which falls under Case 2.\n\nHowever, the question is asking which is the most likely genotype of the parents. Since both cases are possible, but which is more likely depends on whether the parents are both Bb or one is Bb and the other is bb.\n\nIn reality, the most common scenario is that both parents are Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio. But sometimes, the parents may differ, such as one being Bb and the other bb. However, without additional information, we cannot determine definitively. But in general, assuming random mating, the most probable genotype pair that leads to a 3:1 ratio is when both parents are Bb, i.e., option A.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, that also results in a 3:1 ratio, so both A and C/G/H/I/J are possibilities. But in the absence of more information, the most straightforward answer is A, Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb. That might be a typo because usually, each parent's genotype is listed separately, not combined like that. But assuming that's correct, let me think.\n\nThe key here is figuring out the possible combinations of the parents' genotypes that would produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. If the parents are both heterozygous (Bb), then their gametes would be a 50% B and 50% b. Crossing them would give a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. When you test for coat color, since B is dominant, any individual with at least one B will show black. So, in the offspring:\n\n- BB (25%) \u2192 black\n- Bb (50%) \u2192 black\n- bb (25%) \u2192 white\n\nSo, 75% black and 25% white. That matches the observed ratio. Therefore, if both parents are Bb, they should produce the correct ratio. Now, looking back at the options, G says Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see what that gives. The parents would produce gametes of B and b from the first parent, and B from the second. So, the possible combinations are BB, Bb, and BB. Wait, no\u2014actually, the first parent can make B or b, and the second makes B. So the possible offspring are B (from B) and b (from Bb), giving B B and B b. Similarly, from Bb, it's B and b, so the offspring would be B B, B b, and B b. Wait, maybe I should draw a Punnett square. For Bb \u00d7 BB:\n\nParent 1: Bb (genotypes: B and b)\nParent 2: BB (genotypes: B and B)\n\nCrossing these, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, there's a 50% chance of getting B or b, and from Parent 2, 100% B. So, the offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- B (from B) + B = BB\n- b (from B) + B = Bb\n\nSo, the offspring would have a 50% chance of being BB and 50% Bb. Since B is dominant, both BB and Bb would express black. So, 100% black, which doesn't match the observed 75% black. Therefore, option G is incorrect because it results in 100% black, whereas the parents are Bb and BB, leading to 75% black and 25% white.\n\nLooking back, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that produces. The parents are both Bb (wait no, H is BB \u00d7 Bb). Wait, no, H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, Parent 1 is BB (genotypes: B and B), and Parent 2 is Bb (genotypes: B and b). So when crossing, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. From Parent 1, it's always B. From Parent 2, 50% B and 50% b. So the offspring would be:\n\n- B (from B) + B = BB\n- B (from B) + b = Bb\n\nThus, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Both are B alleles, so all would express black. Again, this would result in 100% black, which doesn't fit the observed 75% black.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. That would definitely result in all offspring being bb, meaning all white. Which is even worse than our case.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So, Parent 1 is bb (only b), and Parent 2 is Bb. Their offspring would get either B or b from Parent 2, and b from Parent 1. So the offspring would be Bb (since B is dominant) and bb. Thus, 50% Bb and 50% bb. So, 50% black and 50% white. Which doesn't match the 75/25 ratio.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to Option C, the offspring would be Bb and bb. So again, 50% black and 50% white.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. So, Parent 1 is Bb (B and b), and Parent 2 is bb (only b). Each offspring will receive either B or b from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2. So the offspring would be Bb and bb. So 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Here, Parent 1 is BB (B and B), and Parent 2 is bb (b and b). So each offspring gets B from Parent 1 and b from Parent 2, resulting in Bb. All offspring would be Bb, so all would express black. Again, 100% black.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are BB, so all offspring would be BB. All would be B, hence all black. Also 100% black.\n\nSo reviewing all options, the only one that results in a 3:1 ratio (75% black, 25% white) is when both parents are Bb. Because when Bb crosses Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Among these, BB and Bb are black, while bb is white. So, 75% black and 25% white, matching the observation.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is G, which states Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these might be redundant because they repeat similar possibilities. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, but that's the same as option C being bb \u00d7 Bb. Maybe I should consider each unique pair.\n\nFirst, let's understand why the ratio is \u00be black to \u00bc white. That means that the probability of any offspring inheriting at least one dominant allele (B) is 75%, and the probability of inheriting no dominant alleles is 25%. This can happen in a few ways depending on the parents' genotypes. Let me think about different possible parent combinations:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are heterozygous (Bb). So their gametes are B and b, each at 50%. When they cross, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. The possible combinations are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The bb genotype would lead to white coat color since it's recessive. So the expected ratio would be 1/4 B, 1/2 Bb, and 1/4 bb, translating to 25% B, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That gives 75% B and 25% bb, matching our observed ratio. So parents who are Bb \u00d7 Bb could produce such a ratio.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is when one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). If one parent is BB and the other is bb, then all offspring will get the B allele from the BB parent and the b from the bb parent, resulting in Bb. All would have black coats, giving a 100% black coat ratio. But our case is 75% black, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother case is when one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Then the possible gametes are B (from BB) and Bb (but wait, actually, Bb can produce B or b). Wait, no, the Bb parent can produce B or b gametes. So the Punnett square here would be:\n\nParent1: BB \u2192 gamete B  \nParent2: Bb \u2192 gametes B and b  \n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). The ratios would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 50% B and 50% b (assuming B is dominant), which doesn't match the observed 75% B. So this scenario wouldn't work.\n\nNext, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same as above, leading to 50% B and 50% b. Doesn't fit.\n\nWhat if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb? As I thought earlier, their offspring would have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Which matches the observed 75% B. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking other options to see if there's another possible parent combination that could also result in 75% B and 25% bb.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, that's the same as option H, which is BB \u00d7 Bb. So that's not different; they're just switching the order. Their genotypes are still Bb and BB, so same as before.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see. Parent1 is bb (recessive), so all its gametes are b. Parent2 is BB (homozygous dominant), so gametes are B. So the offspring would always receive one b and one B, making Bb. So all offspring would be Bb, hence all have black coats. That's a 100% B, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. They both are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, meaning all white coats. Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Same as Option E but reversed. Again, all offspring would be Bb, so 100% black.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant, so all offspring would be BB, thus 100% black. Not fitting.\n\nLooking back, the only viable options seem to be Case 1 where both parents are Bb (Options G and H are duplicates), and Cases where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, but that didn't fit the required ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Another way to achieve a 75% B ratio is if one parent is BB and the other is Bb. But we saw that leads to 50% B and 50% bb, which is 50% B and 50% white, not 75% B. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, which results in the 25% B, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio. That fits perfectly. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLet me check if any other combinations could give the same ratio. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the ratio would be 50% B and 50% bb, which is 50% black and 50% white. That's not our case. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, we get the 75% B ratio.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is that both parents are Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these might be redundant because they repeat similar possibilities. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, but that's the same as option C being bb \u00d7 Bb. Maybe I should consider each unique pair.\n\nFirst, let's understand why the ratio is \u00be black to \u00bc white. That means that the probability of any offspring inheriting at least one dominant allele (B) is 75%, and the probability of inheriting no dominant alleles is 25%. This can happen in a few ways depending on the parents' genotypes. Let me think about different possible parent combinations:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are heterozygous (Bb). So their gametes are B and b, each at 50%. When they cross, each offspring gets one allele from each parent. The possible combinations are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The bb genotype would lead to white coat color since it's recessive. So the expected ratio would be 1/4 B, 1/2 Bb, and 1/4 bb, translating to 25% B, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That gives 75% B and 25% bb, matching our observed ratio. So parents who are Bb \u00d7 Bb could produce such a ratio.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is when one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). If one parent is BB and the other is bb, then all offspring will get the B allele from the BB parent and the b from the bb parent, resulting in Bb. All would have black coats, giving a 100% black coat ratio. But our case is 75% black, so that doesn't fit.\n\nAnother case is when one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Then the possible gametes are B (from BB) and Bb (but wait, actually, Bb can produce B or b). Wait, no, the Bb parent can produce B or b gametes. So the Punnett square here would be:\n\nParent1: BB \u2192 gamete B  \nParent2: Bb \u2192 gametes B and b  \n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). The ratios would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 50% B and 50% b (assuming B is dominant), which doesn't match the observed 75% B. So this scenario wouldn't work.\n\nNext, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same as above, leading to 50% B and 50% b. Doesn't fit.\n\nWhat if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb? As I thought earlier, their offspring would have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Which matches the observed 75% B. So that seems correct.\n\nNow, checking other options to see if there's another possible parent combination that could also result in 75% B and 25% bb.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, that's the same as option H, which is BB \u00d7 Bb. So that's not different; they're just switching the order. Their genotypes are still Bb and BB, so same as before.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see. Parent1 is bb (recessive), so all its gametes are b. Parent2 is BB (homozygous dominant), so gametes are B. So the offspring would always receive one b and one B, making Bb. So all offspring would be Bb, hence all have black coats. That's a 100% B, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. They both are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, meaning all white coats. Also doesn't fit.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Same as Option E but reversed. Again, all offspring would be Bb, so 100% black.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant, so all offspring would be BB, thus 100% black. Not fitting.\n\nLooking back, the only viable options seem to be Case 1 where both parents are Bb (Options G and H are duplicates), and Cases where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, but that didn't fit the required ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I missed something. Another way to achieve a 75% B ratio is if one parent is BB and the other is Bb. But we saw that leads to 50% B and 50% bb, which is 50% B and 50% white, not 75% B. So that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, which results in the 25% B, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio. That fits perfectly. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLet me check if any other combinations could give the same ratio. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the ratio would be 50% B and 50% bb, which is 50% black and 50% white. That's not our case. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, we get the 75% B ratio.\n\nTherefore, the most likely answer is that both parents are Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me check why other options are incorrect just to make sure.\n\nOption B: It says BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, that's confusing. The first part is BB \u00d7 BB, which would produce all BB offspring\u2014so 100% black. Then Bb \u00d7 bb produces 3:1, so 75% black and 25% white. If the parents are mixed like that, wouldn't the offspring have varying percentages? Not sure if that's an option, but maybe not relevant here.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb.

Similar to C, but here bb (from one parent) and BB (the other) cross. All offspring would be Bb, which is black. So that gives 100% black, which doesn't match.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. As above, 75% black, 25% white. So this also works. Hmm, so both A and F seem to work. But wait, the options are presented as separate choices, meaning each is a possible answer. However, I think each option describes a single parent and their genotype. Wait no, looking back, the user provided several options labeled A to J, each being a possible pair or description of a pair. Maybe I misinterpreted earlier.\n\nLet me clarify. Each option is a possible set of parent genotypes. For example, Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; Options B and others involve different combinations.

Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the classic case for a 3:1 ratio. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is another valid case.

Let me make sure I understand the possible parent pairs. Each option gives the genotype of one parent and another genotype of the other parent, except for H where it's written twice. Wait, no\u2014looking back, H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb.\" Okay.\n\nSo, first, since both parents have black coats, their genotype possibilities must include at least one dominant allele (B). Because if they had been homozygous recessive (bb), then all their offspring would be bb, which is white, but here 75% are black. So, both parents can't be bb; they must carry at least one dominant allele.\n\nNow, considering the F1 generation (offspring) being \u00be black and \u00bc white, that implies that each parent must contribute at least one dominant allele. If both parents are Bb, then each can produce a B and a b allele, leading to a 25% chance of producing bb (which is white), and 75% chance of producing at least one B (so black). That seems to fit because \u00be * \u00be = 9/16 for black and 4/16 for white, totaling 13/16. But wait, the problem states \u00be and \u00bc, not 9/16 and 4/16. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think about dihybrid crosses or something else. Alternatively, maybe the parents aren't both Bb. Let me consider other possibilities. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the F1 would be B/B and B/b. So, the offspring would receive B from the BB parent and B or b from the Bb parent. Therefore, 75% of the time, they'd get B (from BB) plus whatever the Bb parent gives. Wait, no\u2014if the Bb parent gives either B or b, then the offspring would have either BB (if Bb gives B) or Bb (if Bb gives b). So, the possible genotypes would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%). Then, when calculating coat color, since B is dominant, all those offspring would be black. But the problem says \u00be are black and \u00bc are white, meaning some are showing the recessive phenotype. So, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 would all be BB or Bb, hence all black. This doesn't fit because the problem states some are white.\n\nHmm, okay. What if one parent is BB and the other is bb? Then, the F1 would be all Bb, right? Because BB gives B, and bb gives b, so each offspring gets B and b, making Bb. So, all offspring would be Bb, which is dominant, so all black. Again, this contradicts the problem statement because the offspring should have a mix of black and white.\n\nAnother possibility: Both parents are Bb. As I thought earlier, each parent can give B or b. The probability of getting BB is 25%, Bb is 50%, and bb is 25%. So, in the F1 generation, 75% would be B_, which is black, and 25% would be bb, which is white. So, that matches the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. So, if both parents are Bb, that fits the data.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no\u2014the correct option should be both parents being Bb. Looking at the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is exactly what I just considered. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also leads to all black offspring because BB will always pass on B, and Bb will sometimes pass on B or b. So, the F1 would be B_ and Bb, which are all black. Thus, this wouldn't explain the presence of white-coated animals in the F1.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, which is white. This doesn't match the problem statement.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, the F1 would be Bb, which is all black. So, same issue.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. The F1 would be Bb (since bb gives b, and Bb gives B), so all offspring would be Bb, which is dominant, thus all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. The F1 would be B_ (from Bb) and bb (from bb). So, 75% black (B_) and 25% white (bb). That matches the problem description.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I initially thought both parents being Bb would lead to \u00be black and \u00bc white, which is correct. But according to my previous analysis, both parents being Bb would indeed result in that outcome. However, looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is also correct. But I'm seeing that option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which also results in \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nBut let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, then:\n\nParent 1: Bb\n\nParent 2: Bb\n\nEach can pass on either B or b.\n\nProbability of BB: (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4 \u2192 black\n\nProbability of Bb: 2*(1/2*1/2) = 1/2 \u2192 black\n\nProbability of bb: (1/2)^2 = 1/4 \u2192 white\n\nTotal black: 3/4, white: 1/4.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is bb:\n\nParent 1: Bb\n\nParent 2: bb\n\nOffspring will get B or b from Parent 1, and b from Parent 2.\n\nThus, offspring genotypes: Bb (B from Parent 1 + b from Parent 2) \u2192 all black.\n\nTherefore, the F1 would be all Bb, so all black.\n\nBut the problem states that some F1 are black and some are white. So, the correct parents must allow for some white offspring.\n\nThis means both parents must contribute the recessive allele. So, both parents must be heterozygous (Bb).\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the F1 would have a mix. Let's see: Parent 1 is Bb, Parent 2 is BB.\n\nEach parent can pass either B or b (for Bb) or B (for BB).\n\nSo, offspring would be:\n\nFrom Parent 1: B or b\n\nFrom Parent 2: B (since BB always passes B)\n\nSo, possible genotypes: BB (if B from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2) or Bb (if b from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2).\n\nThus, 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black, since B is dominant). So, that also results in \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nAh, so both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 BB would result in the observed ratio.\n\nBut looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is incorrect because it produces all black.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option F was correct, but upon re-examining, option F does produce \u00be black and \u00bc white, whereas option G does too.\n\nHowever, the question asks for the most likely genotype pair among the options. So, both G and F seem to satisfy the conditions. But I need to check the options again.\n\nWait, no\u2014I made a mistake earlier. When both parents are Bb, the F1 are \u00be B_, \u00bc bb. When one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the F1 are \u00be BB, \u00bc Bb, all black. When one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all F1 are Bb, which is black. So, the only cases where we get both black and white are when both parents are Bb (option G) or when one parent is Bb and the other is BB (option F). But looking at the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is incorrect because it produces all black.\n\nWait, but if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then F1 are all BB or Bb, which are all black. So, that doesn't produce any white offspring. Only when both parents are Bb, or one is Bb and the other is BB, you get a mixture. But wait, earlier I thought that if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the F1 would still be all B_, but that's not correct because the other parent always gives B. So, the F1 would be \u00be BB (from B_ from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2) and \u00bc Bb (from b from Parent 1 and B from Parent 2). All of these are B_, so all black.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get a mix is if both parents are Bb (option G) or if one parent is Bb and the other is BB (but that still results in all black). Wait, but that's conflicting because I thought option F was correct, but upon closer examination, option F doesn't produce white.\n\nWait, no. Let me clarify. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the F1 would be:\n\n- From BB: always B.\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSo, each F1 receives either B or b from Bb and B from BB.\n\nThus, the F1 genotypes would be:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from b and B)\n\nBoth of these are B_, so all black. Hence, no white offspring. So, option F cannot be correct because it doesn't produce any white animals.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the F1 would be 75% B_ and 25% bb, resulting in \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nTherefore, the only correct answer among the options is option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option F also works, but after reconsideration, option F doesn't work because it produces all black. So, the correct answer must be option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white).

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. But the way the question is phrased is \"genotypes of the parents were most likely,\" implying that there's one correct pair among the options.\n\nLet me think about possible parent combinations. If both parents are heterozygous (like A or H), then their offspring will follow a 3:1 ratio. That's because each parent can contribute either the dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele. For example, if both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square would be:\n\nB | b  \nB | BB  \nb | Bb  \nSo the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). When considering coat color, BB and Bb produce black, while bb produces white. So, indeed, the ratio would be \u00be black and \u00bc white. That fits perfectly with the problem statement. So, any combination where both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) should result in this outcome. Looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Oh, wait, I might have mixed up some letters here. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB  \nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nAnd others like D and E involve BB and Bb or bb and Bb.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, any cross between two heterozygotes (like A or H) results in a 3:1 ratio. However, let me double-check whether the genotype combinations in the options match that. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which as I calculated gives BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So that would fit. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: BB is homozygous dominant, so all its offspring would be BB. Bb is heterozygous, so their offspring would be 50% B and 50% b. Therefore, the possible genotypes in the offspring would be BB (from BB \u00d7 Bb), Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 Bb), and bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb). Then, when considering coat color, BB and Bb give black, and bb gives white. So the phenotypic ratio would be \u00be black : \u00bc white. Thus, both option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in a 3:1 ratio. But wait, the question asks which is the most likely genotype pair. Maybe there's something else I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at the parents' possibilities: If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then their offspring would definitely show the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would also have a 3:1 ratio. Because when you cross a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb), all the offspring would inherit at least one B allele, making them all BB or Bb, which are both dominant and thus black. So the ratio would still be \u00be black and \u00bc white. Therefore, both A and H would result in the same ratio. But in the options provided, they are separate answers. Hmm, maybe I need to consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents cannot both be heterozygotes because sometimes in certain cases, the recessive phenotype takes precedence even if not all individuals are showing it. But in this case, the parents are both carriers of the recessive trait, so their children should reflect that. Another possibility is that if both parents are heterozygous, the expected ratio is 3:1, which matches the problem description. So that would suggest that options A and H are both valid. But since the question expects a single answer, perhaps I need to look more closely at the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options include F, which is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me calculate that. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the possible gametes are B and b. So the offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). Since Bb is dominant, those would express black, and bb would express white. So the ratio would be 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit the problem's description of \u00be black and \u00bc white. Therefore, F is incorrect. Similarly, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see: the parents are Bb and BB. The gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring would be BB (50%) and Bb (50%). As before, that would result in 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit. So G is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option D is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Not matching. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Offspring would be Bb and bb. Again, 50% black and 50% white. Incorrect. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as D. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, similar to G and E. Option B includes BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Well, that seems like multiple different crosses, but perhaps it's just an option to trick someone into thinking there are multiple possibilities, but in reality, the parents are likely to be Bb \u00d7 Bb or BB \u00d7 Bb, depending on whether one is homozygous dominant.\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So if the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), that would lead to the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the ratio is also 3:1. But the problem states that both parents are guinea pigs, both with black coats. The fact that both parents are carriers (heterozygous) makes sense because if they were both homozygous dominant, they'd all express the dominant phenotype, which doesn't fit the problem's \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. So, the parents must be heterozygous, leading us back to either A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but looking at option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, let's calculate the offspring. Parent 1 is BB, which always gives B. Parent 2 is Bb, giving B and b. So the offspring would be B (from BB \u00d7 B) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 b). Wait, no\u2014if the first parent is BB and the second is Bb, then each gamete from BB is B, and each gamete from Bb is B and b. So the offspring would get either B from the first parent and B/b from the second. So the possible genotypes are BB (from BB \u00d7 B) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 b). Both BB and Bb are dominant, so they'll all express black. Therefore, the ratio would be 100% black, which doesn't match the 75% observed. So option H is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only viable option is A, where both parents are Bb, resulting in a 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. But the way the question is phrased is \"genotypes of the parents were most likely,\" implying that there's one correct pair among the options.\n\nLet me think about possible parent combinations. If both parents are heterozygous (like A or H), then their offspring will follow a 3:1 ratio. That's because each parent can contribute either the dominant (B) or recessive (b) allele. For example, if both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square would be:\n\nB | b  \nB | BB  \nb | Bb  \nSo the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). When considering coat color, BB and Bb produce black, while bb produces white. So, indeed, the ratio would be \u00be black and \u00bc white. That fits perfectly with the problem statement. So, any combination where both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) should result in this outcome. Looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Oh, wait, I might have mixed up some letters here. Let me check the options again:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB  \nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nAnd others like D and E involve BB and Bb or bb and Bb.\n\nBut according to my earlier analysis, any cross between two heterozygotes (like A or H) results in a 3:1 ratio. However, let me double-check whether the genotype combinations in the options match that. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which as I calculated gives BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So that would fit. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: BB is homozygous dominant, so all its offspring would be BB. Bb is heterozygous, so their offspring would be 50% B and 50% b. Therefore, the possible genotypes in the offspring would be BB (from BB \u00d7 Bb), Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 Bb), and bb (from Bb \u00d7 Bb). Then, when considering coat color, BB and Bb give black, and bb gives white. So the phenotypic ratio would be \u00be black : \u00bc white. Thus, both option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in a 3:1 ratio. But wait, the question asks which is the most likely genotype pair. Maybe there's something else I'm missing.\n\nLooking back at the parents' possibilities: If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then their offspring would definitely show the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would also have a 3:1 ratio. Because when you cross a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb), all the offspring would inherit at least one B allele, making them all BB or Bb, which are both dominant and thus black. So the ratio would still be \u00be black and \u00bc white. Therefore, both A and H would result in the same ratio. But in the options provided, they are separate answers. Hmm, maybe I need to consider another approach.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents cannot both be heterozygotes because sometimes in certain cases, the recessive phenotype takes precedence even if not all individuals are showing it. But in this case, the parents are both carriers of the recessive trait, so their children should reflect that. Another possibility is that if both parents are heterozygous, the expected ratio is 3:1, which matches the problem description. So that would suggest that options A and H are both valid. But since the question expects a single answer, perhaps I need to look more closely at the options.\n\nWait, looking back, the options include F, which is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me calculate that. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the possible gametes are B and b. So the offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). Since Bb is dominant, those would express black, and bb would express white. So the ratio would be 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit the problem's description of \u00be black and \u00bc white. Therefore, F is incorrect. Similarly, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see: the parents are Bb and BB. The gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring would be BB (50%) and Bb (50%). As before, that would result in 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't fit. So G is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, option D is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so all black. Not matching. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Offspring would be Bb and bb. Again, 50% black and 50% white. Incorrect. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as D. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, similar to G and E. Option B includes BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Well, that seems like multiple different crosses, but perhaps it's just an option to trick someone into thinking there are multiple possibilities, but in reality, the parents are likely to be Bb \u00d7 Bb or BB \u00d7 Bb, depending on whether one is homozygous dominant.\n\nWait, actually, the question says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So if the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), that would lead to the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the ratio is also 3:1. But the problem states that both parents are guinea pigs, both with black coats. The fact that both parents are carriers (heterozygous) makes sense because if they were both homozygous dominant, they'd all express the dominant phenotype, which doesn't fit the problem's \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. So, the parents must be heterozygous, leading us back to either A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but looking at option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, let's calculate the offspring. Parent 1 is BB, which always gives B. Parent 2 is Bb, giving B and b. So the offspring would be B (from BB \u00d7 B) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 b). Wait, no\u2014if the first parent is BB and the second is Bb, then each gamete from BB is B, and each gamete from Bb is B and b. So the offspring would get either B from the first parent and B/b from the second. So the possible genotypes are BB (from BB \u00d7 B) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 b). Both BB and Bb are dominant, so they'll all express black. Therefore, the ratio would be 100% black, which doesn't match the 75% observed. So option H is incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only viable option is A, where both parents are Bb, resulting in a 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of those might be redundant because option B lists two separate crosses, while others just describe different possible parent combinations. But since the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, perhaps each parent's genotype can be inferred based on the observed phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet me think about the expected outcomes for various parent pairs:\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive. All offspring would get bb from each parent, so all would express the recessive trait (white). That gives a 100% white coat, which doesn't match our data here. So D is unlikely.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. One parent is homozygous recessive, the other is heterozygous. The offspring will receive b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So the possible gametes are B (25%) and b (75%). Thus, the phenotypes would be B (dominant, black) and b (recessive, white). The ratio would be 3:1, which matches our data perfectly. So C seems promising.\n\nBut wait, let's check other options as well. Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. This is the same as option C, just swapped. So regardless of who is which parent, the outcome would be 3:1. So both C and F are correct in terms of producing the 3:1 ratio. However, the question asks for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Since both C and F involve one parent being homozygous recessive and the other being heterozygous, they produce the same ratio. But looking back at the options, option C is written as bb \u00d7 Bb, whereas option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Depending on the order, it's still the same pair of genotypes.\n\nNow, looking at the other options. Option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Here, one parent is Bb (hetero) and the other is BB (homo homo dominant). The offspring would get B from the BB parent and B or b from the Bb parent. So all would have BB, resulting in a 100% black coat. Again, not matching the data.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option C, but the parents are swapped. So the same 3:1 ratio occurs.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Same as option C. Offspring would get B from the Bb parent and B from the BB parent, making all BB, leading to 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Same as option C and E; all offspring would be Bb, giving 3:1.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both are homozygous dominant. All offspring would be BB, so 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo among all the options, C and F (which are essentially the same as C due to switching parents) produce a 3:1 ratio, which aligns with the data given. Now, looking back at the answer choices, option C is written as bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. They represent the same genotype pair but in opposite orders. Therefore, both C and F would be correct, but since the options don't allow multiple correct answers, I need to see if there's an issue here. Wait, no, the user provided the options, and in the initial description, each letter represents a specific possibility. Looking back, option C is indeed listed, and option F is another way to write the same thing, so both C and F would be correct, but the options don't combine them. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, another angle: the 3:1 ratio implies that the parents must produce a 3/4 chance of giving the dominant allele and 1/4 of giving the recessive. For this to happen, one parent must be homozygous dominant (BB), and the other must be heterozygous (Bb). Because when you cross BB with Bb, all offspring get B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So all would be BB (if B is dominant) or Bb (if the Bb parent contributes b). Wait, no\u2014if the Bb parent is contributing b, then the offspring would have B from the BB parent and b from the Bb parent, making Bb. If the Bb parent contributes B, then all offspring are BB. So the probability of getting Bb is 50%, and BB is also 50%. Wait, that's not 3:1. Oh, I see my mistake earlier. When you cross Bb (hetero) with BB (homo), all offspring should be Bb. Because the Bb parent can only contribute B or b, and the BB parent will always give B. So all offspring will be Bb, resulting in 100% Bb. Then why does the data show 3:1?\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe I misapplied the cross. Let me clarify: If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, their offspring would all be Bb, right? Because the BB parent always contributes B, and the Bb parent can contribute B or b. So the offspring would all be Bb, meaning all would have B, hence all black. Which contradicts the data given where 75% are black and 25% are white.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Earlier, I thought that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would produce 3:1, but according to this new analysis, option C would produce 100% Bb (since BB parent always gives B, and Bb parent can give B or b, so all offspring would have B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So all offspring would be Bb, meaning 100% black. That contradicts the 75% black and 25% white ratio. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the cross wrong. Let me re-examine it. If one parent is bb (recessive) and the other is Bb (hetero), then the offspring would get b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So half the time, they'd get Bb (phenotype black) and half the time, they'd get bb (phenotype white). Hence, a 3:1 ratio, 75% black, 25% white. That makes sense. So in this case, the parents would have been bb (recessive) and Bb (hetero), resulting in a 3:1 ratio. So option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would be the correct parents.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the cross between Bb and Bb, that would result in all offspring being Bb, hence 100% black, which doesn't fit the data. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 bb would produce the same 3:1 ratio. So why did I initially think that option C would produce a 3:1 ratio?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me clarify: If one parent is bb (recessive) and the other is Bb (hetero), the offspring would get b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So 50% chance of Bb (black) and 50% chance of bb (white). Hence, 3:1 ratio. So yes, option C would lead to that.\n\nBut earlier, when considering option F (Bb \u00d7 bb), the same happens. So both options C and F would produce the 3:1 ratio. However, looking back at the question, the options include C and F as separate possibilities. But in reality, they represent the same genetic pair, just ordered differently. So depending on the parent order, the parents could be Bb and bb, or bb and Bb. Either way, the genotype pair remains the same. So the parents would be one homozygous recessive (bb) and one heterozygous (Bb).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C or F, but since they're the same, I need to check the options again. Option C is written as 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' They are the same, just reversed. So both C and F are valid, but the question allows only one answer. Hmm, perhaps I overlooked something else.\n\nWait, another point: the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype of the parents. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then the offspring are 3:1. Similarly, if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, it's the same. So either option C or F is correct. But looking back at the answer options, option C is 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' Since they are the same, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that would produce a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that leads to all black. Or if one is Bb and the other is Bb, all offspring are Bb, 100% black. So that's incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that's not an option here. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 25% B and 75% Bb, leading to 3:1. No, that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: the parents are crossing two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black is dominant, white is recessive. The offspring are \u00be black, \u00bc white. So the parents must be such that when crossed, one produces the necessary alleles to create this ratio.\n\nFrom what I understand, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is when one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). So the parents must be bb and Bb. Therefore, the correct genotype pair is either option C or F. But since the options don't allow for combining, perhaps the answer is C: bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the answer options, option C is listed as 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' They are the same. So both are correct, but since the question expects a single-letter answer, perhaps either is acceptable, but more accurately, the correct genotype pair is bb and Bb.

Which contradicts the data given where 75% are black and 25% are white.\n\nHmm, this is conflicting. Earlier, I thought that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would produce 3:1, but according to this new analysis, option C would produce 100% Bb (since BB parent always gives B, and Bb parent can give B or b, so all offspring would have B from the BB parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So all offspring would be Bb, meaning 100% black. That contradicts the 75% black and 25% white ratio. So maybe I was wrong earlier.\n\nWait, perhaps I got the cross wrong. Let me re-examine it. If one parent is bb (recessive) and the other is Bb (hetero), then the offspring would get b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So half the time, they'd get Bb (phenotype black) and half the time, they'd get bb (phenotype white). Hence, a 3:1 ratio, 75% black, 25% white. That makes sense. So in this case, the parents would have been bb (recessive) and Bb (hetero), resulting in a 3:1 ratio. So option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would be the correct parents.\n\nBut earlier, when I considered the cross between Bb and Bb, that would result in all offspring being Bb, hence 100% black, which doesn't fit the data. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 bb would produce the same 3:1 ratio. So why did I initially think that option C would produce a 3:1 ratio?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake in the earlier analysis. Let me clarify: If one parent is bb (recessive) and the other is Bb (hetero), the offspring would get b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So 50% chance of Bb (black) and 50% chance of bb (white). Hence, 3:1 ratio. So yes, option C would lead to that.\n\nBut earlier, when considering option F (Bb \u00d7 bb), the same happens. So both options C and F would produce the 3:1 ratio. However, looking back at the question, the options include C and F as separate possibilities. But in reality, they represent the same genetic pair, just ordered differently. So depending on the parent order, the parents could be Bb and bb, or bb and Bb. Either way, the genotype pair remains the same. So the parents would be one homozygous recessive (bb) and one heterozygous (Bb).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be C or F, but since they're the same, I need to check the options again. Option C is written as 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' They are the same, just reversed. So both C and F are valid, but the question allows only one answer. Hmm, perhaps I overlooked something else.\n\nWait, another point: the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype of the parents. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then the offspring are 3:1. Similarly, if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, it's the same. So either option C or F is correct. But looking back at the answer options, option C is 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' Since they are the same, perhaps the intended answer is option C. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that would produce a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that leads to all black. Or if one is Bb and the other is Bb, all offspring are Bb, 100% black. So that's incorrect.\n\nAnother possibility: If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that's not an option here. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 25% B and 75% Bb, leading to 3:1. No, that's not applicable here.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement: the parents are crossing two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black is dominant, white is recessive. The offspring are \u00be black, \u00bc white. So the parents must be such that when crossed, one produces the necessary alleles to create this ratio.\n\nFrom what I understand, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is when one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). So the parents must be bb and Bb. Therefore, the correct genotype pair is either option C or F. But since the options don't allow for combining, perhaps the answer is C: bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back, in the answer options, option C is listed as 'bb \u00d7 Bb,' and option F is 'Bb \u00d7 bb.' They are the same. So both are correct, but since the question expects a single-letter answer, perhaps either is acceptable, but more accurately, the correct genotype pair is bb and Bb. So the answer should be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nWait, some of these might not make sense because in option B, there are two different crosses happening\u2014BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. That seems odd because why would the parents be making multiple crosses? Unless they're testing a hypothesis where certain combinations lead to specific outcomes. But the way the question is phrased, it says \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So maybe I can ignore some options based on their wording. Let me think step by step.\n\nFirst, since the phenotype is \u00be black and \u00bc white, the possible genotypes for each parent must allow for this outcome when crossed. If both parents are homozygous (like BB or bb), then their offspring will all be homozygous as well. For example, if both parents are BB, all their offspring will be BB (homozygous dominant, showing black coat). Similarly, if both are bb, all offspring will be bb (homozygous recessive, white coat). But wait, in this case, we don't get all black or all white; instead, it's \u00be black and \u00bc white. So that rules out options D and J, which are bb \u00d7 bb, because then all offspring would be bb, resulting in 100% white coats. Option D would produce 100% white, but here we have 75% black and 25% white. So D is incorrect.\n\nOption J is also bb \u00d7 bb, same issue as D. So D and J can be eliminated. Now, looking at option B, which is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, that doesn't seem right. The parents should be paired together, not split into pairs. So perhaps the intended setup was only one cross, like BB \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because the question states \"two guinea pigs,\" implying a single cross between them. So maybe option B is mixing up scenarios, perhaps it's supposed to be just one cross, not two separate ones. So I'll assume that the correct answer involves a single cross between two animals, meaning that the parents are listed together, not in pairs.\n\nSo moving forward, let's consider each remaining option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then using a Punnett square, the expected ratios would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Translating to coat colors, since B is dominant, BB and Bb would give black, and bb would give white. So the expected ratio would be 75% black and 25% white. This matches exactly the data given in the problem. So this seems promising.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). The possible gametes from the bb parent are all b, and from the Bb parent, they can produce B or b. So the offspring genotypes would be Bb (from Bm and m) and bb (from Bm and m). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white, which fits the problem's description. However, the parents themselves are bb and Bb. So this could be another possibility. But let's see other options to see if there are better fits.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic applies. bb produces all b gametes, and BB produces all B gametes. So offspring are all Bb, which results in black coats. Thus, all offspring would be black, giving a 100% black coat ratio. But our data shows 75% black and 25% white, so this doesn't fit.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as option E. All offspring would be Bb, leading to 100% black coats. Doesn't match the data.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. One parent is BB (homozygous dominant), and the other is Bb (heterozygous). Following the same logic as option C, the offspring would be Bb and bb. So 75% black, 25% white. So this is another possibility.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Again, one parent is BB (homozygous dominant), and the other is bb (homozygous recessive). The offspring would be all Bb, resulting in 100% black coats. Doesn't match the data.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. As discussed earlier, this would result in all offspring being BB, hence 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nNow, back to option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. We've already established that this leads to 75% black and 25% white, matching the problem statement. So this is a valid possibility.\n\nWhat about option C: bb \u00d7 Bb? This also leads to 75% black and 25% white. So both options A and C are possibilities. Wait, but the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. Are there any additional clues?\n\nIn option A, both parents are Bb, which is a common dihybrid cross setup. In option C, one parent is bb, which is homozygous recessive, and the other is Bb. The problem doesn't specify whether the parents are both heterozygous or one is homozygous. Both cases can theoretically produce the observed ratio. So why are there two options now?\n\nLooking back at the original question, it specifies that the parents were crossed, so maybe it's considering a dihybrid cross, but actually, in this case, it's a monohybrid cross since there's only one gene involved. So both A and C could potentially explain the 3:1 ratio. But let me check if the parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb would result in more than just 3:1. No, because in a dihybrid cross (with two genes), you'd get 9:3:3:1, but here we're dealing with a single gene. Wait, no\u2014the question is about a single gene, so the parents are both monoallelic or something else.\n\nWait, the problem mentions \"a cross between two guinea pigs\", which usually implies a single gene. So a dihybrid cross isn't applicable here\u2014it's a monohybrid cross. So both parents could be Bb, making a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, one parent could be bb and the other Bb, which also makes a 3:1 ratio. So both options A and C could lead to the desired ratio. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype of the parents. Are there any other factors to consider?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making the ratio 3:1, whereas if one is bb and the other is Bb, it's still 3:1. So both A and C are equally valid. But let's check the options again. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back at the problem, the parents are \"most likely\" to have had certain genotypes. Maybe there's an assumption that one parent is homozygous and the other is heterozygous. Or perhaps the parents are considered to be both heterozygotes. Without more information, both A and C could be correct. But in reality, both scenarios yield the same 3:1 ratio, so the question expects us to choose between them based on additional criteria.\n\nWait, but looking at the options provided, both A and C are present. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nAre both possibilities valid? Yes, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and bb \u00d7 Bb can produce a 3:1 ratio. So why are these presented as separate options? Perhaps the question is expecting us to recognize that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, as that's a more straightforward scenario without involving a homozygous recessive parent.\n\nBut wait, the problem doesn't specify anything about the parents being of different genotypes. It just says \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So technically, both A and C are possible. However, often in such questions, the answer is the one where both parents are heterozygous, i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb, because that's the typical setup unless stated otherwise. Additionally, in some textbooks, the standard example for a 3:1 ratio is a dihybrid cross between two heterozygotes, but here it's a single gene.

So perhaps it's more efficient to consider each possible pair as separate options.\n\nNow, thinking about the Punnett square approach. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), then each will produce gametes with either B or b, each at a 50% chance. When they combine, the possible genotypes are:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). But since B is dominant, all those would express as black. However, wait\u2014the problem states that \u00be have black, meaning 25% should have white. That doesn't add up because in a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, 25% are bb (white), which aligns with the data here. Wait no, hold on\u2014no, in a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, all offspring would be B_ (either BB or Bb), which are all black. So why does the problem say \u00be have black and \u00bc have white? Because maybe the parents aren't both Bb. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, suppose one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Then when they mate, the possible offspring would be:\n\nFrom the bb parent: all bb (white).\n\nFrom the Bb parent: 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nSo combining both, there would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb + bb = 50% white. Wait, that gives a 50-50 ratio, not 75-25. Hmm, that's different than the problem statement.\n\nWait another possibility: what if both parents are Bb? Then the possible offspring are:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). All being B_, so all black. That wouldn't explain the 75-25 split. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is BB. Let me see:\n\nParent 1: Bb (so can give B or b)\n\nParent 2: BB (can only give B)\n\nSo the offspring will all be B_. Therefore, 100% black. Doesn't fit the 75-25.\n\nAnother possibility: One parent is Bb, and the other is Bb. We've already considered that, leading to 25% bb (white). That matches the 25% white and 75% black ratio. So if the parents are both Bb, the ratio would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white. That fits the problem statement perfectly.\n\nLet me confirm: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Since B_ is black, all these are black. Only the bb genotype results in white.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, looking back, some of these might be duplicates. For example, option B lists two pairs of parents. So perhaps it's more efficient to consider each possible pair as separate options.\n\nNow, thinking about the Punnett square approach. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), then each will produce gametes with either B or b, each at a 50% chance. When they combine, the possible genotypes are:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). But since B is dominant, all those would express as black. However, wait\u2014the problem states that \u00be have black, meaning 25% should have white. That doesn't add up because in a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, 25% are bb (white), which aligns with the data here. Wait no, hold on\u2014no, in a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, all offspring would be B_ (either BB or Bb), which are all black. So why does the problem say \u00be have black and \u00bc have white? Because maybe the parents aren't both Bb. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, suppose one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Then when they mate, the possible offspring would be:\n\nFrom the bb parent: all bb (white).\n\nFrom the Bb parent: 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nSo combining both, there would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb + bb = 50% white. Wait, that gives a 50-50 ratio, not 75-25. Hmm, that's different than the problem statement.\n\nWait another possibility: what if both parents are Bb? Then the possible offspring are:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). All being B_, so all black. That wouldn't explain the 75-25 split. So that can't be right.\n\nHmm, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is BB. Let me see:\n\nParent 1: Bb (so can give B or b)\n\nParent 2: BB (can only give B)\n\nSo the offspring will all be B_. Therefore, 100% black. Doesn't fit the 75-25.\n\nAnother possibility: One parent is Bb, and the other is Bb. We've already considered that, leading to 25% bb (white). That matches the 25% white and 75% black ratio. So if the parents are both Bb, the ratio would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white. That fits the problem statement perfectly.\n\nLet me confirm: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Since B_ is black, all these are black. Only the bb genotype results in white. So indeed, 75% black, 25% white. That matches exactly what the problem says.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB.\n\nBut wait, earlier I thought that if both parents are Bb, their offspring would all be B_ (black). So that should match.\n\nWait, but in my initial analysis, I considered that if both parents are Bb, the ratio is 3:1 (black:white = 3:1). So yes, that fits.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be option C, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Alternatively, Option G is also Bb \u00d7 BB, but that would lead to all B_ (black), same as Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, no. Wait, let me clarify the options.\n\nOptions:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ.

So that would give 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the problem's 75-25 ratio. Similarly, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would only produce all bb offspring, meaning all white, so that's no good. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, similar to C; the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, leading to 50% black and 50% white. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, same as above. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. The F1 would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. So again, 50% black and 50% white. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same issue. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which would all be BB, hence all black. So the only pair that produces 75% black and 25% white is when both parents are Bb. Therefore, the correct answer should be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nHmm, okay, so I need to figure out which pair of parents will produce \u00be black and \u00bc white offspring when crossed. Since there are two parents, their genotype combinations can vary. Let's think about possible scenarios:\n\nFirst, let's consider whether the parents are heterozygotes (like Bb) or homozygous. If both parents are Bb, then the cross would be Bb \u00d7 Bb. When you do that cross, the F1 generation would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, in the case where both parents are Bb, the possible gametes from each parent are B and b, each at 50%. So combining them, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Then, since B is dominant, all those would express as black, except for bb which is white. That gives us 75% black and 25% white, which matches the problem description.\n\nLooking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems like the correct answer because that would produce the required ratio. But let me check why some of the other options might not fit. For example, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (homozygous recessive) and the other is Bb (heterozygote), then the F1 generation would be 50% Bb (dominant) and 50% bb (recessive). So that would give 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the problem's 75-25 ratio. Similarly, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would only produce all bb offspring, meaning all white, so that's no good. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, similar to C; the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, leading to 50% black and 50% white. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, same as above. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb.

But regardless, I need to figure out which pair of parents produces a \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible genetic setups. Since the coat color is determined by a single gene, and the ratio is 3:1, it's probably a dihybrid cross or something else where the parents have different alleles. Wait, but wait, the parents here can only produce gametes based on their own genotype. So, if each parent is homozygous, then all offspring would inherit the same genotype. For example, if both parents are Bb, then every offspring will be Bb, giving 100% black coat, which doesn't match the 75:25 ratio given.\n\nSo, that rules out any parents who are both heterozygous (like option G, H, etc.), since that would lead to all offspring being the same phenotype. Therefore, the correct parents must be heterozygotes, meaning they're both Bb. Let's test that. If each parent is Bb, then when they cross, the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. Using a Punnett square:\n\nParent 1: Bb  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nPossible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. So the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Now, translating that into coat colors: BB and Bb give black (since B is dominant), and bb gives white. So the offspring ratio would be 3:1 (black:white), exactly matching the given data. That fits perfectly.\n\nLet me just make sure I didn't miss anything. What if the parents were different, say one was BB and the other was Bb? Then the possible gametes would be B and Bb \u2192 wait, no. Parent 1 is BB, which can only produce B gametes. Parent 2 is Bb, which can produce B or b. So the possible offspring would be BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (BB:Bb = 1:2 \u2192 3 parts total), which matches. Wait, so does that also fit?\n\nHold on, in this case, the parents would be BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous). So the offspring would be 25% BB and 50% Bb, resulting in a 3:1 ratio. But according to the options, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would not give us this, unless perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, let me check the options again. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB. If the parents are bb and BB, then the gametes from BB are all B, and from bb are all b. So the offspring would be Bb. Since B is dominant, all offspring would have black coats, which would result in a 100% black coat ratio.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, let's analyze each possibility.\n\nFirst, since the coat color is determined by a single gene, the possible genotypes for the parents are either homozygous dominant (BB), homozygous recessive (bb), or heterozygous (Bb). Now, when you cross two heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the F1 generation is all Bb, and the F2 will show a 9:3:3:1 ratio, assuming independent assortment. But here, the ratio is 3:1, not 9:3:3:1, so maybe the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Let's check option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygote), then their offspring would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb), so all offspring would be Bb, meaning 100% black coats. That doesn't match the 75% black and 25% white observed here. So option G is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (recessive homozygote) and the other is Bb (heterozygote), then the offspring would always be Bb, because bb can't contribute any B alleles. Again, all black, same as before. So option C is also incorrect.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive (bb). Then all offspring would be bb, meaning no dominant alleles\u2014so all white coats. This contradicts the observation, so option D is wrong.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is bb, the other is BB. All offspring would be Bb (since bb gives b, BB gives B, so blending into Bb). Therefore, all black. Doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio, so E is out.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. One parent is Bb and the other is bb. When they mate, the offspring would receive either B or b from each parent. Since the bb parent can only give b, the offspring would be Bb (if get B from mom and b from dad) or bb (if get b from mom and b from dad). Wait, no\u2014if mom is Bb and dad is bb, the gametes are B from mom and b from dad. So all offspring would be Bb, meaning all black. Again, 100% black, so F is incorrect.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygote). The offspring would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb), so all Bb, meaning all black. Not matching the 3:1 ratio. So H is incorrect.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. One parent is BB and the other is bb. Offspring would be Bb (since BB gives B and bb gives b). So all Bb, thus all black. So I is incorrect.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant (BB). All offspring would be BB, so all black. So J is incorrect.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Because according to the given data, the ratio is 3:1. That implies that one child has a 75% chance of being Bb and 25% of being bb. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Then all offspring would be Bb, leading to 100% black. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, suppose one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Then the offspring would be Bb and Bb, right? Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then each gamete from BB is B, and from Bb is B and b. So the offspring would get either B or b from the second parent. Wait, actually, when you have two parents where one is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 generation would be:\n\nFrom BB: all B (since they can only pass B).\n\nFrom Bb: half B and half b.\n\nSo the F1 would consist of:\n\n- 1/4 BB (from B from BB and B from Bb)\n\n- 1/4 Bb (from B from BB and b from Bb)\n\n- 1/4 Bb (from B from BB and b from Bb)\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 would be 1/2 B (from Bb) and 1/2 b (from Bb)? No, wait. When you mix a BB and a Bb individual, the F1 would produce:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele. The BB parent will always contribute B, while the Bb parent can contribute B or b. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nBB (from B + B)\n\nBb (from B + b)\n\nBb (from B + b)\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the proportions would be:\n\n- BB: 1/2 * 1 = 1/2 (because the Bb parent can contribute B or b, but since BB always contributes B, the proportion is 1/2 chance of BB and 1/2 chance of Bb.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. The F1 would be:\n\nParent 1: BB \u2192 contributes B\n\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 contributes B or b with equal probability.\n\nSo the F1 genotype distribution is:\n\n- 50% BB (B + B)\n\n- 50% Bb (B + b)\n\nThus, the phenotype ratio would be 3:1 (black:white), since BB is black and Bb is black, whereas bb is white.\n\nAh! So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 BB, the F1 would be 50% BB and 50% Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio. So the parents must be Bb and BB.\n\nLooking back at the options, option I says BB \u00d7 bb, which would lead to all Bb offspring, resulting in 100% black, not fitting the data.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, let's analyze each possibility.\n\nFirst, since the coat color is determined by a single gene, the possible genotypes for the parents are either homozygous dominant (BB), homozygous recessive (bb), or heterozygous (Bb). Now, when you cross two heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the F1 generation is all Bb, and the F2 will show a 9:3:3:1 ratio, assuming independent assortment. But here, the ratio is 3:1, not 9:3:3:1, so maybe the parents aren't both heterozygotes. Let's check option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygote), then their offspring would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb), so all offspring would be Bb, meaning 100% black coats. That doesn't match the 75% black and 25% white observed here. So option G is probably incorrect.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is bb (recessive homozygote) and the other is Bb (heterozygote), then the offspring would always be Bb, because bb can't contribute any B alleles. Again, all black, same as before. So option C is also incorrect.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive (bb). Then all offspring would be bb, meaning no dominant alleles\u2014so all white coats. This contradicts the observation, so option D is wrong.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is bb, the other is BB. All offspring would be Bb (since bb gives b, BB gives B, so blending into Bb). Therefore, all black. Doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio, so E is out.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. One parent is Bb and the other is bb. When they mate, the offspring would receive either B or b from each parent. Since the bb parent can only give b, the offspring would be Bb (if get B from mom and b from dad) or bb (if get b from mom and b from dad). Wait, no\u2014if mom is Bb and dad is bb, the gametes are B from mom and b from dad. So all offspring would be Bb, meaning all black. Again, 100% black, so F is incorrect.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygote). The offspring would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb), so all Bb, meaning all black. Not matching the 3:1 ratio. So H is incorrect.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. One parent is BB and the other is bb. Offspring would be Bb (since BB gives B and bb gives b). So all Bb, thus all black. So I is incorrect.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant (BB). All offspring would be BB, so all black. So J is incorrect.\n\nWait, did I miss something? Because according to the given data, the ratio is 3:1. That implies that one child has a 75% chance of being Bb and 25% of being bb. How does that happen?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Then all offspring would be Bb, leading to 100% black. But that's not the case here. Alternatively, suppose one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Then the offspring would be Bb and Bb, right? Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then each gamete from BB is B, and from Bb is B and b. So the offspring would get either B or b from the second parent. Wait, actually, when you have two parents where one is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 generation would be:\n\nFrom BB: all B (since they can only pass B).\n\nFrom Bb: half B and half b.\n\nSo the F1 would consist of:\n\n- 1/4 BB (from B from BB and B from Bb)\n\n- 1/4 Bb (from B from BB and b from Bb)\n\n- 1/4 Bb (from B from BB and b from Bb)\n\nWait, no. Actually, the F1 would be 1/2 B (from Bb) and 1/2 b (from Bb)? No, wait. When you mix a BB and a Bb individual, the F1 would produce:\n\nEach parent contributes one allele. The BB parent will always contribute B, while the Bb parent can contribute B or b. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nBB (from B + B)\n\nBb (from B + b)\n\nBb (from B + b)\n\nBut since each gamete is equally likely, the proportions would be:\n\n- BB: 1/2 * 1 = 1/2 (because the Bb parent can contribute B or b, but since BB always contributes B, the proportion is 1/2 chance of BB and 1/2 chance of Bb.)\n\nWait, perhaps I should calculate it more accurately. The F1 would be:\n\nParent 1: BB \u2192 contributes B\n\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 contributes B or b with equal probability.\n\nSo the F1 genotype distribution is:\n\n- 50% BB (B + B)\n\n- 50% Bb (B + b)\n\nThus, the phenotype ratio would be 3:1 (black:white), since BB is black and Bb is black, whereas bb is white.\n\nAh! So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 BB, the F1 would be 50% BB and 50% Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio. So the parents must be Bb and BB.\n\nLooking back at the options, option I says BB \u00d7 bb, which would lead to all Bb offspring, resulting in 100% black, not fitting the data. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which leads to all BB, all black. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, all white. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce 25% Bb and 75% bb. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1. Wait, that matches our observation!\n\nWait, earlier I thought that if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be Bb and bb, but no, that's not correct. Wait, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be Bb and bb because the bb parent can only pass b, so the offspring would all be Bb, hence all black. But that doesn't explain the 3:1 ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then all F1 would be Bb, leading to 100% black. Which doesn't fit. So perhaps the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nWait, but hold on. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the F1 would be Bb (from Bb + bb) and bb (from bb + bb). So the F1 would be 50% Bb and 50% bb. Thus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (black:white). That fits the observation.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be Bb (heterozygous) and bb (homozygous recessive). Looking back at the options, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce the correct F1 ratio of 3:1.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option F produces all Bb, which would be 100% black, but now I see that's incorrect. Because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be Bb (since the bb parent can only pass b) and bb. So 50% Bb and 50% bb. Hence, 75% black and 25% white. Yes, that makes sense.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

However, the question is about which pair of parents has the most likely genotype leading to the observed offspring ratio.\n\nSo, the key here is figuring out what cross produces a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when considering the dominance relationships. Let me recall that a 3:1 ratio often comes from a cross where the parents are homozygous for one trait and heterozygous for another. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b. When you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, the F1 generation would be B/B, B/b, b/B, and b/b. The phenotypes would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Wait, no\u2014that gives a 3:1 ratio because 25% + 50% = 75% black and 25% white. That matches the problem statement. Alternatively, if both parents are Bb, their offspring would show 3/4 black and 1/4 white. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all offspring would be Bb (since the bb parent can only give b), resulting in 100% Bb (so all black), which doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the possible offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The BB and bb would be black and white respectively, so that would also give a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014BB is black, Bb is black, and bb is white. So, 75% black and 25% white. So, that's correct too. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, same result. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all offspring are Bb, hence all black. Which doesn't fit.

Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which does produce 75% black and 25% white. Option B includes multiple pairs, like BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Hmm, but the question is about the \"genotypes of the parents\" being most likely. So, if the parents are both Bb, that's option G or H.

Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is our initial case. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which also leads to 75% black. So, which pair is more likely? Or perhaps the question expects us to pick the simplest form, which would be Bb \u00d7 Bb.

But perhaps the correct way is to think in terms of possible parent pairs and their offspring ratios.\n\nSo, first, let me consider the basics. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then when they cross, the expected ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That would give us 1/4 BB, 1/2 Bb, and 1/4 bb as offspring. However, in our case, the phenotypic ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. So the offspring aren't following the typical 1:1 ratio but instead 3:1. This implies that the parents must produce gametes where each can contribute either the dominant or recessive allele in such a way that the combination leads to a majority of dominant traits. Alternatively, maybe the parents are homozygous for the recessive trait, leading to only the recessive phenotype being expressed in all offspring. Wait, no\u2014that wouldn't make sense because the parents themselves would need to carry the recessive allele for that to happen. Or perhaps both parents are heterozygous but in a way that doesn't allow the recessive trait to manifest. Hmm, wait, no\u2014if both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, so the Punnett square would indeed show 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio in coat color. But according to the problem, the offspring have 3/4 black and 1/4 white. So that matches perfectly with a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut let me check another possibility just to be thorough. What if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? Then the possible gametes from the BB parent are all B, and from the Bb parent, it's B and b. The Punnett square would have BB (from BB x B) and Bb (from BB x b), and also Bb (from Bb x B) and bb (from Bb x b). So the genotypes would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Then, since B is dominant, all these would express as black, except for bb, which would be white. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% black and 0% white, which doesn't match the problem statement.

Then the possible gametes are B and b, so the Punnett square would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. As mentioned before, that gives 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem statement.

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb  \nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB  \nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb  \nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB  \nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb  \nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be duplicates because the same parents can appear in different combinations. But perhaps the correct way is to think in terms of possible parent pairs and their offspring ratios.\n\nSo, first, let me consider the basics. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then when they cross, the expected ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That would give us 1/4 BB, 1/2 Bb, and 1/4 bb as offspring. However, in our case, the phenotypic ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. So the offspring aren't following the typical 1:1 ratio but instead 3:1. This implies that the parents must produce gametes where each can contribute either the dominant or recessive allele in such a way that the combination leads to a majority of dominant traits. Alternatively, maybe the parents are homozygous for the recessive trait, leading to only the recessive phenotype being expressed in all offspring. Wait, no\u2014that wouldn't make sense because the parents themselves would need to carry the recessive allele for that to happen. Or perhaps both parents are heterozygous but in a way that doesn't allow the recessive trait to manifest. Hmm, wait, no\u2014if both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, so the Punnett square would indeed show 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio in coat color. But according to the problem, the offspring have 3/4 black and 1/4 white. So that matches perfectly with a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut let me check another possibility just to be thorough. What if one parent is BB and the other is Bb? Then the possible gametes from the BB parent are all B, and from the Bb parent, it's B and b. The Punnett square would have BB (from BB x B) and Bb (from BB x b), and also Bb (from Bb x B) and bb (from Bb x b). So the genotypes would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Then, since B is dominant, all these would express as black, except for bb, which would be white. So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% black and 0% white, which doesn't match the problem statement. So that's not right.\n\nWhat if one parent is BB and the other is bb? Then the possible gametes are B and b. The Punnett square would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%) and bb (25%). Again, since B is dominant, all would show black, so the ratio is 100% black, which is not matching.\n\nAnother option: both parents are BB. Then all offspring would be BB, resulting in 100% black. Not matching.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb: As above, same result\u2014100% black.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is bb: All offspring would have either BB (B from both parents) or Bb (one B and one b).

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo first, I need to figure out possible parent pairs and their offspring outcomes. The key here is that the offspring show a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio, which is 3:1. This typically happens when there are two genes involved where each parent contributes one allele, leading to four possible combinations. But since the outcome is 3:1, maybe it's a monozygotic cross involving a heterozygote and another genotype. Wait, no, because if both parents are heterozygotes (like Bb \u00d7 Bb), then all offspring would be \u00bd Bb and \u00bd bb, resulting in 3:1. Alternatively, if one parent is homozygous dominant (BB) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), then the offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). That would give a 3:1 ratio as well. Hmm, wait\u2014that doesn't match the \u00be black ratio. Because in that case, BB would be 25%, and Bb would be 50%. So total black would be 75% and white 25%. That fits the \u00be:\u00bc ratio. So if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have a \u00be chance of being Bb (heterozygous) and \u00bc chance of being BB (homozygous dominant), hence \u00be black and \u00bc white. So that's a possibility.\n\nLooking back at the options, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me test that. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then each parent can contribute either B or b. So the possible gametes from Bb are \u00bd B and \u00bd b, and from bb it's only bb. So the offspring will get B from Bb and b from bb, making Bb; or b from Bb and b from bb, making bb. So the phenotypes will be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Again, that gives a 3:1 ratio. So both F and H might seem correct, but wait:\n\nWait, no\u2014hold on. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which results in 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white)\u2014so 1:1, not 3:1. Oh, wait, I thought earlier it was 3:1, but now I'm confused. No, wait\u2014the question says three quarters have black, one quarter white. So \u00be black, \u00bc white. So that would imply that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (B), meaning they\u2019re either Bb or BB. And 25% chance of being bb (white).\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then every offspring gets one allele from each parent. Each parent can give either B or b. So the possible combinations are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. So the phenotypes would be BB (black) and Bb/bb (white). The probability of BB is 25%, and Bb/bb is 75%. So 75% black and 25% white. That matches the given ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then the possible offspring are Bb (75%) and bb (25%), same as before. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb. Which is 50% black (Bb) and 50% white (bb). That's a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't fit. Therefore, option F would produce a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So the correct parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb to get \u00be black.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using Punnett squares. For Bb \u00d7 Bb:\n\n- Parent 1: Bb\n- Parent 2: Bb\n\nEach parent can produce B or b alleles. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n   |   B  |   b  \n---|-------|-------\n B | BB   | Bb  \nb | Bb    | bb  \n\nSo the four possible combinations are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb, each with equal probability of 25%. So 25% BB (black) and 75% Bb/bb (white). That's exactly the ratio given.\n\nNow, checking the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see what that would produce. Both parents are Bb and BB. Since BB is homozygous dominant, any gamete it produces is B. The other parent is Bb, which can produce B or b. So the offspring would receive B from BB and either B or b from Bb. Thus, the possible phenotypes are BB (75%) and Bb (25%). So again, 75% black, 25% white. So this also fits the ratio. However, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to the same outcome as Bb \u00d7 Bb. So why are options H and I different?\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's analyze that. Parent 1 is BB, which always gives B. Parent 2 is Bb, giving B or b. So the offspring will get B from BB and either B or b from Bb. So the possible phenotypes are BB (75%) and Bb (25%). Same as above.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Here, one parent is BB (always B), and the other is bb (always b). So the offspring will always get B from BB and b from bb, resulting in Bb. So 100% Bb, which means 100% black. That doesn't fit the 75% black ratio.\n\nSo among the options, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 BB (which is option G) and BB \u00d7 Bb (option H) would produce the desired ratio. However, looking back, the question asks for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So both parents could be Bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, or both could be Bb and bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 bb. Or perhaps one is BB and the other is Bb, making the cross BB \u00d7 Bb. All of these scenarios result in the 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies \"the most likely,\" implying that there's a unique answer. So perhaps the correct answer is C, which is bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014that would give a different ratio. Let me check.\n\nIf one parent is bb (always recessive) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be Bb (75%) and bb (25%). That's 75% black, 25% white. So that fits too. So why is the correct answer listed as option E, which is bb \u00d7 BB?\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me go back. The initial analysis suggested that Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 bb, and BB \u00d7 Bb would all produce a 3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would indeed produce 75% black, 25% white. So why does the question present multiple options?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the question is about the most likely parents. So which pair would result in the observed phenotype ratio. From my previous reasoning, several pairs would work, including Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 bb, and BB \u00d7 Bb. But the options don't include all of these. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. That's correct. Similarly, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. Also correct. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which also works. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which also works. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also works. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which also works.\n\nBut the question is asking for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" It seems like more than one pair would fit. However, perhaps there's an assumption that the parents are both dihybrids or something else. Wait, but the question doesn't specify anything about the number of genes or the parents being monogamous. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are heterozygotes. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nThe options include Bb \u00d7 Bb (A), Bb \u00d7 bb (F), bb \u00d7 Bb (C), bb \u00d7 bb (D), etc. So all except some are possible. But the question asks for the most likely, so perhaps multiple answers are possible, but the options don't allow for that. Maybe I've missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is bb \u00d7 Bb. Alternatively, option E, bb \u00d7 BB. But according to my earlier analysis, both pairs (C and E) would produce a 3:1 ratio. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but the options don't provide that. Wait, looking back at the options, I see that option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Both are correct. But the question lists each as separate options, so perhaps the intended answer is option C, as it's a simpler cross without any parental ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, which is similar to option E. Wait, but both C and E are correct based on the analysis. However, looking at the original problem statement again, the user wrote the options as A to J, and in the final answer, it should be a single letter. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me double-check the Punnett squares for each cross:\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 Bb:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: Bb\nPossible gametes: B and b for each parent.\nCrossing: \nBB (from B and B)\nBb (from B and b)\nBb (from b and B)\nbb (from b and b)\nSo phenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white).\nThus, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 bb:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: bb\nGametes: B and b.\nCrossing:\nBb (from B and bb)\nBb (from b and bb)\nbb (from B and bb)\nbb (from b and bb)\nPhenotypes: Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white), bb (white).\nThus, 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white) \u2192 1:1 ratio.\n\nFor bb \u00d7 Bb:\nSame as Bb \u00d7 bb, just reversed. So same result.\n\nFor bb \u00d7 bb:\nBoth parents are homozygous recessive. Gametes: b from each parent. Cross: bb (100%). Phenotype: white. So 100% white, which doesn't fit.\n\nFor BB \u00d7 Bb:\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: Bb\nGametes: B from BB, B and b from Bb.\nCrossing:\nBB (from B and B)\nBB (from B and b)\nBb (from B and B)\nBb (from b and B)\nPhenotypes: BB (black), BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black).\nThus, 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 BB:\nSame as BB \u00d7 Bb, just reversed. So 100% black.\n\nFor BB \u00d7 bb:\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: bb\nGametes: B and b.\nCrossing:\nBB (from B and bb)\nBb (from B and bb)\nBb (from b and BB)\nbb (from b and bb)\nPhenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white).\nThus, 75% black, 25% white.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 bb:\nAs above, 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white).\n\nFor bb \u00d7 BB:\nSame as BB \u00d7 bb, 75% black, 25% white.\n\nTherefore, the correct pairs are:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb (A)\n- Bb \u00d7 bb (F)\n- bb \u00d7 Bb (C)\n- bb \u00d7 bb (D)\n- BB \u00d7 Bb (H)\n- BB \u00d7 bb (I)\n\nAll of these produce 75% black, 25% white. Now, looking back at the options, the question is asking for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Since multiple pairs fit, but the options are singular letters, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C, bb \u00d7 Bb, because it's a simpler cross without any ambiguity. Alternatively, option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, is also correct.\n\nBut the user specified to choose a single letter, so perhaps the correct answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), as it's a straightforward cross where both parents are heterozygotes, avoiding any complexities.\n\nWait, but in reality, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb (and their reverses) produce the same ratio. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering the problem structure, the intended answer is probably option C, but I'll stick with my analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So the phenotypes will be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Again, that gives a 3:1 ratio. So both F and H might seem correct, but wait:\n\nWait, no\u2014hold on. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which results in 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white)\u2014so 1:1, not 3:1. Oh, wait, I thought earlier it was 3:1, but now I'm confused. No, wait\u2014the question says three quarters have black, one quarter white. So \u00be black, \u00bc white. So that would imply that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (B), meaning they\u2019re either Bb or BB. And 25% chance of being bb (white).\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then every offspring gets one allele from each parent. Each parent can give either B or b. So the possible combinations are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. So the phenotypes would be BB (black) and Bb/bb (white). The probability of BB is 25%, and Bb/bb is 75%. So 75% black and 25% white. That matches the given ratio.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then the possible offspring are Bb (75%) and bb (25%), same as before. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb. Which is 50% black (Bb) and 50% white (bb). That's a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't fit. Therefore, option F would produce a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So the correct parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb to get \u00be black.\n\nAnother way to think about it is using Punnett squares. For Bb \u00d7 Bb:\n\n- Parent 1: Bb\n- Parent 2: Bb\n\nEach parent can produce B or b alleles. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\n   |   B  |   b  \n---|-------|-------\n B | BB   | Bb  \nb | Bb    | bb  \n\nSo the four possible combinations are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb, each with equal probability of 25%. So 25% BB (black) and 75% Bb/bb (white). That's exactly the ratio given.\n\nNow, checking the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see what that would produce. Both parents are Bb and BB. Since BB is homozygous dominant, any gamete it produces is B. The other parent is Bb, which can produce B or b. So the offspring would receive B from BB and either B or b from Bb. Thus, the possible phenotypes are BB (75%) and Bb (25%). So again, 75% black, 25% white. So this also fits the ratio. However, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to the same outcome as Bb \u00d7 Bb. So why are options H and I different?\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's analyze that. Parent 1 is BB, which always gives B. Parent 2 is Bb, giving B or b. So the offspring will get B from BB and either B or b from Bb. So the possible phenotypes are BB (75%) and Bb (25%). Same as above.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Here, one parent is BB (always B), and the other is bb (always b). So the offspring will always get B from BB and b from bb, resulting in Bb. So 100% Bb, which means 100% black. That doesn't fit the 75% black ratio.\n\nSo among the options, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 BB (which is option G) and BB \u00d7 Bb (option H) would produce the desired ratio. However, looking back, the question asks for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So both parents could be Bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, or both could be Bb and bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 bb. Or perhaps one is BB and the other is Bb, making the cross BB \u00d7 Bb. All of these scenarios result in the 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, the question specifies \"the most likely,\" implying that there's a unique answer. So perhaps the correct answer is C, which is bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014that would give a different ratio. Let me check.\n\nIf one parent is bb (always recessive) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be Bb (75%) and bb (25%). That's 75% black, 25% white. So that fits too. So why is the correct answer listed as option E, which is bb \u00d7 BB?\n\nWait, I'm getting conflicting information. Let me go back. The initial analysis suggested that Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 bb, and BB \u00d7 Bb would all produce a 3:1 ratio. But looking at the options, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would indeed produce 75% black, 25% white. So why does the question present multiple options?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify: the question is about the most likely parents. So which pair would result in the observed phenotype ratio. From my previous reasoning, several pairs would work, including Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 bb, and BB \u00d7 Bb. But the options don't include all of these. Looking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. That's correct. Similarly, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. Also correct. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which also works. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which also works. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also works. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which also works.\n\nBut the question is asking for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" It seems like more than one pair would fit. However, perhaps there's an assumption that the parents are both dihybrids or something else. Wait, but the question doesn't specify anything about the number of genes or the parents being monogamous. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are heterozygotes. Let me re-examine the options.\n\nThe options include Bb \u00d7 Bb (A), Bb \u00d7 bb (F), bb \u00d7 Bb (C), bb \u00d7 bb (D), etc. So all except some are possible. But the question asks for the most likely, so perhaps multiple answers are possible, but the options don't allow for that. Maybe I've missed something.\n\nWait, perhaps the correct answer is option C, which is bb \u00d7 Bb. Alternatively, option E, bb \u00d7 BB. But according to my earlier analysis, both pairs (C and E) would produce a 3:1 ratio. So perhaps the correct answer includes both, but the options don't provide that. Wait, looking back at the options, I see that option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Both are correct. But the question lists each as separate options, so perhaps the intended answer is option C, as it's a simpler cross without any parental ambiguity.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, which is similar to option E. Wait, but both C and E are correct based on the analysis. However, looking at the original problem statement again, the user wrote the options as A to J, and in the final answer, it should be a single letter. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option C, but I'm not entirely sure.\n\nWait, let me double-check the Punnett squares for each cross:\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 Bb:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: Bb\nPossible gametes: B and b for each parent.\nCrossing: \nBB (from B and B)\nBb (from B and b)\nBb (from b and B)\nbb (from b and b)\nSo phenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white).\nThus, 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 bb:\nParent 1: Bb\nParent 2: bb\nGametes: B and b.\nCrossing:\nBb (from B and bb)\nBb (from b and bb)\nbb (from B and bb)\nbb (from b and bb)\nPhenotypes: Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white), bb (white).\nThus, 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white) \u2192 1:1 ratio.\n\nFor bb \u00d7 Bb:\nSame as Bb \u00d7 bb, just reversed. So same result.\n\nFor bb \u00d7 bb:\nBoth parents are homozygous recessive. Gametes: b from each parent. Cross: bb (100%). Phenotype: white. So 100% white, which doesn't fit.\n\nFor BB \u00d7 Bb:\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: Bb\nGametes: B from BB, B and b from Bb.\nCrossing:\nBB (from B and B)\nBB (from B and b)\nBb (from B and B)\nBb (from b and B)\nPhenotypes: BB (black), BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black).\nThus, 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 BB:\nSame as BB \u00d7 Bb, just reversed. So 100% black.\n\nFor BB \u00d7 bb:\nParent 1: BB\nParent 2: bb\nGametes: B and b.\nCrossing:\nBB (from B and bb)\nBb (from B and bb)\nBb (from b and BB)\nbb (from b and bb)\nPhenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), Bb (black), bb (white).\nThus, 75% black, 25% white.\n\nFor Bb \u00d7 bb:\nAs above, 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white).\n\nFor bb \u00d7 BB:\nSame as BB \u00d7 bb, 75% black, 25% white.\n\nTherefore, the correct pairs are:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb (A)\n- Bb \u00d7 bb (F)\n- bb \u00d7 Bb (C)\n- bb \u00d7 bb (D)\n- BB \u00d7 Bb (H)\n- BB \u00d7 bb (I)\n\nAll of these produce 75% black, 25% white. Now, looking back at the options, the question is asking for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Since multiple pairs fit, but the options are singular letters, perhaps the intended correct answer is option C, bb \u00d7 Bb, because it's a simpler cross without any ambiguity. Alternatively, option H, BB \u00d7 Bb, is also correct.\n\nBut the user specified to choose a single letter, so perhaps the correct answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), as it's a straightforward cross where both parents are heterozygotes, avoiding any complexities.\n\nWait, but in reality, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb (and their reverses) produce the same ratio. So perhaps the correct answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), but I'm not certain. Alternatively, considering the problem structure, the intended answer is probably option C, but I'll stick with my analysis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats.

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nWait, option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which would give all offspring as BB (black), which doesn't match the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio because they wouldn't have any white animals. So option J can be eliminated right away. Similarly, option I is BB \u00d7 bb. Let me think about each possible pair.\n\nOption A: Both parents are Bb. That means each parent can produce gametes with either B or b. When you cross two Bb parents, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But according to the problem, the ratio is \u00be black to \u00bc white, which corresponds to 75% BB and Bb and 25% bb. Wait, but in this case, the expected ratio would be \u00be BB + \u00bd Bb + \u00bc bb, which is different from the \u00be black and \u00bc white described. Hmm, maybe not. Alternatively, wait, actually, when both parents are Bb, the phenotypic ratio should be 3:1, which matches the problem statement. Because each parent gives B or b, leading to four possible offspring: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Of those, \u00be (BB and Bb) are black and \u00bc (bb) are white. So that seems correct. But let's check the genotype possibilities. If both parents are Bb, then their genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb. So that's option A. But wait, another possibility is option I, which is BB \u00d7 bb. Let me see what that produces. For a cross between BB (homozygous dominant) and bb (homozygous recessive), the offspring will all be Bb (since BB gives B, bb gives b). So all the offspring would be Bb, meaning all black. That contradicts the observed phenotype ratio, so option I is incorrect. Therefore, option A might be correct. But wait, earlier I thought that if parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring would be \u00be BB and \u00bc bb, so that fits the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. So why does option A say \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\"? That sounds correct. But wait, another thought: when both parents are Bb, the possible genotypes are:\n\nParent 1: Bb \u2192 can make B or b\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 can make B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes are B and b each with 50% probability.\n\nThe Punnett square would show:\n\n- B \u00d7 B = BB (25%)\n- B \u00d7 b = Bb (50%)\n- b \u00d7 B = Bb (50%)\n- b \u00d7 b = bb (25%)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio is \u00be BB (black) and \u00bc bb (white), matching the problem description. So option A seems correct. However, let me consider other options too.\n\nOption B: One parent is BB and the other is BB and Bb. Wait, no, option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\". That seems confusingly written. Maybe it's intended to mean that the parents are BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me think: If one parent is BB and the other is BB, then all offspring would be BB. But since there are two BB parents, perhaps it's a dihybrid cross. Wait, no, if one parent is BB and the other is BB \u00d7 Bb, then it's unclear. Perhaps it's an error in the option. Or maybe it's supposed to represent two separate crosses. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to describe parents like BB \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb, but that's not what's written here. So maybe option B is less likely.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. So parent 1 is bb (homozygous recessive), and parent 2 is Bb. The possible gametes from bb are all b, and from Bb, 50% B and 50% b. So the offspring will be:\n\n- b \u00d7 B = Bb\n- b \u00d7 B = Bb\n- b \u00d7 b = bb\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white), which also fits the problem description. So option C would also work. So now I have options A and C as possibilities. Wait, but let's go back. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce \u00be BB and \u00bc bb, hence \u00be black and \u00bc white. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. Both scenarios fit the same phenotype ratio. Now I need to determine which genotype pair leads to that ratio.\n\nWait, but let me think more clearly. Each cross where both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) results in a 3:1 ratio because of the independent assortment and the fact that the alleles are on the same chromosome. On the other hand, a cross between a homozygous recessive (bb) and a heterozygote (Bb) would also lead to a 3:1 ratio, because the bb parent contributes only b alleles, and the Bb parent contributes either B or b. Thus, the offspring would be \u00be Bb (phenotype black) and \u00bc bb (phenotype white), which is exactly the same as the problem's outcome. So both A and C could result in the same phenotype ratio. However, the question asks which genotype pair was used, so I need to figure out whether the parents must be both Bb (option A) or one Bb and one bb (option C).\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would yield \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. Whereas if both parents are Bb, the cross yields \u00be BB and \u00bc bb. Both situations produce the same overall phenotype ratio, so both pairs of parents could theoretically result in the observed data. However, the answer options don't include both A and C together, so perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, no, the options are individual pairs. So the question is which of the provided options correctly describes the parents' genotypes. Looking back, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So both could potentially produce the observed ratio. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which pair was most likely, implying that among the given options, only one is correct. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states that both parents have black coats. So if one parent were bb, their coat would be white. But since both parents have black coats, neither can be bb. Therefore, both parents must contribute B alleles. So in the cross, neither parent can be homozygous recessive (bb). So option B includes a parent who is bb, which would be invalid because the other parent would have to be BB (as per option B, BB \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 bb?), but wait, that's getting complicated. Let me clarify.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be:\n\nParent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: Bb (heterozygous)\n\nThe possible gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nB x B = BB\nB x b = Bb\nb x B = Bb\nb x b = bb\n\nSo the ratio is \u00be BB (black) and \u00bc bb (white), which matches the problem statement. Now, considering the parents, one is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous). This cross would produce the desired phenotype ratio without requiring both parents to be heterozygous (i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb). Hence, option B is a valid possibility. However, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which also works, but the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair. Since both A and B could produce the same phenotype ratio, but the options require selecting one, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of a homozygous recessive (bb) parent precludes the use of option A, because both parents being Bb would allow the 3:1 ratio, while a mix like Bb \u00d7 bb would still allow the same ratio because the bb parent only contributes b alleles. So both options A and B could produce the same ratio, but the presence of a bb parent affects the viability of some crosses. However, in the problem, both parents have black coats, so they cannot be bb. Therefore, the correct pair must consist of two heterozygotes. Hence, option A (both Bb) is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Thus, the offspring would be \u00be Bb (phenotype black) and \u00bc bb (phenotype white), which is exactly the same as the problem's outcome. So both A and C could result in the same phenotype ratio. However, the question asks which genotype pair was used, so I need to figure out whether the parents must be both Bb (option A) or one Bb and one bb (option C).\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would yield \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. Whereas if both parents are Bb, the cross yields \u00be BB and \u00bc bb. Both situations produce the same overall phenotype ratio, so both pairs of parents could theoretically result in the observed data. However, the answer options don't include both A and C together, so perhaps I made a mistake in my analysis.\n\nWait, no, the options are individual pairs. So the question is which of the provided options correctly describes the parents' genotypes. Looking back, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So both could potentially produce the observed ratio. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which pair was most likely, implying that among the given options, only one is correct. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe problem states that both parents have black coats. So if one parent were bb, their coat would be white. But since both parents have black coats, neither can be bb. Therefore, both parents must contribute B alleles. So in the cross, neither parent can be homozygous recessive (bb). So option B includes a parent who is bb, which would be invalid because the other parent would have to be BB (as per option B, BB \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 bb?), but wait, that's getting complicated. Let me clarify.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be:\n\nParent 1: BB (homozygous dominant)\nParent 2: Bb (heterozygous)\n\nThe possible gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nB x B = BB\nB x b = Bb\nb x B = Bb\nb x b = bb\n\nSo the ratio is \u00be BB (black) and \u00bc bb (white), which matches the problem statement. Now, considering the parents, one is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous). This cross would produce the desired phenotype ratio without requiring both parents to be heterozygous (i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb). Hence, option B is a valid possibility. However, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which also works, but the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair. Since both A and B could produce the same phenotype ratio, but the options require selecting one, perhaps I need to reconsider.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct approach is to recognize that the presence of a homozygous recessive (bb) parent precludes the use of option A, because both parents being Bb would allow the 3:1 ratio, while a mix like Bb \u00d7 bb would still allow the same ratio because the bb parent only contributes b alleles. So both options A and B could produce the same ratio, but the presence of a bb parent affects the viability of some crosses. However, in the problem, both parents have black coats, so they cannot be bb. Therefore, the correct pair must consist of two heterozygotes. Hence, option A (both Bb) is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

However, another possibility is a heterozygous parent combined with a homozygous recessive parent. For example, a Bb (heterozygous) parent crossed with a bb parent would result in \u00bd Bb and \u00bd bb.

Hmm, maybe some of these are like double crosses where the first parent produces two types of gametes, then another parent produces two different types, leading to four possible combinations. But I think the problem is more straightforward. Each parent is giving an allele pair, and their combination results in specific offspring ratios.\n\nLet's recall that when you cross two heterozygotes (like Bb \u00d7 Bb), each parent can produce two types of gametes: B and b, each at 50%. When you combine these, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. That gives a 1:2:1 ratio, not matching our 3:1 ratio here. Therefore, option A seems unlikely because it would produce a 1:2:1 ratio, but we have 3:1.\n\nNext, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So the parent with genotype bb can only give b alleles, since they're homozygous recessive. The other parent, Bb, can give either B or b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (if B combines with b) and bb (if b combines with b). Wait, but bb is homozygous recessive, so the phenotype would be white. However, when you cross Bb (which would show black) with bb (which shows white), the expected ratio is 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches our observed data perfectly\u2014three-quarters black and one-quarter white. So option C seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options just to make sure. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring will be bb, meaning all white. That doesn't match any of our ratios. Similarly, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as D; all offspring would be Bb? No, wait, if one parent is bb and the other is BB, then all offspring would get B from BB and b from bb, resulting in Bb, which is black. Again, a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. The parent with Bb can give B or b, and the parent with bb can only give b. So the offspring genotypes would be Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black and bb is white. So the ratio should be 75% black and 25% white, which matches our observation. So why am I considering option F now?\n\nWait, no, because in reality, when you cross a Bb and a bb individual, you get a 3:1 ratio. But in this case, does the cross involve two separate parents? If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then yes, the ratio is 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). So both option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) seem to produce the same ratio. But wait, in the original question, the parents are both guinea pigs, but perhaps one is Bb and the other is bb. Or maybe they're both Bb. Wait, the parents are both Bb and bb? No, wait, the parents can be either same or different genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats.\" So both parents are black, which means their genotypes must be either BB or Bb. Now, the problem asks about the most likely genotypes of the parents. So let's consider all possibilities.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then their cross would yield a 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Which is a 1:2:1 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't match the observed 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). That's exactly the ratio we have. Alternatively, if both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, which would be all black, not matching. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring genotypes would be BB (from BB + B) and Bb (from BB + b and Bb + b). Wait, let me calculate that properly. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the possible gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring would be:\n\nBB (from B and B)\nBB (from B and b)\nBb (from B and b)\nBb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. When you cross BB (genotype B_B_) with Bb (genotype B_b), the possible gametes are B from both parents. So all offspring would be B from BB and B or b from Bb. Wait, no, sorry, let me correct that. The offspring would receive one allele from each parent. So the gamete from BB is B, and the gamete from Bb is B or b. So the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom BB and B: B + B = BB (black)\nFrom BB and b: B + b = Bb (black)\nFrom Bb and B: B + B = BB (black)\nFrom Bb and b: B + b = Bb (black)\n\nWait, that's all black. So that can't explain the 75% black and 25% white. So option D (bb \u00d7 BB) would result in all offspring being Bb (black), which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would indeed produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white), which fits. So option F would also fit. Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct. Let me clarify.\n\nIn my initial analysis, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would also produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). So both options C and F would lead to the desired ratio. But wait, the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Are both options possible, or is there something else to consider?\n\nLooking back at the problem, the parents are both black, so their possible genotypes are either BB or Bb. Now, the possible combinations for the parents are:\n\n1. Both parents are Bb.\n2. One parent is Bb and the other is bb.\n3. Both parents are BB.\n\nNow, the possible offspring ratios for each combination:\n\n1. Both parents Bb: 1:2:1 \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Doesn't match 3:1.\n2. One parent Bb, one parent bb: 3:1 \u2192 75% Bb, 25% bb. Matches.\n3. Both parents BB: 100% BB \u2192 All black. Doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the most likely parents are one being Bb and the other being bb. So the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which leads to a 3:1 ratio. Thus, the correct answer would be either option F or option C, depending on whether the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, but earlier I thought option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) is the same as option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) because multiplication is commutative. So both options are essentially the same in terms of outcome.\n\nWait, but the way the options are presented, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. They are the same cross, so both would produce the same ratio. However, in the context of the problem, the parents are two guinea pigs, both black. So they could either both be Bb or one could be Bb and the other bb.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios are possible, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Since the parents are both black, the most general case is that one is Bb and the other is bb. But without additional information, both configurations (Bb \u00d7 bb and bb \u00d7 Bb) would lead to the same outcome. However, the options are distinct, so perhaps the intended answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), assuming that the order matters in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either C or F.\n\nWait, but in reality, the order doesn't matter in a dihybrid cross, so both options represent the same outcome. However, in the options provided, they are listed separately, so perhaps the correct answer is C (bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but let me re-examine. The problem states that both parents are black. Their possible genotypes are Bb or BB. If both are Bb, the cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. If one is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. So the cross where one parent is Bb and the other is bb is the scenario that produces the desired 3:1 ratio. So the parents must be one Bb and one bb.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. These are the same cross, just reversed. So technically, both would lead to the same offspring ratio. However, perhaps in the options, they're presented differently, so the answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because initially I thought option C is correct, but then upon reviewing, realized that option F is also correct. However, since both are the same cross, perhaps the answer is either C or F, but the user expects one letter. So the answer should be either C or F, but since they are the same, perhaps the intended answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm mixing things up. The question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Since one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would be either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Both are valid, but in the options, C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and F is Bb \u00d7 bb. So both are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are Bb, but that would lead to a 1:2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. So no, the parents must consist of one Bb and one bb. Therefore, the correct answer is either C or F, but perhaps the question considers the order, making C the answer.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as A to J, with C being bb \u00d7 Bb and F being Bb \u00d7 bb. So both are correct, but perhaps in the context of the question, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to summarize:\n\nProblem: Parents are both black (B_), cross produces 3/4 black and 1/4 white. Genotype of parents must be such that their cross yields 3:1.\n\nPossible parent combinations:\n- Both Bb: 1:2:1 \u2192 Not matching.\n- Bb & bb: 3:1 \u2192 Correct.\n- BB & B_: 100% BB \u2192 Not matching.\n\nThus, the parents must be one Bb and one bb. Hence, the cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, both C and F correspond to this. However, perhaps the intended answer is C, as it lists the cross as bb \u00d7 Bb, but the actual parents could be Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the order doesn't matter in a cross, so both are equivalent. So perhaps the answer is either C or F, but since the options are separate, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me confirm once more.\n\nWhen you cross Bb (heterozygote) with bb (homozygous recessive), the possible offspring genotypes are Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black, and bb is white. The probability is 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb, hence 3:1 ratio. So the correct answer is that the parents are one Bb and one bb. Therefore, the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to options C and F. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is option C.\n\nHowever, in the options, both C and F are present, but perhaps the question expects only one letter. So the answer is either C or F, but given the way the options are presented, the correct choice is C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting myself tied up in knots here. To resolve this, I'll consider that in the absence of further information, the most accurate conclusion is that the parents are Bb and bb. Thus, the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F, but since both orders are acceptable, perhaps the answer is C.\n\nWait, but no, the options are presented as separate choices, so the correct answer is either C or F. However, given that the options are presented as A to J, with C and F being the relevant ones, and since the parents are one Bb and one bb, the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, which is represented by options C and F respectively. However, since the options are independent, perhaps the answer is C, as it directly represents the cross of bb \u00d7 Bb, which is a valid configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, representing Bb \u00d7 bb. But both are equally correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"most likely\", implying that among the options, which is the best fit. Since the parents could be either Bb and bb, both options C and F are correct. However, since the options are presented independently, perhaps the intended answer is C. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.\n\nWait, no, I think I've made a mistake. The correct cross should be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F, because when you cross Bb with bb, you get 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb. So the correct answer is F, not C.\n\nWait, no, that contradicts my previous reasoning. Let me think clearly. If the parents are Bb and bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which produces 3/4 Bb (black) and 1/4 bb (white). So the correct answer is F. Therefore, despite the confusion earlier, the correct answer is F.\n\nWait, but I'm getting mixed signals here. Earlier, I concluded that both C and F would work, but now I'm thinking that F is correct. Let me verify this.\n\nYes, in fact, the correct cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, producing a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, looking back, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, etc., while F is Bb \u00d7 bb, D is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, which might be two separate pairs being crossed. Hmm, maybe some of these are like double crosses where the first parent produces two types of gametes, then another parent produces two different types, leading to four possible combinations. But I think the problem is more straightforward. Each parent is giving an allele pair, and their combination results in specific offspring ratios.\n\nLet's recall that when you cross two heterozygotes (like Bb \u00d7 Bb), each parent can produce two types of gametes: B and b, each at 50%. When you combine these, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. That gives a 1:2:1 ratio, not matching our 3:1 ratio here. Therefore, option A seems unlikely because it would produce a 1:2:1 ratio, but we have 3:1.\n\nNext, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So the parent with genotype bb can only give b alleles, since they're homozygous recessive. The other parent, Bb, can give either B or b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (if B combines with b) and bb (if b combines with b). Wait, but bb is homozygous recessive, so the phenotype would be white. However, when you cross Bb (which would show black) with bb (which shows white), the expected ratio is 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches our observed data perfectly\u2014three-quarters black and one-quarter white. So option C seems correct.\n\nBut wait, let me check the other options just to make sure. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring will be bb, meaning all white. That doesn't match any of our ratios. Similarly, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as D; all offspring would be Bb? No, wait, if one parent is bb and the other is BB, then all offspring would get B from BB and b from bb, resulting in Bb, which is black. Again, a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. The parent with Bb can give B or b, and the parent with bb can only give b. So the offspring genotypes would be Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black and bb is white. So the ratio should be 75% black and 25% white, which matches our observation. So why am I considering option F now?\n\nWait, no, because in reality, when you cross a Bb and a bb individual, you get a 3:1 ratio. But in this case, does the cross involve two separate parents? If the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then yes, the ratio is 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). So both option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) seem to produce the same ratio. But wait, in the original question, the parents are both guinea pigs, but perhaps one is Bb and the other is bb. Or maybe they're both Bb. Wait, the parents are both Bb and bb? No, wait, the parents can be either same or different genotypes.\n\nWait, going back to the problem statement: \"the scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both of which have black coats.\" So both parents are black, which means their genotypes must be either BB or Bb. Now, the problem asks about the most likely genotypes of the parents. So let's consider all possibilities.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then their cross would yield a 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Which is a 1:2:1 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't match the observed 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). That's exactly the ratio we have. Alternatively, if both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, which would be all black, not matching. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring genotypes would be BB (from BB + B) and Bb (from BB + b and Bb + b). Wait, let me calculate that properly. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the possible gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring would be:\n\nBB (from B and B)\nBB (from B and b)\nBb (from B and b)\nBb (from B and b)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. When you cross BB (genotype B_B_) with Bb (genotype B_b), the possible gametes are B from both parents. So all offspring would be B from BB and B or b from Bb. Wait, no, sorry, let me correct that. The offspring would receive one allele from each parent. So the gamete from BB is B, and the gamete from Bb is B or b. So the possible combinations are:\n\nFrom BB and B: B + B = BB (black)\nFrom BB and b: B + b = Bb (black)\nFrom Bb and B: B + B = BB (black)\nFrom Bb and b: B + b = Bb (black)\n\nWait, that's all black. So that can't explain the 75% black and 25% white. So option D (bb \u00d7 BB) would result in all offspring being Bb (black), which doesn't fit.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would indeed produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white), which fits. So option F would also fit. Wait, but earlier I thought option C was correct. Let me clarify.\n\nIn my initial analysis, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would also produce 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). So both options C and F would lead to the desired ratio. But wait, the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Are both options possible, or is there something else to consider?\n\nLooking back at the problem, the parents are both black, so their possible genotypes are either BB or Bb. Now, the possible combinations for the parents are:\n\n1. Both parents are Bb.\n2. One parent is Bb and the other is bb.\n3. Both parents are BB.\n\nNow, the possible offspring ratios for each combination:\n\n1. Both parents Bb: 1:2:1 \u2192 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Doesn't match 3:1.\n2. One parent Bb, one parent bb: 3:1 \u2192 75% Bb, 25% bb. Matches.\n3. Both parents BB: 100% BB \u2192 All black. Doesn't match.\n\nTherefore, the most likely parents are one being Bb and the other being bb. So the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which leads to a 3:1 ratio. Thus, the correct answer would be either option F or option C, depending on whether the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, but earlier I thought option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) is the same as option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) because multiplication is commutative. So both options are essentially the same in terms of outcome.\n\nWait, but the way the options are presented, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. They are the same cross, so both would produce the same ratio. However, in the context of the problem, the parents are two guinea pigs, both black. So they could either both be Bb or one could be Bb and the other bb.\n\nGiven that, both scenarios are possible, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Since the parents are both black, the most general case is that one is Bb and the other is bb. But without additional information, both configurations (Bb \u00d7 bb and bb \u00d7 Bb) would lead to the same outcome. However, the options are distinct, so perhaps the intended answer is option C (bb \u00d7 Bb), assuming that the order matters in the options. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is either C or F.\n\nWait, but in reality, the order doesn't matter in a dihybrid cross, so both options represent the same outcome. However, in the options provided, they are listed separately, so perhaps the correct answer is C (bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but let me re-examine. The problem states that both parents are black. Their possible genotypes are Bb or BB. If both are Bb, the cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. If one is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would produce 75% Bb and 25% bb. So the cross where one parent is Bb and the other is bb is the scenario that produces the desired 3:1 ratio. So the parents must be one Bb and one bb.\n\nLooking at the options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. These are the same cross, just reversed. So technically, both would lead to the same offspring ratio. However, perhaps in the options, they're presented differently, so the answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting confused because initially I thought option C is correct, but then upon reviewing, realized that option F is also correct. However, since both are the same cross, perhaps the answer is either C or F, but the user expects one letter. So the answer should be either C or F, but since they are the same, perhaps the intended answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm mixing things up. The question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. Since one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross would be either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Both are valid, but in the options, C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and F is Bb \u00d7 bb. So both are correct. But perhaps the intended answer is C.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that both parents are Bb, but that would lead to a 1:2:1 ratio, which doesn't fit. So no, the parents must consist of one Bb and one bb. Therefore, the correct answer is either C or F, but perhaps the question considers the order, making C the answer.\n\nWait, but the options are presented as A to J, with C being bb \u00d7 Bb and F being Bb \u00d7 bb. So both are correct, but perhaps in the context of the question, the correct answer is option C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting conflicting thoughts here. Let me try to summarize:\n\nProblem: Parents are both black (B_), cross produces 3/4 black and 1/4 white. Genotype of parents must be such that their cross yields 3:1.\n\nPossible parent combinations:\n- Both Bb: 1:2:1 \u2192 Not matching.\n- Bb & bb: 3:1 \u2192 Correct.\n- BB & B_: 100% BB \u2192 Not matching.\n\nThus, the parents must be one Bb and one bb. Hence, the cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, both C and F correspond to this. However, perhaps the intended answer is C, as it lists the cross as bb \u00d7 Bb, but the actual parents could be Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nWait, but in reality, the order doesn't matter in a cross, so both are equivalent. So perhaps the answer is either C or F, but since the options are separate, the correct answer is C.\n\nWait, but I'm not entirely confident. Let me confirm once more.\n\nWhen you cross Bb (heterozygote) with bb (homozygous recessive), the possible offspring genotypes are Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black, and bb is white. The probability is 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb, hence 3:1 ratio. So the correct answer is that the parents are one Bb and one bb. Therefore, the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to options C and F. But since the options are separate, perhaps the answer is option C.\n\nHowever, in the options, both C and F are present, but perhaps the question expects only one letter. So the answer is either C or F, but given the way the options are presented, the correct choice is C.\n\nWait, but I'm getting myself tied up in knots here. To resolve this, I'll consider that in the absence of further information, the most accurate conclusion is that the parents are Bb and bb. Thus, the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F, but since both orders are acceptable, perhaps the answer is C.\n\nWait, but no, the options are presented as separate choices, so the correct answer is either C or F. However, given that the options are presented as A to J, with C and F being the relevant ones, and since the parents are one Bb and one bb, the correct cross is either Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb, which is represented by options C and F respectively. However, since the options are independent, perhaps the answer is C, as it directly represents the cross of bb \u00d7 Bb, which is a valid configuration. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is F, representing Bb \u00d7 bb. But both are equally correct.\n\nWait, but the problem says \"most likely\", implying that among the options, which is the best fit. Since the parents could be either Bb and bb, both options C and F are correct. However, since the options are presented independently, perhaps the intended answer is C. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F.\n\nWait, no, I think I've made a mistake. The correct cross should be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F, because when you cross Bb with bb, you get 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb. So the correct answer is F, not C.\n\nWait, no, that contradicts my previous reasoning. Let me think clearly. If the parents are Bb and bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which produces 3/4 Bb (black) and 1/4 bb (white). So the correct answer is F. Therefore, despite the confusion earlier, the correct answer is F.\n\nWait, but I'm getting mixed signals here. Earlier, I concluded that both C and F would work, but now I'm thinking that F is correct. Let me verify this.\n\nYes, in fact, the correct cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, producing a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be repeats, maybe I should consider each possible genotype pair and see which leads to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. Let me think about each option:\n\nOption D says both parents are bb \u00d7 bb. That means all their offspring would be homozygous recessive, so all would have white coats. But in our case, there are some black and some white, so D can't be right.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: the bb parent will always give b, while the Bb parent can give B or b. So the F1 generation would be Bb (from Bb parent giving B and bb giving b) and bb (from Bb giving b and bb giving b). Wait no, actually, each parent gives one allele. The bb parent gives b, and the Bb parent can give B or b. So the possible gametes are 50% B and 50% b. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Wait, but wait, the parents here are bb and Bb. When they cross, the possible offspring genotypes would be Bb (from Bb parent's B and bb parent's b) and bb (from Bb parent's b and bb parent's b). So the ratio would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That matches the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white. So Option C seems correct.\n\nLet me check another option to make sure. For example, Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. The Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent can only give B. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (which would show as Bb, meaning black) and 50% BB (black). Wait, no. If Bb \u00d7 BB, then the offspring would get either B from BB or b from Bb. So 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). All the offspring would be black because even though Bb is present, since both parents contribute B, all children would have at least B. Therefore, the F1 would all be black, leading to a 100% black ratio, which doesn't match the given data. So G is incorrect.\n\nAnother option, Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Similar to Option C, the Bb parent gives B or b, and the BB parent gives B. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). Again, all black. So H is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Same as above, the F1 would be all Bb and BB, hence all black. Incorrect.\n\nOption A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed earlier, the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), matching the observed ratio. However, the options provided include multiple parents being crossed, not just Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back, the question asks which parents were most likely. If both parents are Bb, then yes, that would produce 3:1. But is that an option? Let me check the options. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which fits this scenario. So why is Option C also a possibility?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, whereas Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Both can produce 3:1 ratios, but the question is about the most likely genotype pair. Hmm, but the way the options are presented, each choice combines different parents. So if Option A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\", that's one possibility, and Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\". Are both correct? Or does the question require selecting the most likely, considering any possible pairing?\n\nBut wait, the question states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, each with black coats. The parents' genotypes are among the options listed, which involve pairs like Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 BB, etc. So if the parents are both Bb, that would fit the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, that would also lead to the same outcome. So in that sense, both A and C could be correct. But looking back at the options, each choice represents a single pair of parents. So the question is asking which pair was most likely, implying that only one of the options is correct. Wait, but perhaps I need to re-examine the answer choices more carefully.\n\nLooking back at the options: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo each option is a single pair of parents. So for instance, Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, both A and C can result in a 3:1 ratio. So why is that? Maybe I need to reconsider whether these are the only possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the parents must be of certain types. But the question doesn't specify anything else. So both A and C could be correct. But the options don't allow choosing both, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A to J, each being a single pair. So perhaps the intended answer is A, because it's a single pair, whereas C is a pair involving another genotype. But wait, no\u2014the question is about which pair was most likely, not necessarily the only one. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that the 3:1 ratio comes from a heterozygote (like Bb) crossed with itself, resulting in 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Alternatively, a parent who is homozygous recessive (bb) and another who is heterozygous (Bb) also results in a 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So both A and C can produce a 3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, perhaps only one of them is an option. Let me check again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo both A and C are valid. But perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the question. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe question is: The scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white. The offspring have \u00be black and \u00bc white. Which is the most likely genotype pair for the parents?\n\nIn this context, the possible answers are A-J. So both A and C seem to fit. But perhaps in reality, only one of them is correct based on standard practice. Normally, when a cross results in a 3:1 ratio, it's often due to crossing a heterozygote with itself (e.g., Bb \u00d7 Bb) or a homozygous recessive with a heterozygote (e.g., bb \u00d7 Bb). So both scenarios are possible. However, sometimes, the question might prefer the first scenario, where both parents are heterozygotes, especially if the parents are of a different type. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb,\" which is indeed a possible scenario. So both A and C could be correct, but perhaps in the context of the question, only one of them is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that the parents are both heterozygous, making Option A the correct answer. Or perhaps I'm supposed to choose the pair that includes a homozygous recessive and a heterozygote, which is Option C. But without additional information, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that in the case of Option C, the F1 generation would consist of 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). This matches the observed ratio perfectly. Similarly, in Option A, the same happens. So both A and C are possible. But looking back at the options provided, I notice that both A and C are separate options, so perhaps I need to pick the one that's explicitly stated. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I might have missed something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is phrased such that the parents are both Bb, which is Option A. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), which is exactly what's observed. So Option A is correct. Alternatively, if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, then the F1 would also be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So both A and C would produce the same ratio. But perhaps the question wants us to recognize that either scenario is possible, but in the absence of further details, both are correct. However, since the options are singular, perhaps the intended answer is A, assuming that both parents are Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be repeats, maybe I should consider each possible genotype pair and see which leads to a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. Let me think about each option:\n\nOption D says both parents are bb \u00d7 bb. That means all their offspring would be homozygous recessive, so all would have white coats. But in our case, there are some black and some white, so D can't be right.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: the bb parent will always give b, while the Bb parent can give B or b. So the F1 generation would be Bb (from Bb parent giving B and bb giving b) and bb (from Bb giving b and bb giving b). Wait no, actually, each parent gives one allele. The bb parent gives b, and the Bb parent can give B or b. So the possible gametes are 50% B and 50% b. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Wait, but wait, the parents here are bb and Bb. When they cross, the possible offspring genotypes would be Bb (from Bb parent's B and bb parent's b) and bb (from Bb parent's b and bb parent's b). So the ratio would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That matches the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white. So Option C seems correct.\n\nLet me check another option to make sure. For example, Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. The Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent can only give B. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (which would show as Bb, meaning black) and 50% BB (black). Wait, no. If Bb \u00d7 BB, then the offspring would get either B from BB or b from Bb. So 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). All the offspring would be black because even though Bb is present, since both parents contribute B, all children would have at least B. Therefore, the F1 would all be black, leading to a 100% black ratio, which doesn't match the given data. So G is incorrect.\n\nAnother option, Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Similar to Option C, the Bb parent gives B or b, and the BB parent gives B. So the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). Again, all black. So H is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Same as above, the F1 would be all Bb and BB, hence all black. Incorrect.\n\nOption A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed earlier, the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), matching the observed ratio. However, the options provided include multiple parents being crossed, not just Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back, the question asks which parents were most likely. If both parents are Bb, then yes, that would produce 3:1. But is that an option? Let me check the options. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which fits this scenario. So why is Option C also a possibility?\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake. Because Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, whereas Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Both can produce 3:1 ratios, but the question is about the most likely genotype pair. Hmm, but the way the options are presented, each choice combines different parents. So if Option A is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\", that's one possibility, and Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\". Are both correct? Or does the question require selecting the most likely, considering any possible pairing?\n\nBut wait, the question states that the scientist crossed two guinea pigs, each with black coats. The parents' genotypes are among the options listed, which involve pairs like Bb \u00d7 Bb, Bb \u00d7 BB, etc. So if the parents are both Bb, that would fit the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, that would also lead to the same outcome. So in that sense, both A and C could be correct. But looking back at the options, each choice represents a single pair of parents. So the question is asking which pair was most likely, implying that only one of the options is correct. Wait, but perhaps I need to re-examine the answer choices more carefully.\n\nLooking back at the options: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo each option is a single pair of parents. So for instance, Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, both A and C can result in a 3:1 ratio. So why is that? Maybe I need to reconsider whether these are the only possibilities.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the parents must be of certain types. But the question doesn't specify anything else. So both A and C could be correct. But the options don't allow choosing both, so perhaps I'm misunderstanding something. Wait, looking back, the options are labeled A to J, each being a single pair. So perhaps the intended answer is A, because it's a single pair, whereas C is a pair involving another genotype. But wait, no\u2014the question is about which pair was most likely, not necessarily the only one. Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The main point is that the 3:1 ratio comes from a heterozygote (like Bb) crossed with itself, resulting in 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Alternatively, a parent who is homozygous recessive (bb) and another who is heterozygous (Bb) also results in a 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So both A and C can produce a 3:1 ratio. However, looking at the options, perhaps only one of them is an option. Let me check again:\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo both A and C are valid. But perhaps the question expects only one correct answer. Alternatively, maybe I've misread the question. Let me re-read it.\n\nThe question is: The scientist carried out a cross between two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white. The offspring have \u00be black and \u00bc white. Which is the most likely genotype pair for the parents?\n\nIn this context, the possible answers are A-J. So both A and C seem to fit. But perhaps in reality, only one of them is correct based on standard practice. Normally, when a cross results in a 3:1 ratio, it's often due to crossing a heterozygote with itself (e.g., Bb \u00d7 Bb) or a homozygous recessive with a heterozygote (e.g., bb \u00d7 Bb). So both scenarios are possible. However, sometimes, the question might prefer the first scenario, where both parents are heterozygotes, especially if the parents are of a different type. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, but looking at the options again, Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb,\" which is indeed a possible scenario. So both A and C could be correct, but perhaps in the context of the question, only one of them is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the question implies that the parents are both heterozygous, making Option A the correct answer. Or perhaps I'm supposed to choose the pair that includes a homozygous recessive and a heterozygote, which is Option C. But without additional information, it's hard to say.\n\nHowever, upon closer inspection, I realize that in the case of Option C, the F1 generation would consist of 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). This matches the observed ratio perfectly. Similarly, in Option A, the same happens. So both A and C are possible. But looking back at the options provided, I notice that both A and C are separate options, so perhaps I need to pick the one that's explicitly stated. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is A, but I might have missed something.\n\nWait, another thought: perhaps the question is phrased such that the parents are both Bb, which is Option A. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), which is exactly what's observed. So Option A is correct. Alternatively, if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, then the F1 would also be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So both A and C would produce the same ratio. But perhaps the question wants us to recognize that either scenario is possible, but in the absence of further details, both are correct. However, since the options are singular, perhaps the intended answer is A, assuming that both parents are Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I'm overcomplicating, and the correct answer is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let's consider possible scenarios where the offspring get their alleles such that 75% have black and 25% white. That implies that each parent must contribute a certain proportion of the dominant and recessive alleles. If a parent were homozygous recessive (like bb), then all their offspring would inherit bb, resulting in 0% white coat. But here, some have white, so the parents can't be homozygous recessive. Therefore, both parents must carry at least one dominant allele. Looking at the options, any option without a \"bb\" parent would have all offspring as black, which doesn't fit our data. So, parents must have at least one dominant allele each. Now, considering the 3:1 ratio, which typically arises when there are two different alleles being passed on, leading to a dihybrid situation or something else, but since we're dealing with a single gene here, perhaps it's simpler.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then each parent can pass either B or b. The Punnett square would show four possible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. The phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Wait, no\u2014wait, wait. Because if both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b. So, the offspring would be:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut according to the problem, three-quarters are black and one quarter white. That matches exactly. So if both parents are Bb, the cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, resulting in 25% black (BB and Bb) and 75% white (bb). Wait, hold on\u2014that doesn't add up because 25% + 50% = 75%, plus 25% makes 100%. So yes, 25% black (from BB and Bb) and 75% white (from bb). But the problem says \u00be black and \u00bc white. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, actually, if both parents are Bb, then the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that's 75% black and 25% white. But the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white. Oh, that means my initial assumption was wrong. There's a discrepancy here. So maybe the parents aren't both Bb. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is BB. Then the possible gametes would be B from Bb and B from BB. So the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb x BB: all offspring will have B from Bb and B from BB, so they'll all be BB, which is black. So the phenotype would be 100% black. That doesn't match the problem's data, though. So that can't be right.\n\nAnother possibility is that one parent is Bb and the other is bb. Then the offspring would be:\n\n- All B from Bb and b from bb \u2192 Bb (black).\n- All b from bb \u2192 bb (white).\n\nSo the ratio would be 75% black and 25% white. Again, same issue. So this also doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio.\n\nWait, unless there's another possibility. Maybe the parents are not both heterozygous. Let me see the options again. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which gives the 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio, meaning 75% black and 25% white. This fits except for the exact numbers. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that three quarters have black, which is 75%, and one quarter white. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 75% black and 25% white. Wait, that does match exactly. But earlier I thought that might not fit, but now I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says three quarters have black, and one quarter white. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the outcome is indeed 75% black and 25% white, which fits the description perfectly. So why am I questioning this?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating. Let me recalculate. When both parents are Bb, each can produce B or b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nB | B   B | b  \n---|-----|-----|----  \nB | BB  Bb  \n---|-----|-----|----  \nb | Bb  bb  \n\nSo the four possible offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. So:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThus, 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). That matches the problem's description. So the correct parents would be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to make sure. For example, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As above, that leads to all B from Bb and B from BB, so all offspring are BB, which is black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So the offspring would be:\n\nFrom bb (homozygous recessive): all bb.\n\nFrom Bb \u00d7 bb: all Bb.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All bb: white.\n- All Bb: black.\n\nSo the ratio would be 100% black and 0% white. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can produce B or b. So the possible offspring are:\n\n- B from BB and B from Bb \u2192 BB (black)\n- B from BB and b from Bb \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from BB and B from Bb \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from BB and b from Bb \u2192 bb (white)\n\nSo again, 75% black and 25% white. So that's another option, but the parents are BB and Bb.\n\nLooking back at the options, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in 75% black and 25% white. However, the problem asks for the most likely genotype pair. Now, if both parents are Bb, that's a valid option, whereas if one is BB and the other is Bb, that's also an option. Both seem plausible based on the calculations.\n\nWait, but the answer choices include multiple possibilities. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nNow, option B includes two different cross combinations. So, if option B is correct, it would imply that the parents are either BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, or BB \u00d7 Bb and bb \u00d7 bb, etc. But the problem states that both parents were used. So, each cross in option B is a separate scenario. So, if someone uses BB \u00d7 BB, all offspring would be BB (black). If someone uses BB \u00d7 Bb, as before, all offspring would be Bb (black). If someone uses Bb \u00d7 bb, all offspring would be Bb (black) and bb (white). If someone uses Bb \u00d7 Bb, as discussed, 75% black and 25% white.\n\nSo, among the options, only A and H would result in the desired ratio. But the question is asking which is the most likely genotype pair. Both A and H are valid, but perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard case of a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for the same gene. Alternatively, sometimes the parents might differ in more complex ways, but in this case, both being Bb or one being BB and the other Bb don't change the outcome beyond the same ratio.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the parents were crossed, implying two parents. So, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is a valid scenario. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So both are possible answers. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair, so both A and H are correct. However, in the options provided, I need to choose one letter. Wait, the user hasn't specified whether the parents are the same or different, but the options allow for various combinations.\n\nWait, the problem statement is ambiguous in that sense. It says \"the most likely genotype pair.\" So, if the parents are both Bb, that's option A, which produces the required ratio. If the parents are BB and Bb, that's option H, which also produces the same ratio. So both A and H are correct. But looking back at the options, the user probably expects only one answer. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the parents are different, like one is Bb and the other is bb, but that wouldn't give the 75% black ratio. Only parents who are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one heterozygous (Bb) and the other homozygous recessive (bb) would give 75% black and 25% white. So, both A and H are correct, but the options don't have an option combining both cases. The available options are individual pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a straightforward dihybrid cross, whereas option H involves a different combination of parents. But both A and H would lead to the same ratio. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the most likely pair of parents, so either would work. But the options don't combine them. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, both A and H are present, but the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair. So, perhaps both A and H are correct, but since the options don't allow selecting both, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the calculation, if both parents are Bb, the cross results in 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross also results in 75% black and 25% white. So both A and H are valid. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype pair,\" suggesting that only one is correct. Perhaps I overlooked something in the analysis.\n\nLet me re-examine the dihybrid cross. Wait, no\u2014it's a single gene. So the Punnett square remains the same regardless of the number of genes involved. So, both A and H produce the same ratio. Thus, both are correct, but the options don't provide a combined choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it's a common scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both Bb, but one is Bb and the other is BB, but that would result in all offspring being Bb (black), giving 100% black, which doesn't fit. So, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me think differently. Suppose one parent is Bb and the other is BB. The possible gametes are B from Bb and B from BB. So the offspring would all be B (black). That's 100% black, which doesn't fit the problem's 75% black ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb (black), so 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOnly when both parents are Bb do you get 75% black and 25% white. So, option A is correct, and option H is also correct. But since the question allows for only one answer, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making option A correct. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are BB and Bb, making option H correct. But both produce the same ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the parents are different, like one is Bb and the other is bb, but that's not possible because that would result in 100% Bb (black), which doesn't fit. So, the only way to get 75% black is if both parents are Bb or if one is BB and the other is Bb. But in that case, the parents would be different. So, the most general answer is that the parents are both Bb or one is BB and the other is Bb. But since the options don't combine these, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify that the parents are different. So both A and H are correct. But the options don't have a combined choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard case, while H involves a different combination.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall similar problems. Typically, a dihybrid cross where both parents are Bb results in 75% black and 25% white. Another scenario is a parent being BB and the other being Bb, which also results in the same ratio. So both A and H are correct, but since the options don't allow choosing both, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both A and H are present, but the user wants only one letter. So perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me verify once again. If both parents are Bb, the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So, 75% black and 25% white. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it represents the parents both being Bb, leading to the desired ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: A is Bb \u00d7 Bb; B is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb; C is bb \u00d7 Bb; D is bb \u00d7 bb; E is bb \u00d7 BB; F is Bb \u00d7 bb; G is Bb \u00d7 BB; H is BB \u00d7 Bb; I is BB \u00d7 bb; J is BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this systematically. Let's consider possible scenarios where the offspring get their alleles such that 75% have black and 25% white. That implies that each parent must contribute a certain proportion of the dominant and recessive alleles. If a parent were homozygous recessive (like bb), then all their offspring would inherit bb, resulting in 0% white coat. But here, some have white, so the parents can't be homozygous recessive. Therefore, both parents must carry at least one dominant allele. Looking at the options, any option without a \"bb\" parent would have all offspring as black, which doesn't fit our data. So, parents must have at least one dominant allele each. Now, considering the 3:1 ratio, which typically arises when there are two different alleles being passed on, leading to a dihybrid situation or something else, but since we're dealing with a single gene here, perhaps it's simpler.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then each parent can pass either B or b. The Punnett square would show four possible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. The phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Wait, no\u2014wait, wait. Because if both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b. So, the offspring would be:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut according to the problem, three-quarters are black and one quarter white. That matches exactly. So if both parents are Bb, the cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, resulting in 25% black (BB and Bb) and 75% white (bb). Wait, hold on\u2014that doesn't add up because 25% + 50% = 75%, plus 25% makes 100%. So yes, 25% black (from BB and Bb) and 75% white (from bb). But the problem says \u00be black and \u00bc white. Hmm, that seems conflicting. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me recheck.\n\nWait, actually, if both parents are Bb, then the expected phenotypic ratio is indeed 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that's 75% black and 25% white. But the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white. Oh, that means my initial assumption was wrong. There's a discrepancy here. So maybe the parents aren't both Bb. Let me think again.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps one parent is Bb and the other is BB. Then the possible gametes would be B from Bb and B from BB. So the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb x BB: all offspring will have B from Bb and B from BB, so they'll all be BB, which is black. So the phenotype would be 100% black. That doesn't match the problem's data, though. So that can't be right.\n\nAnother possibility is that one parent is Bb and the other is bb. Then the offspring would be:\n\n- All B from Bb and b from bb \u2192 Bb (black).\n- All b from bb \u2192 bb (white).\n\nSo the ratio would be 75% black and 25% white. Again, same issue. So this also doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio.\n\nWait, unless there's another possibility. Maybe the parents are not both heterozygous. Let me see the options again. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which gives the 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb ratio, meaning 75% black and 25% white. This fits except for the exact numbers. Wait, no\u2014the problem states that three quarters have black, which is 75%, and one quarter white. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 75% black and 25% white. Wait, that does match exactly. But earlier I thought that might not fit, but now I'm getting confused. Let me double-check.\n\nNo, wait, the problem says three quarters have black, and one quarter white. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the outcome is indeed 75% black and 25% white, which fits the description perfectly. So why am I questioning this?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating. Let me recalculate. When both parents are Bb, each can produce B or b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nB | B   B | b  \n---|-----|-----|----  \nB | BB  Bb  \n---|-----|-----|----  \nb | Bb  bb  \n\nSo the four possible offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. So:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThus, 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). That matches the problem's description. So the correct parents would be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option A.\n\nWait, but let me check the other options just to make sure. For example, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As above, that leads to all B from Bb and B from BB, so all offspring are BB, which is black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. So the offspring would be:\n\nFrom bb (homozygous recessive): all bb.\n\nFrom Bb \u00d7 bb: all Bb.\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n\n- All bb: white.\n- All Bb: black.\n\nSo the ratio would be 100% black and 0% white. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can produce B or b. So the possible offspring are:\n\n- B from BB and B from Bb \u2192 BB (black)\n- B from BB and b from Bb \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from BB and B from Bb \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b from BB and b from Bb \u2192 bb (white)\n\nSo again, 75% black and 25% white. So that's another option, but the parents are BB and Bb.\n\nLooking back at the options, both A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would result in 75% black and 25% white. However, the problem asks for the most likely genotype pair. Now, if both parents are Bb, that's a valid option, whereas if one is BB and the other is Bb, that's also an option. Both seem plausible based on the calculations.\n\nWait, but the answer choices include multiple possibilities. Let me review the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nNow, option B includes two different cross combinations. So, if option B is correct, it would imply that the parents are either BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, or BB \u00d7 Bb and bb \u00d7 bb, etc. But the problem states that both parents were used. So, each cross in option B is a separate scenario. So, if someone uses BB \u00d7 BB, all offspring would be BB (black). If someone uses BB \u00d7 Bb, as before, all offspring would be Bb (black). If someone uses Bb \u00d7 bb, all offspring would be Bb (black) and bb (white). If someone uses Bb \u00d7 Bb, as discussed, 75% black and 25% white.\n\nSo, among the options, only A and H would result in the desired ratio. But the question is asking which is the most likely genotype pair. Both A and H are valid, but perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard case of a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for the same gene. Alternatively, sometimes the parents might differ in more complex ways, but in this case, both being Bb or one being BB and the other Bb don't change the outcome beyond the same ratio.\n\nWait, but the problem specifies that the parents were crossed, implying two parents. So, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is a valid scenario. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So both are possible answers. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair, so both A and H are correct. However, in the options provided, I need to choose one letter. Wait, the user hasn't specified whether the parents are the same or different, but the options allow for various combinations.\n\nWait, the problem statement is ambiguous in that sense. It says \"the most likely genotype pair.\" So, if the parents are both Bb, that's option A, which produces the required ratio. If the parents are BB and Bb, that's option H, which also produces the same ratio. So both A and H are correct. But looking back at the options, the user probably expects only one answer. So perhaps I missed something.\n\nWait, another angle: Perhaps the parents are different, like one is Bb and the other is bb, but that wouldn't give the 75% black ratio. Only parents who are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one heterozygous (Bb) and the other homozygous recessive (bb) would give 75% black and 25% white. So, both A and H are correct, but the options don't have an option combining both cases. The available options are individual pairs.\n\nWait, perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a straightforward dihybrid cross, whereas option H involves a different combination of parents. But both A and H would lead to the same ratio. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking for the most likely pair of parents, so either would work. But the options don't combine them. Let me check the options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, both A and H are present, but the question is asking for the most likely genotype pair. So, perhaps both A and H are correct, but since the options don't allow selecting both, perhaps I made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, going back to the calculation, if both parents are Bb, the cross results in 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross also results in 75% black and 25% white. So both A and H are valid. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype pair,\" suggesting that only one is correct. Perhaps I overlooked something in the analysis.\n\nLet me re-examine the dihybrid cross. Wait, no\u2014it's a single gene. So the Punnett square remains the same regardless of the number of genes involved. So, both A and H produce the same ratio. Thus, both are correct, but the options don't provide a combined choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it's a common scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the parents are not both Bb, but one is Bb and the other is BB, but that would result in all offspring being Bb (black), giving 100% black, which doesn't fit. So, no.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the parents' genotypes. Let me think differently. Suppose one parent is Bb and the other is BB. The possible gametes are B from Bb and B from BB. So the offspring would all be B (black). That's 100% black, which doesn't fit the problem's 75% black ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb (black), so 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOnly when both parents are Bb do you get 75% black and 25% white. So, option A is correct, and option H is also correct. But since the question allows for only one answer, perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making option A correct. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are BB and Bb, making option H correct. But both produce the same ratio.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that the parents are different, like one is Bb and the other is bb, but that's not possible because that would result in 100% Bb (black), which doesn't fit. So, the only way to get 75% black is if both parents are Bb or if one is BB and the other is Bb. But in that case, the parents would be different. So, the most general answer is that the parents are both Bb or one is BB and the other is Bb. But since the options don't combine these, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but the problem didn't specify that the parents are different. So both A and H are correct. But the options don't have a combined choice. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a standard case, while H involves a different combination.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit stuck here. Let me try to recall similar problems. Typically, a dihybrid cross where both parents are Bb results in 75% black and 25% white. Another scenario is a parent being BB and the other being Bb, which also results in the same ratio. So both A and H are correct, but since the options don't allow choosing both, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but looking back at the options, both A and H are present, but the user wants only one letter. So perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but perhaps I made a mistake in the initial reasoning. Let me verify once again. If both parents are Bb, the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So, 75% black and 25% white. Yes, that's correct.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A, as it represents the parents both being Bb, leading to the desired ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Wait, no, because the parents involved here are actually both being crossed as separate pairs. So it might not make sense unless both parents were involved in the same cross.

Because each parent can give either B or b. So, four possible combinations: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Wait, but that doesn't make sense because in a dihybrid cross, you get different ratios, but here it's a monohybrid cross. Let me think again.\n\nThe problem states that the parents are both guinea pigs with black coats, so their genotype possibilities are important. Each parent can be either homozygous dominant (BB) or heterozygous (Bb). Now, when they mate, the possible offspring genotypes depend on the parents. For example:\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then each can produce B or b alleles. So, the possible combinations are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). This gives a 3:1 ratio (75% black, 25% white). That fits the description given in the problem. So, the parents must both be Bb. Looking back at the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, but wait, no\u2014option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Actually, since the order doesn't matter in crosses, both BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 BB would result in the same offspring genotypes. However, looking at the answer choices, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. Alternatively, I need to see if any other option leads to the same outcome. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would always produce all white coats, which doesn't fit the data. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would also lead to all white coats for the offspring. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as above. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce 3:1 ratio as well, with 3/4 B_ and 1/4 bb. So, both H and F would produce the desired ratio. But let me check the actual genotypes. If the parents are Bb and Bb, the offspring would all be B_, giving a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option H. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the offspring would be \u00be B_ and \u00bc bb, which also results in a 3:1 ratio. So, both H and F are possible answers based on the initial analysis.

So, whether it's Bb \u00d7 BB or BB \u00d7 Bb, the offspring genotypes would still be BB, Bb, and bb in equal proportions if both parents are Bb. No, wait, that's incorrect. When both parents are Bb, the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So the offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%), leading to a 3:1 ratio. Thus, the correct answer is H or G.

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white).

Alternatively, maybe it's not a dihybrid cross but a monohybrid cross because there's only one gene involved. If the parents are Bb and Bb, then their offspring would all be B_, right?

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb, and G is Bb \u00d7 BB, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, I is BB \u00d7 bb, and J is BB \u00d7 BB. So I need to evaluate each pair to see which can produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a dominant-recessive relationship where the phenotype is based on the presence of the dominant allele, the possible genotype combinations are:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (AA): shows dominant phenotype.\n- Heterozygous (Aa): shows dominant phenotype.\n- Homozygous recessive (aa): shows recessive phenotype.\n\nGiven that the offspring have 3/4 black and 1/4 white, this suggests that the phenotypic ratio corresponds to the probability of inheriting at least one dominant allele. For a simple case like a single gene with two alleles, say B (dominant, black) and b (recessive, white), the possible gametes are B and b, each with equal probability.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygotes (Bb), then each parent can contribute either B or b. The Punnett square would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, in our case, the expected ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, not 25% black and 75% white. That suggests that the parents must be homozygous for the dominant allele because if they're heterozygous, the ratio would be 2:1 instead of 3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. If both parents are homozygous dominant (BB), then all offspring will be BB, resulting in 100% black, which doesn't match our scenario. Alternatively, if both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the ratio is 75% BB and 25% bb, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Hmm, that's closer but still not matching 3:1 exactly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question states that three quarters have black coats and one quarter white. So, the expected ratio is 3:1, meaning that 75% of the offspring have at least one dominant allele (black) and 25% have none (white). This happens when the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb). Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, each parent gives either B or b. The possible combinations are:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nThe ratio of black to white is therefore 3:1, which matches the scenario given. However, looking back at the options, let's check each pair to see their possible offspring ratios.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that produces. Each parent can give either b or B. The possible gametes are b and B, each with 50% probability.\n\nCrossing bb (which is always bb) with Bb (which can give B or b):\n\nPossible combinations:\n- bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 all offspring will be bb (since Bb \u00d7 bb = all bb).\nSo, all offspring are bb, hence all white. That's a 100% white, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option C is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see. bb \u00d7 BB:\n\n- bb (always) can only give b.\n- BB can give B or b.\n\nEach offspring gets either b or B.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- bb \u00d7 B \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 b \u2192 bb\n\nAll offspring are bb, so all white. Again, 100% white, which doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. So Option E is wrong.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as above; all offspring would be Bb \u00d7 B \u2192 B_, which would be B_ (either B or b). Wait, no\u2014wait, BB can only give B, and Bb can give B or b. So the offspring would be B (from BB) and whatever Bb gives. So the possible phenotypes are BB (if Bb gives B) and Bb (if Bb gives b). So the ratio would be 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black, since B is dominant). Wait, but the question says \u00be black, which aligns with that. So why isn't Option G correct?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another possibility. Wait, in the scenario, the parents are crossing to produce offspring with \u00be black and \u00bc white. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's analyze this more carefully.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and BB (homozygous dominant).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n- BB can only produce B (100%).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100% chance)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50% chance)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black (since B is dominant)\n\nSo the ratio is 100% black, which contradicts the scenario. Therefore, Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive. All offspring would be bb, so all white. Again, 100% white, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All offspring would be BB, hence all black. So 100% black, which also doesn't fit.\n\nNow, going back to Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n- bb can only produce b (100%).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from Bb) + b (from bb) = Bb (50%)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from bb) = bb (50%)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Bb: black (since B is dominant)\n- bb: white\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio required. Hence, Option F is incorrect.\n\nLet me now consider Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nParental genotypes: BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- BB can only produce B.\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (50%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n\nThus, 100% black, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option H is incorrect.\n\nFinally, Option I is BB \u00d7 bb.\n\nParental genotypes: BB (homozygous dominant) and bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nGametes produced:\n\n- BB can only produce B.\n- bb can only produce b.\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + b (from bb) = Bb.\n\nPhenotype: black.\n\nAgain, all offspring are black, so 100% black, which doesn't match the scenario. Thus, Option I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option C was bb \u00d7 Bb, which resulted in all white, but let me double-check that.\n\nParental genotypes: bb (homozygous recessive) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nGametes:\n\n- bb can only produce b.\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- b (from bb) + B (from Bb) = Bb.\n- b (from bb) + b (from Bb) = bb.\n\nSo, offspring are either Bb (50%) or bb (50%). Phenotypes: Bb is black, bb is white. So the ratio is 50% black, 50% white. Which is 1:1, not 3:1. So Option C is incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which gave 75% black. Let me re-examine that.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and BB (homozygous dominant).\n\nGametes:\n\n- Bb: 50% B, 50% b.\n- BB: 100% B.\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes: BB is black, Bb is black. So the ratio is 100% black, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option G is incorrect.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I initially thought Option G might be correct, but upon deeper analysis, it's not. Similarly, other options don't fit except possibly Option D, but Option D leads to 100% black. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me go back to the beginning. The question states that \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. This implies that each offspring has a 75% chance of being at least one dominant allele. How does that happen?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypes depend on the number of dominant alleles present. If the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the Punnett square shows:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince B is dominant, BB and Bb are black, while bb is white. So the phenotypic ratio is 75% black : 25% white, which fits the given scenario. Therefore, the parents should be Bb \u00d7 Bb. But let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct answer should be Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut wait, earlier I considered Option G as Bb \u00d7 BB and found that it results in 75% black and 25% white, which also fits the scenario. So why am I getting conflicting conclusions?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. When the parents are Bb \u00d7 BB, the possible offspring are:\n\n- From BB (homozygous dominant): will produce B gametes (100%).\n- From Bb (heterozygous): will produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo the possible combinations:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nSince B is dominant, BB and Bb are black, and bb is white. So the ratio is 75% black, 25% white, which matches the scenario. Therefore, Option G is also a valid possibility.\n\nSimilarly, Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) also results in 75% black, 25% white.\n\nWait, so both Options A and G seem to fit. But the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. Are both pairs possible, or did I make an error in evaluating them?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the parents are diploid individuals. Let's clarify:\n\n- Parental genotype A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 each parent is Bb.\n- Parental genotype G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 one parent is Bb, the other is BB.\n\nBoth cases would lead to the same phenotypic ratio of 75% black, 25% white. Therefore, both A and G produce the desired outcome. But looking back at the options, both are presented. However, the user has listed multiple options, including others. Let me check if any of these pairs would produce a different ratio.\n\nFor example, if the parents were both homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb), all offspring would be bb (100% white), which doesn't fit. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 75% black, 25% white. If both are Bb, same ratio.\n\nSo both A and G produce the same ratio, 75% black, 25% white. Now, considering the options, both A and G are possible. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype, implying a singular correct answer. Perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the options.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option G: Bb \u00d7 BB.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb and BB.\n\nEach can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb: B (50%), b (50%)\n- BB: B (100%)\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nSo, 100% BB and 50% Bb. Since B is dominant, all are black, so 100% black. Therefore, this doesn't fit the 75% black, 25% white ratio.\n\nWait, so that means that only Option G would produce a different ratio than the one we want. Therefore, my initial conclusion was wrong. Only Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and another option might produce the correct ratio. Wait, but I thought both A and G produce the same ratio. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the scenarios. Let me try to calculate the actual probabilities using the Punnett squares for each option.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- BB and Bb: black (75%)\n- bb: white (25%)\n\nSo ratio 3:1, correct.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nThis would imply that the parents are in two separate cross pairs. The total offspring would be all possible combinations of the first pair and the second pair. Calculating the overall ratio would involve combining the results of both pairs.\n\nFirst pair (BB \u00d7 BB):\n\n- All offspring are BB \u2192 100% black.\n\nSecond pair (Bb \u00d7 bb):\n\n- As before, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nSo the combined ratio would be:\n\n- From BB \u00d7 BB: all BB (100%)\n- From BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb: 50% black, 50% white.\n\nThus, overall ratio:\n\n- Black: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150% ?\nWait, no, that's incorrect. It's better to compute the combined effect.\n\nWhen you combine two independent events, the total ratio is the product of their individual ratios.\n\nFirst pair (BB \u00d7 BB): 100% black.\n\nSecond pair (Bb \u00d7 bb): 50% black, 50% white.\n\nTotal offspring:\n\n- From BB \u00d7 BB: all BB \u2192 100% black.\n- From BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb: 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nThus, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(100% black from BB \u00d7 BB) * 1 (since BB \u00d7 BB is 100%) plus (50% Bb from BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%. Wait, no, that approach isn't accurate. Instead, since all outcomes are independent, the total ratio is calculated by multiplying the fractions of each event.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of offspring is the sum of all possible combinations. Since the first pair is guaranteed to produce BB (100%), and the second pair produces a mix of Bb and bb, the overall ratio becomes:\n\nBlack: (Probability of BB \u00d7 BB) * 100% + (Probability of BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%\nWhite: (Probability of BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%\n\nWhich is:\n\nBlack: 1 * 100% + 0.5 * 100% = 150%?\nNo, that's not possible because probabilities can't exceed 100%. Instead, the correct way is:\n\nThe total black offspring come from two sources:\n\n1. BB (from first pair) \u00d7 BB (from second pair): all BB \u2192 100% of the offspring from this source are black.\n2. BB (from first pair) \u00d7 Bb (from second pair): 50% of the offspring from this source are Bb (black).\n\nThe total white offspring come only from BB \u00d7 bb: 50% of the offspring from this source are bb (white).\n\nThus, the overall ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150%? No, that's impossible. It should be 100% black and 50% white. Wait, that doesn't add up because the total must be 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I have two independent genetic events:\n\n1. First event: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (100% black).\n2. Second event: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nThe total offspring are all possible combinations, which include:\n\n- BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 100% BB (all black).\n- BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 50% Bb (black).\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% bb (white).\n\nThus, the fraction of black offspring is:\n\n(100% BB) + (50% Bb) = 150%, but that's more than 100%, which is impossible. Wait, that indicates an error in reasoning. Actually, the correct approach is to recognize that each event occurs independently, and the total number of offspring is the product of the fractions of each event.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the first event is certain to produce BB, and the second event produces 50% Bb and 50% bb. So the total offspring will consist of:\n\n- BB (100% of the time) \u2192 black.\n- Bb (50% of the time) \u2192 black.\n- bb (50% of the time) \u2192 white.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% + 50% = 150% \u2192 which is impossible because the total must be 100%. Wait, this suggests that the assumption is incorrect. Maybe I shouldn't be treating the first pair as producing BB 100% of the time but rather considering that each cross produces its own distribution. Let me try again.\n\nFirst pair: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 all offspring are BB \u2192 100% black.\n\nSecond pair: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white).\n\nThe total offspring are the combination of these two events. Since the first pair is certain to produce BB, and the second pair produces 50% Bb and 50% bb, the overall offspring ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150% \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait, clearly, this method is flawed. Instead, I'll use the probabilities directly.\n\nThe total possible combinations are:\n\n- BB (first pair) \u00d7 BB (second pair): 100% BB \u2192 100% black.\n- BB \u00d7 Bb: 50% Bb \u2192 black.\n- BB \u00d7 bb: 50% bb \u2192 white.\n\nSo, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(100% from BB\u00d7BB) + (50% from BB\u00d7Bb) = 150%, but that's impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that the entire sample space consists of these three possibilities, each weighted according to their probabilities.\n\nThe probability of each outcome is:\n\n- BB\u00d7BB: 1 (100%) \u00d7 1 (100%) = 1 \u2192 100% of the population.\n- BB\u00d7Bb: 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%.\n- BB\u00d7bb: 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%.\n\nThus, the total proportion of black offspring is 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5 times the BB\u00d7BB group. Wait, but probabilities cannot exceed 1. So perhaps the correct calculation is:\n\nBlack offspring: 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5, but this exceeds 1. Therefore, the correct way is to normalize the probabilities.\n\nThe total probability of black is 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5. But since probabilities can't exceed 1, this suggests that the BB\u00d7BB produces 100% of the population, and the remaining 50% are split equally between BB\u00d7Bb and BB\u00d7bb. Therefore, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(1 \u00d7 1) + (0.5 \u00d7 0.5) / (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the fraction of each genotype in the total population.\n\nThe total population includes:\n\n- 100% BB (from BB\u00d7BB)\n- 50% Bb (from BB\u00d7Bb)\n- 50% bb (from BB\u00d7bb)\n\nThus, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- BB: 100% of the total\n- Bb: 50% of the total\n- bb: 50% of the total\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the fact that the BB\u00d7Bb cross produces Bb at 50% and bb at 50%. So the overall frequencies would be:\n\n- BB: 100% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 100% of the total population.\n- Bb: 50% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 50% of the total population.\n- bb: 50% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 50% of the total population.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the BB\u00d7Bb cross itself produces 50% Bb and 50% bb, so the total in the combined population would be:\n\n- BB: 100% (from BB\u00d7BB)\n- Bb: 50% (from BB\u00d7Bb)\n- bb: 50% (from BB\u00d7bb)\n\nSo the ratio of phenotypes is:\n\nBlack: BB (100%) + Bb (50%) \u2192 150% \u2192 which is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that the proportion of each genotype is:\n\n- BB: (100% \u00d7 100%) = 100% of the total.\n- Bb: (100% \u00d7 50%) = 50% of the total.\n- bb: (100% \u00d7 50%) = 50% of the total.\n\nBut since the total must be 100%, the actual proportions are:\n\nBB: 100% / (100% + 50% + 50%) = 100% / 200% = 0.5 \u2192 50%\nBb: 50% / 200% = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nbb: 50% / 200% = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nBlack: Bb (25%) + BB (50%) = 75% black, 25% white.\n\nWhich matches the scenario described. Therefore, Option B, which involves parents BB \u00d7 Bb, would produce a 75% black, 25% white ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would also produce the same ratio.\n\nSo now, the confusion arises because both Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and Option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) produce the correct 75% black, 25% white ratio. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. Since both are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is Option A because it represents both parents contributing a B allele, making all offspring have at least one dominant allele. While Option G also satisfies the condition, it involves one parent contributing a recessive allele and the other a dominant one, which still allows for the correct ratio. But perhaps the intended answer is Option A.\n\nHowever, looking back, the user's options included other pairs as well, such as Option D (bb \u00d7 bb) and Option J (bb \u00d7 BB). We've already ruled those out because they produce 100% white or 100% black respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be either Option A or Option G, depending on the exact phrasing of the question. But since the question specifies \"the most likely genotype,\" and both A and G yield the correct ratio, I need to determine which one is more probable.\n\nTypically, when both pairs lead to the same outcome, the options that are genetically consistent with that outcome are preferred. Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) is a classic case where both parents contribute a B allele, ensuring at least one B allele in every offspring. Option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) involves one parent providing a dominant B and the other a dominant B, so regardless of the other parent's genotype, the offspring will still have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, both A and G are viable answers, but since the question provides them separately, perhaps the intended answer is Option A. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only the monohybrid cross, which would be Option A.\n\nWait, but the user provided a table showing that some pairs produce the correct ratio. Looking back, the user's original question had several options, and the assistant needs to pick the best answer. In this case, both A and G are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is Option A, as it's the standard monohybrid cross.\n\nHowever, since the user is expecting a single answer, and considering that both A and G lead to the correct ratio, but the question may be referring to a specific scenario, I'll proceed to select Option A as the most likely answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb, and G is Bb \u00d7 BB, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, I is BB \u00d7 bb, and J is BB \u00d7 BB. So I need to evaluate each pair to see which can produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio.\n\nFirst, let me recall that for a dominant-recessive relationship where the phenotype is based on the presence of the dominant allele, the possible genotype combinations are:\n\n- Homozygous dominant (AA): shows dominant phenotype.\n- Heterozygous (Aa): shows dominant phenotype.\n- Homozygous recessive (aa): shows recessive phenotype.\n\nGiven that the offspring have 3/4 black and 1/4 white, this suggests that the phenotypic ratio corresponds to the probability of inheriting at least one dominant allele. For a simple case like a single gene with two alleles, say B (dominant, black) and b (recessive, white), the possible gametes are B and b, each with equal probability.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygotes (Bb), then each parent can contribute either B or b. The Punnett square would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, in our case, the expected ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, not 25% black and 75% white. That suggests that the parents must be homozygous for the dominant allele because if they're heterozygous, the ratio would be 2:1 instead of 3:1. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s not right. If both parents are homozygous dominant (BB), then all offspring will be BB, resulting in 100% black, which doesn't match our scenario. Alternatively, if both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the ratio is 75% BB and 25% bb, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Hmm, that's closer but still not matching 3:1 exactly. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.\n\nWait, the question states that three quarters have black coats and one quarter white. So, the expected ratio is 3:1, meaning that 75% of the offspring have at least one dominant allele (black) and 25% have none (white). This happens when the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb). Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, each parent gives either B or b. The possible combinations are:\n\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n- bb (from b and b)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n- bb: white\n\nThe ratio of black to white is therefore 3:1, which matches the scenario given. However, looking back at the options, let's check each pair to see their possible offspring ratios.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Let's see what that produces. Each parent can give either b or B. The possible gametes are b and B, each with 50% probability.\n\nCrossing bb (which is always bb) with Bb (which can give B or b):\n\nPossible combinations:\n- bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 all offspring will be bb (since Bb \u00d7 bb = all bb).\nSo, all offspring are bb, hence all white. That's a 100% white, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option C is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Let's see. bb \u00d7 BB:\n\n- bb (always) can only give b.\n- BB can give B or b.\n\nEach offspring gets either b or B.\n\nPossible combinations:\n\n- bb \u00d7 B \u2192 bb\n- bb \u00d7 b \u2192 bb\n\nAll offspring are bb, so all white. Again, 100% white, which doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. So Option E is wrong.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as above; all offspring would be Bb \u00d7 B \u2192 B_, which would be B_ (either B or b). Wait, no\u2014wait, BB can only give B, and Bb can give B or b. So the offspring would be B (from BB) and whatever Bb gives. So the possible phenotypes are BB (if Bb gives B) and Bb (if Bb gives b). So the ratio would be 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black, since B is dominant). Wait, but the question says \u00be black, which aligns with that. So why isn't Option G correct?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another possibility. Wait, in the scenario, the parents are crossing to produce offspring with \u00be black and \u00bc white. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let's analyze this more carefully.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and BB (homozygous dominant).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n- BB can only produce B (100%).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100% chance)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50% chance)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black (since B is dominant)\n\nSo the ratio is 100% black, which contradicts the scenario. Therefore, Option G is incorrect.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive. All offspring would be bb, so all white. Again, 100% white, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All offspring would be BB, hence all black. So 100% black, which also doesn't fit.\n\nNow, going back to Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n- bb can only produce b (100%).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from Bb) + b (from bb) = Bb (50%)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from bb) = bb (50%)\n\nThus, the phenotypes would be:\n\n- Bb: black (since B is dominant)\n- bb: white\n\nTherefore, the ratio is 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio required. Hence, Option F is incorrect.\n\nLet me now consider Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nParental genotypes: BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nEach parent can produce gametes:\n\n- BB can only produce B.\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (50%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- BB: black\n- Bb: black\n\nThus, 100% black, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option H is incorrect.\n\nFinally, Option I is BB \u00d7 bb.\n\nParental genotypes: BB (homozygous dominant) and bb (homozygous recessive).\n\nGametes produced:\n\n- BB can only produce B.\n- bb can only produce b.\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n\n- B (from BB) + b (from bb) = Bb.\n\nPhenotype: black.\n\nAgain, all offspring are black, so 100% black, which doesn't match the scenario. Thus, Option I is incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option C was bb \u00d7 Bb, which resulted in all white, but let me double-check that.\n\nParental genotypes: bb (homozygous recessive) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nGametes:\n\n- bb can only produce b.\n- Bb can produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- b (from bb) + B (from Bb) = Bb.\n- b (from bb) + b (from Bb) = bb.\n\nSo, offspring are either Bb (50%) or bb (50%). Phenotypes: Bb is black, bb is white. So the ratio is 50% black, 50% white. Which is 1:1, not 3:1. So Option C is incorrect.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought Option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which gave 75% black. Let me re-examine that.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb (heterozygous) and BB (homozygous dominant).\n\nGametes:\n\n- Bb: 50% B, 50% b.\n- BB: 100% B.\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes: BB is black, Bb is black. So the ratio is 100% black, which doesn't fit the scenario. So Option G is incorrect.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because I initially thought Option G might be correct, but upon deeper analysis, it's not. Similarly, other options don't fit except possibly Option D, but Option D leads to 100% black. So maybe I'm missing something.\n\nWait, let me go back to the beginning. The question states that \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. This implies that each offspring has a 75% chance of being at least one dominant allele. How does that happen?\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, the possible phenotypes depend on the number of dominant alleles present. If the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), the Punnett square shows:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nSince B is dominant, BB and Bb are black, while bb is white. So the phenotypic ratio is 75% black : 25% white, which fits the given scenario. Therefore, the parents should be Bb \u00d7 Bb. But let me check the options again.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nOptions A to H:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nFrom my analysis, the correct answer should be Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut wait, earlier I considered Option G as Bb \u00d7 BB and found that it results in 75% black and 25% white, which also fits the scenario. So why am I getting conflicting conclusions?\n\nAh, I think I made a mistake earlier. When the parents are Bb \u00d7 BB, the possible offspring are:\n\n- From BB (homozygous dominant): will produce B gametes (100%).\n- From Bb (heterozygous): will produce B (50%) and b (50%).\n\nSo the possible combinations:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nSince B is dominant, BB and Bb are black, and bb is white. So the ratio is 75% black, 25% white, which matches the scenario. Therefore, Option G is also a valid possibility.\n\nSimilarly, Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) also results in 75% black, 25% white.\n\nWait, so both Options A and G seem to fit. But the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. Are both pairs possible, or did I make an error in evaluating them?\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider whether the parents are diploid individuals. Let's clarify:\n\n- Parental genotype A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 each parent is Bb.\n- Parental genotype G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 one parent is Bb, the other is BB.\n\nBoth cases would lead to the same phenotypic ratio of 75% black, 25% white. Therefore, both A and G produce the desired outcome. But looking back at the options, both are presented. However, the user has listed multiple options, including others. Let me check if any of these pairs would produce a different ratio.\n\nFor example, if the parents were both homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb), all offspring would be bb (100% white), which doesn't fit. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 75% black, 25% white. If both are Bb, same ratio.\n\nSo both A and G produce the same ratio, 75% black, 25% white. Now, considering the options, both A and G are possible. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype, implying a singular correct answer. Perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating one of the options.\n\nWait, let me double-check Option G: Bb \u00d7 BB.\n\nParental genotypes: Bb and BB.\n\nEach can produce gametes:\n\n- Bb: B (50%), b (50%)\n- BB: B (100%)\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) = BB (100%)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) = Bb (50%)\n\nSo, 100% BB and 50% Bb. Since B is dominant, all are black, so 100% black. Therefore, this doesn't fit the 75% black, 25% white ratio.\n\nWait, so that means that only Option G would produce a different ratio than the one we want. Therefore, my initial conclusion was wrong. Only Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and another option might produce the correct ratio. Wait, but I thought both A and G produce the same ratio. Let me reevaluate.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm confusing the scenarios. Let me try to calculate the actual probabilities using the Punnett squares for each option.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nPossible offspring:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nPhenotypes:\n\n- BB and Bb: black (75%)\n- bb: white (25%)\n\nSo ratio 3:1, correct.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\n\nThis would imply that the parents are in two separate cross pairs. The total offspring would be all possible combinations of the first pair and the second pair. Calculating the overall ratio would involve combining the results of both pairs.\n\nFirst pair (BB \u00d7 BB):\n\n- All offspring are BB \u2192 100% black.\n\nSecond pair (Bb \u00d7 bb):\n\n- As before, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nSo the combined ratio would be:\n\n- From BB \u00d7 BB: all BB (100%)\n- From BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb: 50% black, 50% white.\n\nThus, overall ratio:\n\n- Black: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150% ?\nWait, no, that's incorrect. It's better to compute the combined effect.\n\nWhen you combine two independent events, the total ratio is the product of their individual ratios.\n\nFirst pair (BB \u00d7 BB): 100% black.\n\nSecond pair (Bb \u00d7 bb): 50% black, 50% white.\n\nTotal offspring:\n\n- From BB \u00d7 BB: all BB \u2192 100% black.\n- From BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb: 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nThus, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(100% black from BB \u00d7 BB) * 1 (since BB \u00d7 BB is 100%) plus (50% Bb from BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%. Wait, no, that approach isn't accurate. Instead, since all outcomes are independent, the total ratio is calculated by multiplying the fractions of each event.\n\nAlternatively, the total number of offspring is the sum of all possible combinations. Since the first pair is guaranteed to produce BB (100%), and the second pair produces a mix of Bb and bb, the overall ratio becomes:\n\nBlack: (Probability of BB \u00d7 BB) * 100% + (Probability of BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%\nWhite: (Probability of BB \u00d7 Bb \u00d7 bb) * 100%\n\nWhich is:\n\nBlack: 1 * 100% + 0.5 * 100% = 150%?\nNo, that's not possible because probabilities can't exceed 100%. Instead, the correct way is:\n\nThe total black offspring come from two sources:\n\n1. BB (from first pair) \u00d7 BB (from second pair): all BB \u2192 100% of the offspring from this source are black.\n2. BB (from first pair) \u00d7 Bb (from second pair): 50% of the offspring from this source are Bb (black).\n\nThe total white offspring come only from BB \u00d7 bb: 50% of the offspring from this source are bb (white).\n\nThus, the overall ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150%? No, that's impossible. It should be 100% black and 50% white. Wait, that doesn't add up because the total must be 100%.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm miscalculating. Let me think differently.\n\nIf I have two independent genetic events:\n\n1. First event: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (100% black).\n2. Second event: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white).\n\nThe total offspring are all possible combinations, which include:\n\n- BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 100% BB (all black).\n- BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 50% Bb (black).\n- BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% bb (white).\n\nThus, the fraction of black offspring is:\n\n(100% BB) + (50% Bb) = 150%, but that's more than 100%, which is impossible. Wait, that indicates an error in reasoning. Actually, the correct approach is to recognize that each event occurs independently, and the total number of offspring is the product of the fractions of each event.\n\nBut perhaps a simpler way is to note that the first event is certain to produce BB, and the second event produces 50% Bb and 50% bb. So the total offspring will consist of:\n\n- BB (100% of the time) \u2192 black.\n- Bb (50% of the time) \u2192 black.\n- bb (50% of the time) \u2192 white.\n\nTherefore, the ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% + 50% = 150% \u2192 which is impossible because the total must be 100%. Wait, this suggests that the assumption is incorrect. Maybe I shouldn't be treating the first pair as producing BB 100% of the time but rather considering that each cross produces its own distribution. Let me try again.\n\nFirst pair: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 all offspring are BB \u2192 100% black.\n\nSecond pair: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 50% Bb (black), 50% bb (white).\n\nThe total offspring are the combination of these two events. Since the first pair is certain to produce BB, and the second pair produces 50% Bb and 50% bb, the overall offspring ratio is:\n\nBlack: 100% (from BB \u00d7 BB) + 50% (from BB \u00d7 Bb) = 150% \u2192 impossible.\n\nWait, clearly, this method is flawed. Instead, I'll use the probabilities directly.\n\nThe total possible combinations are:\n\n- BB (first pair) \u00d7 BB (second pair): 100% BB \u2192 100% black.\n- BB \u00d7 Bb: 50% Bb \u2192 black.\n- BB \u00d7 bb: 50% bb \u2192 white.\n\nSo, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(100% from BB\u00d7BB) + (50% from BB\u00d7Bb) = 150%, but that's impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that the entire sample space consists of these three possibilities, each weighted according to their probabilities.\n\nThe probability of each outcome is:\n\n- BB\u00d7BB: 1 (100%) \u00d7 1 (100%) = 1 \u2192 100% of the population.\n- BB\u00d7Bb: 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%.\n- BB\u00d7bb: 1 \u00d7 0.5 = 0.5 \u2192 50%.\n\nThus, the total proportion of black offspring is 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5 times the BB\u00d7BB group. Wait, but probabilities cannot exceed 1. So perhaps the correct calculation is:\n\nBlack offspring: 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5, but this exceeds 1. Therefore, the correct way is to normalize the probabilities.\n\nThe total probability of black is 1 (from BB\u00d7BB) + 0.5 (from BB\u00d7Bb) = 1.5. But since probabilities can't exceed 1, this suggests that the BB\u00d7BB produces 100% of the population, and the remaining 50% are split equally between BB\u00d7Bb and BB\u00d7bb. Therefore, the proportion of black offspring is:\n\n(1 \u00d7 1) + (0.5 \u00d7 0.5) / (1 + 0.5 + 0.5) ?\n\nWait, perhaps it's easier to calculate the fraction of each genotype in the total population.\n\nThe total population includes:\n\n- 100% BB (from BB\u00d7BB)\n- 50% Bb (from BB\u00d7Bb)\n- 50% bb (from BB\u00d7bb)\n\nThus, the frequency of each genotype is:\n\n- BB: 100% of the total\n- Bb: 50% of the total\n- bb: 50% of the total\n\nBut wait, that doesn't account for the fact that the BB\u00d7Bb cross produces Bb at 50% and bb at 50%. So the overall frequencies would be:\n\n- BB: 100% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 100% of the total population.\n- Bb: 50% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 50% of the total population.\n- bb: 50% of the BB\u00d7BB group \u2192 50% of the total population.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because the BB\u00d7Bb cross itself produces 50% Bb and 50% bb, so the total in the combined population would be:\n\n- BB: 100% (from BB\u00d7BB)\n- Bb: 50% (from BB\u00d7Bb)\n- bb: 50% (from BB\u00d7bb)\n\nSo the ratio of phenotypes is:\n\nBlack: BB (100%) + Bb (50%) \u2192 150% \u2192 which is impossible. Therefore, the correct approach is to realize that the proportion of each genotype is:\n\n- BB: (100% \u00d7 100%) = 100% of the total.\n- Bb: (100% \u00d7 50%) = 50% of the total.\n- bb: (100% \u00d7 50%) = 50% of the total.\n\nBut since the total must be 100%, the actual proportions are:\n\nBB: 100% / (100% + 50% + 50%) = 100% / 200% = 0.5 \u2192 50%\nBb: 50% / 200% = 0.25 \u2192 25%\nbb: 50% / 200% = 0.25 \u2192 25%\n\nWait, that makes sense. So the phenotypic ratio is:\n\nBlack: Bb (25%) + BB (50%) = 75% black, 25% white.\n\nWhich matches the scenario described. Therefore, Option B, which involves parents BB \u00d7 Bb, would produce a 75% black, 25% white ratio.\n\nSimilarly, Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would also produce the same ratio.\n\nSo now, the confusion arises because both Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and Option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) produce the correct 75% black, 25% white ratio. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents. Since both are possible, but perhaps the intended answer is Option A because it represents both parents contributing a B allele, making all offspring have at least one dominant allele. While Option G also satisfies the condition, it involves one parent contributing a recessive allele and the other a dominant one, which still allows for the correct ratio. But perhaps the intended answer is Option A.\n\nHowever, looking back, the user's options included other pairs as well, such as Option D (bb \u00d7 bb) and Option J (bb \u00d7 BB). We've already ruled those out because they produce 100% white or 100% black respectively.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer should be either Option A or Option G, depending on the exact phrasing of the question. But since the question specifies \"the most likely genotype,\" and both A and G yield the correct ratio, I need to determine which one is more probable.\n\nTypically, when both pairs lead to the same outcome, the options that are genetically consistent with that outcome are preferred. Option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) is a classic case where both parents contribute a B allele, ensuring at least one B allele in every offspring. Option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) involves one parent providing a dominant B and the other a dominant B, so regardless of the other parent's genotype, the offspring will still have at least one B allele.\n\nTherefore, both A and G are viable answers, but since the question provides them separately, perhaps the intended answer is Option A. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects only the monohybrid cross, which would be Option A.\n\nWait, but the user provided a table showing that some pairs produce the correct ratio. Looking back, the user's original question had several options, and the assistant needs to pick the best answer. In this case, both A and G are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is Option A, as it's the standard monohybrid cross.\n\nHowever, since the user is expecting a single answer, and considering that both A and G lead to the correct ratio, but the question may be referring to a specific scenario, I'll proceed to select Option A as the most likely answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white).

But wait, the parents are both guinea pigs, right? Or perhaps they're diploid animals, meaning each parent has two alleles for each gene. Since there's no mention of multiple genes, I think this is a single-gene locus problem.\n\nLet me consider each option:\n\nOption A: Both parents are heterozygous (Bb). If they mate, their offspring will follow a 3:1 ratio because each parent can produce a B or b gamete. The possible combinations are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Out of these, BB and Bb will express the dominant phenotype (black), while bb will express the recessive (white). So the ratio would indeed be 3:1 (BB and Bb = 75%, bb = 25%), matching the given data. So Option A sounds promising.\n\nOption B: One parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Their offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Again, the same ratio applies, leading to 3:1 black:white. So this also fits the given data. Hmm, interesting.\n\nOption C: One parent is homozygous recessive (bb), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). The offspring would be BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Same as before, 3:1. So Option C also works.\n\nOption D: Both parents are homozygous recessive (bb). All offspring would be bb, so 100% white. Doesn't fit the given data.\n\nOption E: One parent is bb, the other is BB. Same as above; all offspring would be Bb, so 100% black. No match.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). So 50% black, 50% white. That doesn't match the given 75% black, 25% white ratio.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Parents are Bb and BB. Each gamete from BB is B, and from Bb is B and b. So offspring genotypes would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Again, 75% black, 25% white. This also fits.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, each parent can give either B or b. Parent 1 gives B, parent 2 gives B or b. So offspring are BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Still 75% black, 25% white. So this works too.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Similar to above. Offspring would be Bb (50%) and bb (50%). So again, 75% black, 25% white. Fits.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring are BB. So 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo looking back, Options A, B, C, G, H, I all result in a 3:1 ratio. Now, the question is about the genotype of the parents being \"most likely.\" So among these, which ones are more probable based on the observed traits?\n\nWait, but when you have a 3:1 ratio, it can come from several parent combinations. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb produces 3:1, Bb \u00d7 bb produces 3:1, etc. However, maybe some of these are more likely than others. Alternatively, perhaps the parents must be able to produce those specific gametes. Let's see.\n\nLooking at the options, the parents in each case are:\n\nA: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 both heterozygotes\nB: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 one homozygote and one heterozygote\nC: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 one homozygote and one heterozygote\nD: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 both homozygotes\nE: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as D\nF: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 different combination\nG: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as A\nH: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as B\nI: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as E\nJ: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 both homozygotes\n\nNow, considering whether the parents can actually produce the necessary gametes, which affects the likelihood. For instance, if a parent is homozygous recessive (like bb), they can only pass on the recessive allele. Whereas a heterozygous parent can pass either allele.\n\nBut since all the options where a parent is homozygous (Bb, BB, bb) can produce the necessary gametes, any of these combinations would result in the 3:1 ratio. However, without additional information about the parents, such as their ability to produce certain gametes, it's hard to say which is more likely.\n\nWait, but the question says the genotypes were \"most likely\" to be paired. Maybe the question expects us to find which pair would result in the observed ratio, regardless of which option is correct.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that one parent is homozygous for the dominant trait and the other is homozygous recessive. Because sometimes in such problems, the parents might be expected to be one homozygous and one homozygous recessive. Looking back, in our analysis, Bb \u00d7 bb produces the 3:1 ratio, which matches the given data.\n\nSo if the parents are Bb and bb, then the answer would be F. But wait, earlier I thought of G as Bb \u00d7 BB, which also gives 3:1, but according to my initial assessment, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which fits.\n\nHowever, another possibility is that the parents are both heterozygous (A), but let me check the possible cross outcomes for Bb \u00d7 Bb. As I mentioned, the offspring are 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 3/4 black, 1/4 white, which matches the problem statement.\n\nSimilarly, Bb \u00d7 bb would produce 25% Bb and 25% bb. So again, 75% black, 25% white.\n\nTherefore, options A and F both produce the desired ratio. Now, why would the question ask which is more likely? Perhaps because the parents are considered to be of certain types\u2014maybe the parents are supposed to be one homozygous and one heterozygous.\n\nIn many genetic problems, when asked about the genotype of the parents resulting in a particular ratio, often the assumption is that one parent is homozygous dominant and the other is heterozygous. For example, in cases where the trait is not present in the parents, the cross is usually between a heterozygote and a homozygote recessive.\n\nGiven that, the most likely pairing would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which also gives the 3:1 ratio. So why is option F better?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. If the parents are both heterozygotes, their offspring can produce all four combinations, but the 3:1 arises because only the homozygous recessive (bb) shows the recessive phenotype, while the others show the dominant. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are 25% Bb and 25% bb, again 3:1.\n\nTherefore, both options A and F lead to the correct ratio. But in terms of typical textbook questions, the setup often involves a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive. Therefore, the most likely pairing is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

For example, in cases where the trait is not present in the parents, the cross is usually between a heterozygote and a homozygote recessive.\n\nGiven that, the most likely pairing would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which also gives the 3:1 ratio. So why is option F better?\n\nHmm, perhaps I need to reevaluate. If the parents are both heterozygotes, their offspring can produce all four combinations, but the 3:1 arises because only the homozygous recessive (bb) shows the recessive phenotype, while the others show the dominant. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring are 25% Bb and 25% bb, again 3:1.\n\nTherefore, both options A and F lead to the correct ratio. But in terms of typical textbook questions, the setup often involves a heterozygote and a homozygous recessive. Therefore, the most likely pairing is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios.

Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio.

So, each offspring must be a certain genotype leading to their coat color. Let me think about possible scenarios.\n\nFirst, if the parents are both Bb, then the F1 would show a 3:1 ratio because each parent can contribute either B or b. So, when they combine, you get:\n\n- BB (25%) \n- Bb (50%) \n- bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, since coat color is dominant (B), the bb will express the recessive phenotype (white), while BB and Bb will express black. So, in this case, the phenotypic ratio would indeed be 3:1, matching the description here. But let me check another possibility.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the F1 would be:\n\n- From BB: BB (100%)\n- From Bb: Bb and bb (each 50%)\n\nSo, the phenotypes would be:\n- BB: black (100%)\n- Bb: black (50%) \u2192 but wait, no, because B is dominant, so all B alleles present make the animal black. So, all offspring would be black. That doesn't match the given data where only 75% are black.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, then the F1 would all be Bb, which would all be black. Again, not matching.\n\nAnother possibility is one parent being Bb and the other also Bb, which leads to the 3:1 ratio as I thought earlier.\n\nLooking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as option E (bb \u00d7 BB). Wait, no, E is bb \u00d7 BB, and G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Hmm, perhaps I misread earlier. Let me clarify: Each option is a separate pair of parents.\n\nLet me evaluate each pair:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed, this results in 3/4 B (black) and 1/4 b (white).\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This seems more complicated because it's two different crosses. If we consider the overall population, each cross would produce different ratios, and combining them might not give exactly 3:1.\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. The F1 would be bb (25%) and Bb (50%). Phenotype-wise, bb is white, Bb is black. So, 25% white, 75% black. But the question says 75% black, 25% white, so this matches. But does it come from which parents?\nWait, no, because if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, the F1 would be 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). So, yes, that's correct.\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. All offspring would be bb, so 100% white. Doesn't fit.\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option A, both parents are homozygous recessive (bb) and dominant (BB). The F1 would be Bb (75% black), bb (25% white). So, same as option A.\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Parents are Bb and bb. The F1 would be 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). Same as above.\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as A and E; F1 is Bb (75%), bb (25%).\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. As mentioned before, all F1 would be Bb, so 75% black.\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. All F1 would be Bb, so same as H.\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. All F1 would be BB, so 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, now I see that options A, E, G, F, H, I, J don't all lead to the correct ratio except A, E, and G. Because in E, it's bb \u00d7 BB, which gives 75% B (black), 25% b (white). Similarly, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which also gives the same. Whereas F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which also works. So, all these pairs (A, E, G, F, H, I, J) would produce a 3:1 ratio, whereas B, C, D, etc., may produce different ratios. But according to the question, the correct answer should be such that the parents produce a 3:1 ratio. Now, looking at the options, the ones that create a 3:1 ratio are A, E, G, F, H, I, J. However, the question asks for \"most likely\" which implies the most probable pair among these. But wait, maybe I need to think differently. Perhaps the parents are not necessarily both heterozygous.\n\nWait, another approach: The observed ratio is 3:1, which means the F1 generation is 3/4 B (black) and 1/4 b (white). To achieve this, each parent must contribute either B or b. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then F1 can be:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nWhich leads to 3/4 B and 1/4 b. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 would be:\n\n- From BB: BB (100%)\n- From Bb: Bb (50%) \u2192 all black, so F1 would be 100% B, which doesn't fit. Hence, parents cannot both be Bb and BB and Bb.\n\nWait, but option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is similar to A and E. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as A and E. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, same as A and E. So, all these pairs (except D and others) produce 3:1. But the question is asking for the most likely pair. However, in reality, any of these pairs (A, E, G, F, H, I, J) would produce the same 3:1 ratio. Therefore, perhaps the question is implying that the parents are likely both heterozygous, making option A (Bb \u00d7 Bb) the most likely because it's the simplest case where both parents are heterozygous for the trait. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that would not work because all offspring would be Bb, hence 100% black, which contradicts the observation. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb, again 100% black. So, the only way to get 3:1 is if both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nTherefore, the most likely parents are those who are both Bb, which corresponds to option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, looking back, some of these might not be accurate. For example, option C says bb \u00d7 Bb, but that doesn't seem right because the parents can't both be homozygous recessive (bb) and heterozygous (Bb) unless they're carriers. Similarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which makes sense because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, their offspring will be \u00bd Bb (which would then produce all B when crossed with another parent, but wait no, in a dihybrid cross, but here it's just a monohybrid cross, right?)\n\nWait, hold on, the question mentions a cross between two guinea pigs, but it doesn't specify whether it's a dihybrid or monohybrid cross. However, since there are four letters involved (like B and b), maybe it's a dihybrid cross involving two different genes, but perhaps in this case, it's a simple cross where each animal has a single gene for coat color, with alleles B and b.\n\nSo, assuming a monohybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio under ideal conditions is 3:1 (dominant:recessive). Here, it's 3:1 as well (black:white = 3:1), which matches. Now, the possible parents must produce an F1 generation where \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. Let me think about what combinations of parents would lead to that.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, like Aa \u00d7 Aa, you get a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's for multiple traits. But here, it's a single gene, so we need to consider a mono-hybrid cross. The key is that the parents should produce gametes that are 50% dominant (B) and 50% recessive (b). If both parents are Bb, then each gamete would have a 50% chance of being B or b. When they combine, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that gives a 3:1 ratio (BB and Bb have 3/4, and bb has 1/4), which matches our scenario. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the gametes would be B and B, resulting in all BB offspring, giving a 100% black coat, which doesn't fit. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving a 50:50 ratio, which also doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility is if both parents are Bb, leading to the 3:1 ratio. So, the parents' genotypes would be Bb \u00d7 Bb. That seems correct.\n\nLet me check the other options quickly. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Each parent can produce gametes: B and b. Combining them would give 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, same as above, giving 3:1 ratio. Wait, but does that make sense? Because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the F1 would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, which is 1:1, not 3:1. So, that wouldn't work. Hmm, wait, but if both parents are Bb, then the F1 is 75% Bb and 25% bb. Wait, but that's not exactly 3:1; instead, it's 3:1 because 75% Bb (which includes BB and Bb) and 25% bb. Wait, actually, the calculation is different. Let me clarify.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So, the Punnett square would be:\n\n   | B | b \n---|---|---\n B | BB | Bb \n b | Bb | bb \n\nSo, the ratios are:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nWhich translates to:\n- Phenotype: BB and Bb (both black): 75% \n- Phenotype: bb (white): 25%\n\nSo yes, 3:1 ratio. Therefore, parents Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce this ratio. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. No, wait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, earlier I thought option E was bb \u00d7 BB, but now I realize that option E is indeed bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce the same 3:1 ratio as option G (Bb \u00d7 BB). But according to my analysis, option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would also produce a 3:1 ratio, but wait, actually, no\u2014because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible gametes are B and Bb (wait, no, Bb can produce B and b). Wait, let me redo that.\n\nIf parent 1 is BB and parent 2 is Bb:\n\nParent 1 produces BB gametes (100%).\nParent 2 produces B and b gametes (each 50%).\n\nSo, the offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB \u00d7 B: BB\nFrom BB \u00d7 b: Bb\n\nSo, the F1 generation is 100% BB and 50% Bb.\n\nPhenotypes: BB (black) and Bb (black) \u2192 100% black. Which doesn't fit the scenario. Therefore, option E (bb \u00d7 BB) would result in 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As above, this would result in 100% BB and 50% Bb \u2192 100% black. Again, not matching.\n\nNow, going back, the initial analysis shows that option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would not produce the desired 3:1 ratio. Instead, option E (bb \u00d7 BB) would. But wait, I thought option E was bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce 50% Bb and 50% bb, hence 1:1. So, neither option E nor any of the others except option G?\n\nWait, no. Earlier I thought option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would produce 100% BB and 50% Bb, which is 100% black, which is not matching. So, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, no, because in option H, one parent is BB and the other is Bb. So, same as before, BB \u00d7 Bb would produce 100% BB and 50% Bb \u2192 100% black, which doesn't fit. So, that's incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the possibilities. Another way is to calculate the expected genotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe observed ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, so the parents must produce gametes such that when crossed, the F1 has \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nSince the coat color is determined by a single gene, let's denote B as the dominant allele and b as the recessive. The phenotype is determined by the genotype.\n\nFor a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive), the parents must produce gametes that are 50% B and 50% b. This happens when both parents are heterozygotes (Bb). Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, each parent contributes a 50% chance of B or b, leading to:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since BB and Bb are both black, and bb is white).\n\nTherefore, the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, looking back, some of these might not be accurate. For example, option C says bb \u00d7 Bb, but that doesn't seem right because the parents can't both be homozygous recessive (bb) and heterozygous (Bb) unless they're carriers. Similarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which makes sense because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, their offspring will be \u00bd Bb (which would then produce all B when crossed with another parent, but wait no, in a dihybrid cross, but here it's just a monohybrid cross, right?)\n\nWait, hold on, the question mentions a cross between two guinea pigs, but it doesn't specify whether it's a dihybrid or monohybrid cross. However, since there are four letters involved (like B and b), maybe it's a dihybrid cross involving two different genes, but perhaps in this case, it's a simple cross where each animal has a single gene for coat color, with alleles B and b.\n\nSo, assuming a monohybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio under ideal conditions is 3:1 (dominant:recessive). Here, it's 3:1 as well (black:white = 3:1), which matches. Now, the possible parents must produce an F1 generation where \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. Let me think about what combinations of parents would lead to that.\n\nIn a dihybrid cross, like Aa \u00d7 Aa, you get a 9:3:3:1 ratio, but that's for multiple traits. But here, it's a single gene, so we need to consider a mono-hybrid cross. The key is that the parents should produce gametes that are 50% dominant (B) and 50% recessive (b). If both parents are Bb, then each gamete would have a 50% chance of being B or b. When they combine, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n- bb (25%)\n\nBut wait, that gives a 3:1 ratio (BB and Bb have 3/4, and bb has 1/4), which matches our scenario. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the gametes would be B and B, resulting in all BB offspring, giving a 100% black coat, which doesn't fit. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving a 50:50 ratio, which also doesn't match.\n\nAnother possibility is if both parents are Bb, leading to the 3:1 ratio. So, the parents' genotypes would be Bb \u00d7 Bb. That seems correct.\n\nLet me check the other options quickly. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Each parent can produce gametes: B and b. Combining them would give 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, same as above, giving 3:1 ratio. Wait, but does that make sense? Because if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the F1 would be 50% Bb and 50% bb, which is 1:1, not 3:1. So, that wouldn't work. Hmm, wait, but if both parents are Bb, then the F1 is 75% Bb and 25% bb. Wait, but that's not exactly 3:1; instead, it's 3:1 because 75% Bb (which includes BB and Bb) and 25% bb. Wait, actually, the calculation is different. Let me clarify.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So, the Punnett square would be:\n\n   | B | b \n---|---|---\n B | BB | Bb \n b | Bb | bb \n\nSo, the ratios are:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nWhich translates to:\n- Phenotype: BB and Bb (both black): 75% \n- Phenotype: bb (white): 25%\n\nSo yes, 3:1 ratio. Therefore, parents Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce this ratio. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. No, wait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, earlier I thought option E was bb \u00d7 BB, but now I realize that option E is indeed bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce the same 3:1 ratio as option G (Bb \u00d7 BB). But according to my analysis, option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would also produce a 3:1 ratio, but wait, actually, no\u2014because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible gametes are B and Bb (wait, no, Bb can produce B and b). Wait, let me redo that.\n\nIf parent 1 is BB and parent 2 is Bb:\n\nParent 1 produces BB gametes (100%).\nParent 2 produces B and b gametes (each 50%).\n\nSo, the offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB \u00d7 B: BB\nFrom BB \u00d7 b: Bb\n\nSo, the F1 generation is 100% BB and 50% Bb.\n\nPhenotypes: BB (black) and Bb (black) \u2192 100% black. Which doesn't fit the scenario. Therefore, option E (bb \u00d7 BB) would result in 50% Bb and 50% bb, giving a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As above, this would result in 100% BB and 50% Bb \u2192 100% black. Again, not matching.\n\nNow, going back, the initial analysis shows that option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would not produce the desired 3:1 ratio. Instead, option E (bb \u00d7 BB) would. But wait, I thought option E was bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce 50% Bb and 50% bb, hence 1:1. So, neither option E nor any of the others except option G?\n\nWait, no. Earlier I thought option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would produce 100% BB and 50% Bb, which is 100% black, which is not matching. So, perhaps the correct answer is option H, which is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, no, because in option H, one parent is BB and the other is Bb. So, same as before, BB \u00d7 Bb would produce 100% BB and 50% Bb \u2192 100% black, which doesn't fit. So, that's incorrect.\n\nHmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the possibilities. Another way is to calculate the expected genotypic ratios based on the parents' genotypes.\n\nThe observed ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, so the parents must produce gametes such that when crossed, the F1 has \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nSince the coat color is determined by a single gene, let's denote B as the dominant allele and b as the recessive. The phenotype is determined by the genotype.\n\nFor a 3:1 ratio (dominant : recessive), the parents must produce gametes that are 50% B and 50% b. This happens when both parents are heterozygotes (Bb). Because when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, each parent contributes a 50% chance of B or b, leading to:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (since BB and Bb are both black, and bb is white).\n\nTherefore, the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option B seems a bit confusing because it lists four possibilities as the parents' genotypes. Maybe that's a typo, but perhaps each part refers to different possible pairs. Alternatively, maybe the intended answer is among these letters.\n\nSo, the key here is that the F1 generation should show a 3:1 ratio of black to white. For a dihybrid cross, like Bb \u00d7 Bb, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but that might not apply directly here since each parent is only contributing one allele. Wait, no\u2014each parent is a single animal, so their genotype determines the possible gametes they can produce. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce either B or b gametes. So, when they cross, the possible combinations would be:\n\nBB (if both give B), Bb (if one gives B and the other gives b), and bb (if both give b). The phenotypic ratio would then be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, the problem states that three-quarters have black, which would correspond to 75% BB + 50% Bb = 125%, but that doesn't make sense because total probability must sum to 100%. Hmm, maybe I got confused. Let me think differently.\n\nIf the parents are both Bb, then the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. So, the Punnett square would be:\n\nBb x Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). Phenotype-wise, BB and Bb are black, so 75% black, 25% white. That matches the problem statement. So, if both parents are Bb, the ratio is 3:1 black:white. So that would suggest that the correct genotype pair is option G, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nBut wait, let me check another possibility. Suppose one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Then, the possible gametes would be B (from BB) and B (from Bb), so only B. And the other parent would produce B and b. So, the offspring would get either B from both parents or B from the first and b from the second. So the genotypes would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%), leading to 75% black and 25% white. That also fits the observed ratio. So, another possible genotype pair is when one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Looking back at the options, option E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is similar to my previous thought. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would lead to the same outcome as E because swapping parents doesn't change the outcome. So, the parents could be either BB \u00d7 Bb or bb \u00d7 BB. Both would result in the same F1 ratio. However, looking at the options provided, the correct pair is either E or H. But the options don't include both together; perhaps they're listed separately. Wait, the options are individual letters, so each choice is a possible genotype pair. So, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, that's an option, but none of the options combine BB and Bb except via E or H. Therefore, the correct answer would involve one parent being BB and the other being Bb, making the genotype pair E or H.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, that would also work because each produces a 50% chance of giving B or b. So, that's another possibility. But looking at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which works too. So, now there are multiple possible answers based on the options. Wait, the question asks \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely,\" implying a single correct answer. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2013 leads to 75% black, 25% white.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 same as G because it's just the parents swapped.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2013 same as G.\n\nOptions A, C, D, F, I, J seem to describe other possible pairs. For example, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is G. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 75% bb (white) and 25% Bb (black). Wait, that's different. Because if one parent is bb and the other is Bb, then all the offspring would get b from the bb parent and either B or b from the Bb parent. So, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). Which is exactly the opposite of what's needed here. So, option C would give a 50-50 split instead of 75-25. Similarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would give 50% Bb and 50% bb, same as C. So, those wouldn't fit.\n\nOption E and H are swaps of BB \u00d7 Bb, which both would yield 75% black and 25% white. So, both E and H are correct in that aspect, but the way the options are presented, each letter represents a specific pair. So, the correct answer depends on whether the parents are both Bb (option G), or one is BB and the other is Bb (options E or H).\n\nLooking back, the original question says, \"The genotypes of the parents were most likely\" followed by options A-J. Each option describes a possible pair. Now, considering all the possibilities, the 3:1 ratio occurs when the parents are either both Bb (G) or a homozygous dominant (like BB) and a heterozygote (like Bb) (E or H). So, any of these pairs would result in the correct F1 ratio. However, since the options present each pair individually, the correct answer is that the parents are either both Bb (G), or one is BB and the other is Bb (E or H). But looking at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, both E and H are valid. However, the question is phrased as \"the genotypes of the parents were most likely,\" suggesting that only one option is correct. But in reality, there are multiple correct answers based on the options provided. However, the options may have been presented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, the F1 will be 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). That's correct. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 will be 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). So, both cases work. Now, looking at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is one case. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the other case. But both E and H are separate options. So, if the question allows for any of these, but the answer needs to be a single letter, perhaps the correct answer is E or H. However, the initial analysis suggested that both E and H are correct. But in the options, E and H are separate choices. So, perhaps the correct answer includes both, but since the user wants a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is G, assuming both parents are Bb. Alternatively, if the question expects one of the options to be the right one, then E and H are correct, but the options are presented as separate, so perhaps the intended answer is E or H, depending on the context.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the simplest explanation. If both parents are Bb, then each can contribute B or b, resulting in the 75% Bb and 25% bb. This leads to the correct ratio. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the F1 would also be 75% Bb and 25% bb. So, both scenarios are possible. However, looking back at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So, both E and H are valid, but the question requires selecting one. Perhaps the intended answer is E, but H is equally correct. Alternatively, the correct answer might be G, which covers both cases where the parents are Bb each. But since the options are presented as separate pairs, perhaps E and H are both correct, but the user expects us to choose one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is G, because it's more general, whereas E and H are specific instances.\n\nIn conclusion, the possible correct answers are G, E, and H, but since the options require selecting one, and the question is about the most likely, perhaps G is the best answer because it's a common scenario where both parents are Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white).

If both parents are Bb, then the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%) \n- Bb (50%) \n- bb (25%)\n\nBut since the coat color is determined by whether an animal has at least one B allele, the phenotypic ratio would be \u00be B (from BB and Bb) and \u00bc b (from bb). That matches the given \u00be black to \u00bc white. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, checking the answer choices, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb.

For a simple case where the trait is completely dominant, like if one allele is dominant and one is recessive, you can get a 3:1 ratio when you have two heterozygotes crossed (like Bb \u00d7 Bb). Because each parent can contribute either B or b, leading to four possible combinations:\n\n- B from first parent and B from second \u2192 BB (homozygous dominant)\n- B from first and b from second \u2192 Bb (heterozygous)\n- b from first and B from second \u2192 Bb \n- b from first and b from second \u2192 bb (homozygous recessive)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n- BB \u2192 black (if B is dominant)\n- Bb \u2192 black\n- bb \u2192 white\n\nThus, the ratio is 3 black : 1 white, which matches the given data. Now, checking the options, Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which fits perfectly. But wait, let me make sure there aren't any other possibilities.

Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, their offspring would be:\n\nEach parent gives one allele. So for BB:\n- First parent gives B\n- Second parent gives either B or b\n\nSo the offspring will have:\n- BB (from B and B)\n- Bb (from B and b)\n\nSimilarly, if the first parent is Bb and the second is Bb, the offsprings would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, resulting in 3:1. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be more than 75% black. Let's calculate:\n\nParent 1: BB \u2192 always B\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 can give B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes from Parent 2: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nOffspring genotypes:\n- From BB (always B) + B \u2192 BB (black)\n- From BB + b \u2192 Bb (black)\n- From Bb (B) + B \u2192 BB (black)\n- From Bb (b) + B \u2192 Bb (black)\n- From Bb (B) + b \u2192 Bb (black)\n- From Bb (b) + b \u2192 bb (white)\n\nSo the phenotypes would be:\n- BB, Bb, Bb, Bb, Bb, bb \u2192 thus, 4 black and 2 white.

Similarly, Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in 100% white offspring because bb is recessive, so that's 1:0, which doesn't fit. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all white, 1:0. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB; same as above. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would be 100% white.

Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo first, I need to figure out possible parent pairs that would produce \u00be black and \u00bc white offspring when crossed. Let's consider each option.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents have homozygous recessive alleles for the coat color. When they mate, all offspring will inherit bb, hence all will be bb, meaning all white coats. But in our case, there's \u00be black, so this can't be right. So D is out.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is homozygous recessive, the other is homozygous dominant. Cross results in 50% bb and 50% BB. Again, 50-50, not matching 75-25. So E is not correct.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, this is similar to D and E. Each parent is heterozygous for the trait, but in this case, one is homozygous recessive. So their offspring would have a 50% Bb (heterozygous, thus expressing the dominant trait) and 50% bb (recessive, white). That's the same as D, just the parents are switched. So F also doesn't fit because it would lead to 50-50 instead of 75-25.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E; one parent is dominant, the other homozygous dominant. Offspring are 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). Again, 50-50, no match.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is homozygous dominant, the other heterozygous. They should produce 50% BB and 50% Bb. Since BB produces black (dominant) and Bb also produces black (because B is dominant), all offspring would be black. So 100% black, which is way more than 75%. So H is incorrect.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Similar to E and F. Each parent contributes B or b. BB would give B to all offspring, and bb gives b. So 50% Bb (black) and 50% BB (black). Thus, all black. Not matching.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All offspring would get B from each parent, making them BB, all black. Again, 100%, so J is wrong.\n\nNow back to the remaining options: A, C, B, F. Wait, I think I missed some earlier. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nThe original options after E are F, G, H, I, J, etc., but perhaps I miscounted. Looking again, I see F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, I is BB \u00d7 bb, J is BB \u00d7 BB. So the remaining ones are A (Bb\u00d7Bb), C (bb\u00d7Bb).\n\nWait, earlier I thought that Bb\u00d7Bb would produce all Bb, thus all black. But wait, does that make sense? Let me think: if both parents are Bb, then the gametes would be B and b in equal proportions. So the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Since B is dominant, those with at least one B would express black. So BB and Bb would all be black, while bb would be white. Therefore, in this case, all offspring would be black, except for 25% who are white. But in the problem statement, we have \u00be black and \u00bc white. So that wouldn't match unless 25% of the offspring are white, which would require a different setup.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are Bb\u00d7BB. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB. Then the offspring would be B (from BB) and B or b (from Bb). So all offspring would get B from BB, and then half B and half b from Bb. So the genotypes would be 50% BB (black) and 50% Bb (black, since B is dominant). So all offspring are black, which contradicts the 75-25 ratio.\n\nWait, another approach: if the parents are Bb\u00d7Bb, then as I mentioned before, all offspring would be Bb (which is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb). So 75% BB and Bb (so black) and 25% bb (white). That matches exactly the 75% black and 25% white ratio observed. So in this case, the parents are Bb\u00d7Bb, which is option A.\n\nBut wait, hold on. Another possibility arises. Could the parents be BB\u00d7Bb? Because I initially ruled that out, but let's double-check. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the gametes from BB would be B, and from Bb would be B and b in equal amounts. So all offspring would receive B from BB, and B from Bb, resulting in all B. Thus, all offspring would be BB (black), leading to 100% black, which doesn't fit the data.\n\nSimilarly, if parents are Bb\u00d7BB, as discussed, all offspring would be B, so 100% black.\n\nIf parents are Bb\u00d7bb, then the offspring would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 50-50 ratio, which is less than the required 75-25. So that doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about parents being Bb\u00d7Bb? As previously said, all offspring are Bb, giving 75% black and 25% white. That fits perfectly.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer seems to be option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, the options seem a bit confusing because option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb, which might be a typo since it's an inbreeding cross, whereas the others are dihybrids or monohybrid crosses. Maybe I should focus on the correct format.\n\nSo, the possible parent pairs can be:\n\n- Both heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n- One homozygous dominant (BB) and one heterozygote (Bb)\n- One homozygous recessive (bb) and one heterozygote (Bb)\n\nGiven that the offspring have a 3:1 ratio, which is typical for a single gene where one allele is dominant, the parents must be heterozygous for that trait. Because if they were homozygous, like BB \u00d7 BB, then all offspring would be BB and thus have black coats, resulting in a 100% ratio, which doesn't fit here. Similarly, BB \u00d7 bb would produce 75% black and 25% white, which matches the 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the 3:1 ratio comes from a dihybrid cross, not a monohybrid. Hmm, maybe I need to think more clearly.\n\nWait, the cross here involves two guinea pigs, so it's probably a dihybrid cross if there's another gene involved, but the problem states that black is dominant over white, implying a single gene affecting coat color. Therefore, the parents could be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would give a 25% chance of producing bb (white) and 75% BB or Bb (black). But wait, the problem says both parents have black coats, so their genotype possibilities are either both Bb, or one BB and one Bb. If they're both Bb, then all offspring would be 25% bb, 50% Bb, 25% BB\u2014so 75% black and 25% white. That fits the description. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be 3/4 B (from BB) and 1/4 b (from Bb). So yes, that also gives a 3:1 ratio. Now, looking back at the answer choices, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all Bb offspring, hence 100% black. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black). Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as above. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as above. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as C. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same as C. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as D.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the most likely genotypes of the parents. So, considering that both parents have black coats, the possibilities are:\n\n- Both are Bb (option A)\n- One is BB and the other is Bb (options C, E, H)\n- Both are bb (option D)\n\nNow, the offspring ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. We've already established that if both parents are Bb (option A), the ratio is 3:1. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb (e.g., C, E, H), the ratio is still 3:1. However, if both parents are bb (option D), all offspring would be bb, resulting in 100% white, which doesn't match the data. Similarly, if both parents are bb, it's 100% white; if one is BB and the other is bb, the ratio is 75% B (black) and 25% bb (white). So, the possible parent combinations that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (BB \u00d7 Bb), E (BB \u00d7 bb), and H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Wait, but E is actually the same as C and H, just different phrasing. Wait, no\u2014E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is similar to C and H. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me clarify: the four scenarios leading to a 3:1 ratio are:\n\n1. Both parents are Bb (A): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n2. One parent is BB, the other is Bb (C, E, H): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n3. One parent is BB, the other is bb (E): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n4. One parent is bb, the other is BB (D): all bb, 100% white.\n\nBut according to the options provided, E is written as bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as option C (BB \u00d7 Bb). Wait, no\u2014the initial options are:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the options as:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, I see that E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C (if you switch the order) or option H. Wait, no\u2014Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb. Option E is written as bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C. So, options C and E refer to the same cross, just written differently. So, effectively, the relevant parent pairs that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (one Bb and one bb), and E (same as C). Or perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the possible combinations correctly.\n\nThe possible ways to get a 3:1 ratio are:\n\n- Both parents are Bb (A).\n- One parent is BB and the other is Bb (C and E, etc.), but writing it as Bb \u00d7 BB would be the same as BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as option C.\n- One parent is BB and the other is bb (E), which results in 75% B and 25% bb.\n- Both parents are bb (D), which results in 100% white.\n\nTherefore, among the options, A, C, E, and D are candidates. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype of the parents. Since the parents are both guinea pigs, and both have black coats, the most probable scenario is that both are Bb (A). Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb (C/E), but those are essentially the same as option C. However, the exact wording of the options may affect the selection.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option E is bb \u00d7 BB. These are the same crosses, just written differently. So, whether you write it as Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 BB, it's the same cross. Thus, the possible parent pairs that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (one Bb, one bb), and E (same as C). Additionally, option D leads to a 100% white coat, which doesn't fit the observed 3:1 ratio. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as C and E. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as C and E. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as C. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same as C and E. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which is option D.\n\nThus, the possible correct parent pairs are A (both Bb), F (Bb \u00d7 bb), G (Bb \u00d7 BB), H (BB \u00d7 Bb), I (BB \u00d7 bb), and J (BB \u00d7 BB). But the 3:1 ratio arises when either both parents are Bb (A), one parent is BB and the other is Bb (F/H), or one parent is BB and the other is bb (I/J).\n\nHowever, the question is about the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Among these, the most straightforward explanation is that both parents are Bb, which directly leads to a 3:1 ratio without any blending of alleles, which is why it's called a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is still 3:1. But in terms of the most likely scenario, both being Bb seems the simplest case, whereas one being BB and the other Bb requires an additional generation (like crossing a homozygous and a heterozygous), which is less common. Similarly, one being BB and the other being bb would require a self-pollination, which is rare. Therefore, the most likely parents are both Bb.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the phenotypic ratio and calculate expected ratios based on possible Punnett squares. For example, if both parents are Bb, the Punnett square would show 25% Bb (black), 25% BB (black), and 25% bb (white). Wait, no\u2014that would be incorrect because if both are Bb, then each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The phenotype would be black for all except bb, which is white. So the ratio would be 75% black, 25% white, matching the given data.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the Punnett square would show: \n- From BB: BB (100%) and Bb (100%)\n- From Bb: Bb (50%) and bb (50%)\n\nSo combining:\n- BB: 100%\n- Bb: 100 + 50 = 150% \u2192 but since it's combined, it's 50% from BB and 50% from Bb, totaling 100% B (black) and 50% bb (white). So the ratio is 100% black : 50% white, which doesn't fit the given 3:1 ratio. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought.\n\nWait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the Punnett square would yield:\n- BB (from BB) x Bb (from Bb): BB and Bb (each parent contributes one allele)\n- So, from BB: BB (25% from each gamete, but since it's homozygous, it's always BB)\n- From Bb: Bb (50% chance of passing B or b)\n\nSo the offspring will be:\n- BB (25% from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (50% from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (50% from Bb x Bb)\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me redo the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: BB (homozygous)\nParent 2: Bb (heterozygous)\n\nCross: BB x Bb\n\nEach gamete from BB is BB, and each gamete from Bb is Bb (but actually, Bb produces B and b gametes in equal proportion).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n- BB (from BB x Bb) \u2192 100% BB (since BB is always BB)\n- Bb (from Bb x Bb) \u2192 50% Bb (since Bb is 50% B and 50% b)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually the combination of gametes. Each gamete from BB is BB, and each gamete from Bb is Bb. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n          Gamete from Parent 1 | Gamete from Parent 2\n        --------------------------\n          BB (from Parent 1)   | BB (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n\nWait, that can't be right. The Punnett square for BB x Bb should be:\n\n      |       B    |       b\n      ---------------------\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n\nWait, that's five rows, but each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 (BB) contributes BB, Parent 2 (Bb) contributes B and b. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2): BB\nFrom BB and b: Bb\nFrom Bb (from Parent 2) and B: BB\nFrom Bb and b: Bb\n\nSo the possible genotypes are BB and Bb. The probability of BB is 25% (only when Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes B), and Bb is 75% (when Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b, or vice versa). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white), giving a 1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio.\n\nThis means that if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring won't have a 3:1 ratio but instead a 1:1:1 ratio. So the initial assumption that one parent is BB and the other is Bb leads to a different ratio than the observed one. Therefore, the parents must be such that neither is homozygous dominant nor homozygous recessive in a way that causes the 1:1:1 ratio. Instead, both parents must carry the dominant allele to prevent the blending of alleles.\n\nWait, going back, if both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square yields 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, which translates to 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb), which matches the given 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents must both be Bb (option A). Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio changes, so that scenario doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that one parent is BB and the other is bb, which would result in all offspring being Bb, hence 100% black, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb, which we saw leads to a 1:1:1 ratio. So the only way to get the 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb.\n\nAdditionally, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb, which is 100% black. Hence, that scenario doesn't fit. Therefore, the only viable option is that both parents are Bb, making the correct answer option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio becomes 1:1:1, which doesn't match the given 3:1. So the only way to achieve the 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb. Therefore, the answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, the options seem a bit confusing because option F is written as Bb \u00d7 bb, which might be a typo since it's an inbreeding cross, whereas the others are dihybrids or monohybrid crosses. Maybe I should focus on the correct format.\n\nSo, the possible parent pairs can be:\n\n- Both heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb)\n- One homozygous dominant (BB) and one heterozygote (Bb)\n- One homozygous recessive (bb) and one heterozygote (Bb)\n\nGiven that the offspring have a 3:1 ratio, which is typical for a single gene where one allele is dominant, the parents must be heterozygous for that trait. Because if they were homozygous, like BB \u00d7 BB, then all offspring would be BB and thus have black coats, resulting in a 100% ratio, which doesn't fit here. Similarly, BB \u00d7 bb would produce 75% black and 25% white, which matches the 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the 3:1 ratio comes from a dihybrid cross, not a monohybrid. Hmm, maybe I need to think more clearly.\n\nWait, the cross here involves two guinea pigs, so it's probably a dihybrid cross if there's another gene involved, but the problem states that black is dominant over white, implying a single gene affecting coat color. Therefore, the parents could be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would give a 25% chance of producing bb (white) and 75% BB or Bb (black). But wait, the problem says both parents have black coats, so their genotype possibilities are either both Bb, or one BB and one Bb. If they're both Bb, then all offspring would be 25% bb, 50% Bb, 25% BB\u2014so 75% black and 25% white. That fits the description. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be 3/4 B (from BB) and 1/4 b (from Bb). So yes, that also gives a 3:1 ratio. Now, looking back at the answer choices, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all Bb offspring, hence 100% black. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black). Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as above. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as above. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as C. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same as C. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as D.\n\nBut wait, the question asks about the most likely genotypes of the parents. So, considering that both parents have black coats, the possibilities are:\n\n- Both are Bb (option A)\n- One is BB and the other is Bb (options C, E, H)\n- Both are bb (option D)\n\nNow, the offspring ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white. We've already established that if both parents are Bb (option A), the ratio is 3:1. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb (e.g., C, E, H), the ratio is still 3:1. However, if both parents are bb (option D), all offspring would be bb, resulting in 100% white, which doesn't match the data. Similarly, if both parents are bb, it's 100% white; if one is BB and the other is bb, the ratio is 75% B (black) and 25% bb (white). So, the possible parent combinations that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (BB \u00d7 Bb), E (BB \u00d7 bb), and H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Wait, but E is actually the same as C and H, just different phrasing. Wait, no\u2014E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is similar to C and H. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me clarify: the four scenarios leading to a 3:1 ratio are:\n\n1. Both parents are Bb (A): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n2. One parent is BB, the other is Bb (C, E, H): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n3. One parent is BB, the other is bb (E): offspring 75% B, 25% bb.\n4. One parent is bb, the other is BB (D): all bb, 100% white.\n\nBut according to the options provided, E is written as bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as option C (BB \u00d7 Bb). Wait, no\u2014the initial options are:\n\nLooking back, the user provided the options as:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo, I see that E is bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C (if you switch the order) or option H. Wait, no\u2014Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb. Option E is written as bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as option C. So, options C and E refer to the same cross, just written differently. So, effectively, the relevant parent pairs that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (one Bb and one bb), and E (same as C). Or perhaps I'm getting confused here. Let me re-express the possible combinations correctly.\n\nThe possible ways to get a 3:1 ratio are:\n\n- Both parents are Bb (A).\n- One parent is BB and the other is Bb (C and E, etc.), but writing it as Bb \u00d7 BB would be the same as BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as option C.\n- One parent is BB and the other is bb (E), which results in 75% B and 25% bb.\n- Both parents are bb (D), which results in 100% white.\n\nTherefore, among the options, A, C, E, and D are candidates. However, the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype of the parents. Since the parents are both guinea pigs, and both have black coats, the most probable scenario is that both are Bb (A). Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb (C/E), but those are essentially the same as option C. However, the exact wording of the options may affect the selection.\n\nWait, looking at the options again, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option E is bb \u00d7 BB. These are the same crosses, just written differently. So, whether you write it as Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 BB, it's the same cross. Thus, the possible parent pairs that lead to a 3:1 ratio are A (both Bb), C (one Bb, one bb), and E (same as C). Additionally, option D leads to a 100% white coat, which doesn't fit the observed 3:1 ratio. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is the same as C and E. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as C and E. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as C. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same as C and E. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which is option D.\n\nThus, the possible correct parent pairs are A (both Bb), F (Bb \u00d7 bb), G (Bb \u00d7 BB), H (BB \u00d7 Bb), I (BB \u00d7 bb), and J (BB \u00d7 BB). But the 3:1 ratio arises when either both parents are Bb (A), one parent is BB and the other is Bb (F/H), or one parent is BB and the other is bb (I/J).\n\nHowever, the question is about the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" Among these, the most straightforward explanation is that both parents are Bb, which directly leads to a 3:1 ratio without any blending of alleles, which is why it's called a dihybrid cross. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is still 3:1. But in terms of the most likely scenario, both being Bb seems the simplest case, whereas one being BB and the other Bb requires an additional generation (like crossing a homozygous and a heterozygous), which is less common. Similarly, one being BB and the other being bb would require a self-pollination, which is rare. Therefore, the most likely parents are both Bb.\n\nAlternatively, another approach is to consider the phenotypic ratio and calculate expected ratios based on possible Punnett squares. For example, if both parents are Bb, the Punnett square would show 25% Bb (black), 25% BB (black), and 25% bb (white). Wait, no\u2014that would be incorrect because if both are Bb, then each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The phenotype would be black for all except bb, which is white. So the ratio would be 75% black, 25% white, matching the given data.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the Punnett square would show: \n- From BB: BB (100%) and Bb (100%)\n- From Bb: Bb (50%) and bb (50%)\n\nSo combining:\n- BB: 100%\n- Bb: 100 + 50 = 150% \u2192 but since it's combined, it's 50% from BB and 50% from Bb, totaling 100% B (black) and 50% bb (white). So the ratio is 100% black : 50% white, which doesn't fit the given 3:1 ratio. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous thought.\n\nWait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the Punnett square would yield:\n- BB (from BB) x Bb (from Bb): BB and Bb (each parent contributes one allele)\n- So, from BB: BB (25% from each gamete, but since it's homozygous, it's always BB)\n- From Bb: Bb (50% chance of passing B or b)\n\nSo the offspring will be:\n- BB (25% from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (50% from BB x Bb)\n- Bb (50% from Bb x Bb)\n\nWait, that doesn't sound right. Let me redo the Punnett square properly.\n\nParent 1: BB (homozygous)\nParent 2: Bb (heterozygous)\n\nCross: BB x Bb\n\nEach gamete from BB is BB, and each gamete from Bb is Bb (but actually, Bb produces B and b gametes in equal proportion).\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n- BB (from BB x Bb) \u2192 100% BB (since BB is always BB)\n- Bb (from Bb x Bb) \u2192 50% Bb (since Bb is 50% B and 50% b)\n\nWait, no\u2014it's actually the combination of gametes. Each gamete from BB is BB, and each gamete from Bb is Bb. So the Punnett square would be:\n\n          Gamete from Parent 1 | Gamete from Parent 2\n        --------------------------\n          BB (from Parent 1)   | BB (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n        BB (from Parent 1)     | Bb (from Parent 2)\n\nWait, that can't be right. The Punnett square for BB x Bb should be:\n\n      |       B    |       b\n      ---------------------\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n      B | BB     | Bb\n\nWait, that's five rows, but each parent contributes one allele. So Parent 1 (BB) contributes BB, Parent 2 (Bb) contributes B and b. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom BB (from Parent 1) and B (from Parent 2): BB\nFrom BB and b: Bb\nFrom Bb (from Parent 2) and B: BB\nFrom Bb and b: Bb\n\nSo the possible genotypes are BB and Bb. The probability of BB is 25% (only when Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes B), and Bb is 75% (when Parent 1 contributes B and Parent 2 contributes b, or vice versa). Therefore, the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white), giving a 1:1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the given 3:1 ratio.\n\nThis means that if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring won't have a 3:1 ratio but instead a 1:1:1 ratio. So the initial assumption that one parent is BB and the other is Bb leads to a different ratio than the observed one. Therefore, the parents must be such that neither is homozygous dominant nor homozygous recessive in a way that causes the 1:1:1 ratio. Instead, both parents must carry the dominant allele to prevent the blending of alleles.\n\nWait, going back, if both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square yields 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, which translates to 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb), which matches the given 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents must both be Bb (option A). Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio changes, so that scenario doesn't fit.\n\nAnother possibility is that one parent is BB and the other is bb, which would result in all offspring being Bb, hence 100% black, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb, which we saw leads to a 1:1:1 ratio. So the only way to get the 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb.\n\nAdditionally, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb, which is 100% black. Hence, that scenario doesn't fit. Therefore, the only viable option is that both parents are Bb, making the correct answer option A.\n\nWait, but earlier I considered that if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio becomes 1:1:1, which doesn't match the given 3:1. So the only way to achieve the 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb. Therefore, the answer should be option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might not make sense because when you cross two animals, each parent gives one allele. But maybe I should approach it differently. The possible genotypes for each parent must lead to a \u00be : \u00bc ratio in their offspring. Let's think about the Punnett square possibilities.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each parent can produce B and b alleles. The Punnett square would be:\n\nB | b  \nB | BB (25%) | Bb (50%)  \nb | Bb (50%) | bb (25%)\n\nSo combining the results, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (BB = black, Bb = black, bb = white). That fits exactly with the given data here\u2014\u00be black, \u00bc white. So if both parents are Bb, the answer would be G. Wait, but let me check if any other options also fit this ratio. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring will always get B from the Bb parent and b from the bb parent, resulting in Bb (black) every time. So the ratio would be 100%, which doesn't match the \u00be : \u00bc. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can give B or B from the first parent and B or b from the second. So the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Phenotype-wise, BB and Bb are black, so the ratio would be 3:1 as well. Therefore, both G and H would result in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, the cross is Bb x Bb, leading to 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross is Bb x bb, which results in all Bb (so 100% black). So neither G nor H alone would give \u00be : \u00bc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe there's another combination where one parent is Bb and the other is something else. Alternatively, considering another possibility: if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be BB x Bb. The offspring would receive B from the BB parent and B/b from the Bb parent. So the possible gametes are B from BB, B from Bb, and b from Bb. Wait, no, the parents are BB and Bb. So the BB parent can only contribute B, and the Bb parent can contribute B or b. So the offspring will be BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 B and 1/4 b, which matches the given data. So in this case, one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Looking back at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which leads to 100% black. Option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which leads to 3:1. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also leads to 3:1. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which leads to 100% black. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which leads to 100% black. So the correct options that produce \u00be : \u00bc are E (bb \u00d7 BB?) No, wait, E is bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, in my previous analysis, E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B from the BB parent and either B or b from the bb parent. So the offspring would be BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Thus, 3/4 BB and 1/4 Bb, which is 3:1. So E would produce a 3:1 ratio. Then, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also produces 3:1. So both E and H would work. Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\", which produces \u00be B and \u00bc b. Option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\", which also does that. So now I'm confused because the initial thought was that G and H would work, but upon rechecking, I see that E and H both would produce 3:1. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents, meaning which combination is more probable based on the observed outcome. Now, in reality, when you cross a parent with Bb and another with Bb, the 3:1 ratio occurs. When you cross a parent with BB and another with Bb, you still get 3:1. So both E and H would result in the same phenotype ratio. But in the options provided, E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" and H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". So both E and H are valid. However, since the question asks for the most likely genotype, perhaps they expect one specific answer. Alternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the options given.\n\nLooking back, the options are A-G, but the user provided several letters, including F to J. Wait, the original options were A-H, but the user listed up to J. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The possible answers include E (bb \u00d7 BB) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Both E and H would produce a \u00be : \u00bc ratio. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis. Let me go through the possibilities again.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. The offspring would be Bb, right? Because BB can only pass B, and bb can only pass b. So all offspring would be Bb, which is 100% black. So that wouldn't fit the \u00be : \u00bc ratio. Wait, so I was wrong before. Option E would produce 100% black, not \u00be. So that's incorrect. So I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me correct myself.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross is BB \u00d7 Bb. The offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB: B\n\nFrom Bb: B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes are B (from BB) and B/b (from Bb).\n\nThus, the offspring would be:\n\nB + B = BB (25%)\n\nB + b = Bb (50%)\n\nAnd the third possibility is that the B from BB and the b from Bb combine to form Bb, so total 3/4 BB and 1/4 Bb. Hence, 3:1 ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in 3:1 ratio.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, which ones result in 3:1?\n\n- Option D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 All bb, 100%.\n- Option E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 All Bb, 100%.\n- Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 75% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 100% BB.\n- Option J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 100%.\n\nTherefore, the correct options that produce a \u00be : \u00bc ratio are F, G, H. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype of the parents. Now, among these, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Which one is more likely to occur?\n\nIn general, the probability of getting a certain genotype depends on the parents' genotypes. For instance, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the chance of getting an offspring with B or b is 75% B and 25% b, leading to 3:1. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring will always be Bb, leading to 100%. But wait, in reality, the parents are usually homozygous for one trait, like BB and Bb, or Bb and Bb. So which of these combinations is more likely?\n\nWait, but according to the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Now, considering that in nature, the more common genotype would be Bb \u00d7 Bb, producing 3:1. However, sometimes a Bb parent and a bb parent can also produce 3:1. But generally, the majority of such cases involve two Bb parents. So, among the options, G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would both produce 3:1. However, looking at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB, which produces 100% black, which doesn't fit. So the options that produce 3:1 are F, G, H.\n\nBut the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, so which pair is more likely. From the options, G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) are both plausible. But wait, if the parents are Bb and Bb, the offspring are 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, same thing. If one is Bb and the other is bb, it's 100% Bb. If one is BB and the other is Bb, same as above. So the correct options are G, H, F. But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I corrected that earlier. So, going back, the correct options that result in 3:1 are F, G, H. Among these, the most likely parents would be those who are both Bb, i.e., G, or one Bb and one BB, i.e., H. But without knowing the exact parents, we can't say definitively. However, the question provides multiple options, and in typical problems, the expected answer is often G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) because it's the most common scenario where both parents are heterozygous for a single trait. Alternatively, H (BB \u00d7 Bb) could also be considered, but BB is homozygous dominant, which may not be typical in this context.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, options F, G, and H all produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype of the parents,\" implying that perhaps only one of these is possible. But looking at the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Of these, G and H are both possible. But perhaps the intended answer is E, which I initially thought was wrong, but after correcting, it's clear that E is 100% Bb, which doesn't fit. So the correct options are F, G, and H.\n\nHowever, the question lists the options as A to J, with F being Bb \u00d7 bb and G being Bb \u00d7 Bb. Among these, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the most likely scenario in many genetic scenarios, especially when both parents are heterozygous for the same trait. Therefore, the correct answer would be G (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might not make sense because when you cross two animals, each parent gives one allele. But maybe I should approach it differently. The possible genotypes for each parent must lead to a \u00be : \u00bc ratio in their offspring. Let's think about the Punnett square possibilities.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each parent can produce B and b alleles. The Punnett square would be:\n\nB | b  \nB | BB (25%) | Bb (50%)  \nb | Bb (50%) | bb (25%)\n\nSo combining the results, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (BB = black, Bb = black, bb = white). That fits exactly with the given data here\u2014\u00be black, \u00bc white. So if both parents are Bb, the answer would be G. Wait, but let me check if any other options also fit this ratio. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring will always get B from the Bb parent and b from the bb parent, resulting in Bb (black) every time. So the ratio would be 100%, which doesn't match the \u00be : \u00bc. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can give B or B from the first parent and B or b from the second. So the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Phenotype-wise, BB and Bb are black, so the ratio would be 3:1 as well. Therefore, both G and H would result in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no, wait. Let me double-check. If both parents are Bb, the cross is Bb x Bb, leading to 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the cross is Bb x bb, which results in all Bb (so 100% black). So neither G nor H alone would give \u00be : \u00bc. Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe there's another combination where one parent is Bb and the other is something else. Alternatively, considering another possibility: if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be BB x Bb. The offspring would receive B from the BB parent and B/b from the Bb parent. So the possible gametes are B from BB, B from Bb, and b from Bb. Wait, no, the parents are BB and Bb. So the BB parent can only contribute B, and the Bb parent can contribute B or b. So the offspring will be BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). So the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 B and 1/4 b, which matches the given data. So in this case, one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Looking back at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, option E is bb \u00d7 BB. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which leads to 100% black. Option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which leads to 3:1. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also leads to 3:1. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which leads to 100% black. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which leads to 100% black. So the correct options that produce \u00be : \u00bc are E (bb \u00d7 BB?) No, wait, E is bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, in my previous analysis, E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B from the BB parent and either B or b from the bb parent. So the offspring would be BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Thus, 3/4 BB and 1/4 Bb, which is 3:1. So E would produce a 3:1 ratio. Then, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also produces 3:1. So both E and H would work. Wait, but let me check the options again. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\", which produces \u00be B and \u00bc b. Option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\", which also does that. So now I'm confused because the initial thought was that G and H would work, but upon rechecking, I see that E and H both would produce 3:1. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents, meaning which combination is more probable based on the observed outcome. Now, in reality, when you cross a parent with Bb and another with Bb, the 3:1 ratio occurs. When you cross a parent with BB and another with Bb, you still get 3:1. So both E and H would result in the same phenotype ratio. But in the options provided, E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" and H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". So both E and H are valid. However, since the question asks for the most likely genotype, perhaps they expect one specific answer. Alternatively, perhaps I need to reconsider the options given.\n\nLooking back, the options are A-G, but the user provided several letters, including F to J. Wait, the original options were A-H, but the user listed up to J. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything. The possible answers include E (bb \u00d7 BB) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb). Both E and H would produce a \u00be : \u00bc ratio. But wait, perhaps I made a mistake in my earlier analysis. Let me go through the possibilities again.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. The offspring would be Bb, right? Because BB can only pass B, and bb can only pass b. So all offspring would be Bb, which is 100% black. So that wouldn't fit the \u00be : \u00bc ratio. Wait, so I was wrong before. Option E would produce 100% black, not \u00be. So that's incorrect. So I must have miscalculated earlier. Let me correct myself.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross is BB \u00d7 Bb. The offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB: B\n\nFrom Bb: B or b\n\nSo the possible gametes are B (from BB) and B/b (from Bb).\n\nThus, the offspring would be:\n\nB + B = BB (25%)\n\nB + b = Bb (50%)\n\nAnd the third possibility is that the B from BB and the b from Bb combine to form Bb, so total 3/4 BB and 1/4 Bb. Hence, 3:1 ratio.\n\nSimilarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in 3:1 ratio.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, which ones result in 3:1?\n\n- Option D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 All bb, 100%.\n- Option E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 All Bb, 100%.\n- Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 75% Bb, 25% bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n- Option I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 100% BB.\n- Option J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 100%.\n\nTherefore, the correct options that produce a \u00be : \u00bc ratio are F, G, H. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype of the parents. Now, among these, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Which one is more likely to occur?\n\nIn general, the probability of getting a certain genotype depends on the parents' genotypes. For instance, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the chance of getting an offspring with B or b is 75% B and 25% b, leading to 3:1. Similarly, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring will always be Bb, leading to 100%. But wait, in reality, the parents are usually homozygous for one trait, like BB and Bb, or Bb and Bb. So which of these combinations is more likely?\n\nWait, but according to the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Now, considering that in nature, the more common genotype would be Bb \u00d7 Bb, producing 3:1. However, sometimes a Bb parent and a bb parent can also produce 3:1. But generally, the majority of such cases involve two Bb parents. So, among the options, G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would both produce 3:1. However, looking at the options, E is bb \u00d7 BB, which produces 100% black, which doesn't fit. So the options that produce 3:1 are F, G, H.\n\nBut the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, so which pair is more likely. From the options, G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and H (BB \u00d7 Bb) are both plausible. But wait, if the parents are Bb and Bb, the offspring are 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, same thing. If one is Bb and the other is bb, it's 100% Bb. If one is BB and the other is Bb, same as above. So the correct options are G, H, F. But the question is multiple-choice, so perhaps I missed something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I corrected that earlier. So, going back, the correct options that result in 3:1 are F, G, H. Among these, the most likely parents would be those who are both Bb, i.e., G, or one Bb and one BB, i.e., H. But without knowing the exact parents, we can't say definitively. However, the question provides multiple options, and in typical problems, the expected answer is often G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) because it's the most common scenario where both parents are heterozygous for a single trait. Alternatively, H (BB \u00d7 Bb) could also be considered, but BB is homozygous dominant, which may not be typical in this context.\n\nWait, but according to my analysis, options F, G, and H all produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype of the parents,\" implying that perhaps only one of these is possible. But looking at the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Of these, G and H are both possible. But perhaps the intended answer is E, which I initially thought was wrong, but after correcting, it's clear that E is 100% Bb, which doesn't fit.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nHmm, okay. I need to figure out which pair of parents would produce these offspring ratios. Since both parents are involved, I should consider pairs where their possible gametes combine in such a way as to produce \u00be B and \u00bc b. Let me think about each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. If both parents are heterozygotes, then when they cross, the F1 generation will show a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the parents themselves are Bb, so their offspring (assuming no other factors like sex linkage) would be Bb (for the coat color gene) because each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the cross would give four possible combinations: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, according to the problem statement, the offspring are \u00be black and \u00bc white, which doesn't match. Because BB is black, Bb is black, and bb is white. So, the expected ratio would be 3/4 B and 1/4 b, which matches the problem's description. However, wait\u2014no, hold on. If both parents are Bb, then the F1 would actually be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, the phenotype would be 75% black and 25% white. That does fit the 3:1 ratio described in the problem. So, maybe option A is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought comes up. If both parents are Bb, then their cross would indeed yield 3/4 B and 1/4 b. So, why would any other option make sense? Let me check others just to be sure.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This seems complicated because there are two separate crosses here. Let's see: the first cross is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous for the dominant allele, so all offspring would be BB. The second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent produces gametes: B and b. So, the F1 would be Bb (from B\u00d7b and b\u00d7b). The phenotypic ratio would be 50% B and 50% b. So combining the two sets of results: all BB plus half BB and half bb. So the overall ratio would be 75% BB and 25% bb. Converting to coat colors, since BB is black and bb is white, it'd be 75% black and 25% white. But wait, the problem states that both parents are black, but in this case, the offspring are also mostly black except for some white. So, this doesn't fit the initial setup because the parents are both black, but the cross involves different genotype pairs. It might complicate things further, but perhaps the answer is still A.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). When they cross, the possible gametes are b (from bb) and B (from Bb). So, the offspring would receive either a B or a b allele from each parent. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\nParent 1: bb (always gives b)\nParent 2: Bb (can give B or b)\n\nSo the cross would produce:\n- b (from bb) \u00d7 B \u2192 Bb\n- b (from bb) \u00d7 b \u2192 bb\n\nSo the F1 generation is 25% BB (but wait, no\u2014if you get b from the first parent and B from the second, you get Bb; if you get b from both, you get bb). So the phenotypes would be 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches exactly the problem's description: \u00be black, \u00bc white. Now, what's the genotype of the parents? One parent is bb (homozygous recessive), and the other is Bb (heterozygous). So the parents' genotypes would be bb and Bb. Looking back at the options, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\". So that fits perfectly.\n\nBut wait, earlier I considered option A as well. So now I'm confused because both A and C seem to produce the same outcome. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed, the F1 would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Phenotype-wise, that's 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). So that matches the problem's description. So, why is option C also a possibility?\n\nAh, because in option C, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), while the other is heterozygous (Bb). So the parents are Bb and bb. Therefore, the parents' genotypes are Bb and bb, making option C the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: the question says \"the most likely\" pair. So, which pair among the options would correctly predict the 3:1 ratio? Option A and C both lead to the 3:1 ratio. So why is the answer not both A and C? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, no, the question asks for the genotypes of the parents, implying a specific pair. So, perhaps more than one option leads to the correct ratio, but the question expects us to choose between the letters. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one of them is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in evaluating the other options.\n\nLet me go through the other options quickly:\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. If both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning 100% white coats. Doesn't match the problem.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Parents are bb and BB. Cross would produce Bb (phenotype black) and bb (phenotype white). So, 3:1 ratio. The parents' genotypes are bb and BB. So this is a valid option, but let me note it.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Same as option E, but the parents are Bb and bb. Cross would produce 3:1, same as above.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Parent 1 is Bb, parent 2 is BB. Cross would produce Bb and Bb. So all offspring would be Bb, hence 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Parent 1 is BB, parent 2 is Bb. Cross would produce B and Bb. The F1 would be 50% B (from BB + Bb) and 50% Bb (from Bb + Bb). Phenotype-wise, 75% B and 25% b. So this would also fit the 3:1 ratio. The parents' genotypes are BB and Bb. So this is another correct option.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Parent 1 is BB, parent 2 is bb. Cross would produce B and bb. All offspring would be B (from BB) and bb (from Bb). So 100% black and 25% white. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are BB. All offspring would be BB, so 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, several options (A, E, F, H) lead to a 3:1 ratio. But the question asks which is the most likely pair. However, the options provided include multiple possibilities, but the question is phrased as \"most likely\", suggesting that perhaps only one option is correct. Let me re-examine each option.\n\nLooking back at option C: bb \u00d7 Bb. The parents are bb and Bb. Their cross would produce 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black). So, yes, that's the correct ratio.\n\nIn option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. The cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, same as above.\n\nOptions E and F: Bb \u00d7 bb and Bb \u00d7 BB, respectively. Both produce 3:1 ratio.\n\nOptions H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Also produces 3:1.\n\nSo, all options A, E, F, H produce the correct 3:1 ratio. But the question is asking which pair was the most likely. However, in reality, multiple pairs can result in the same ratio. So, perhaps the question expects us to pick the pair that includes one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous. Which of the options is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2013 both heterozygous.\nE: bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant.\nF: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2013 one heterozygote and one homozygote.\nH: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2013 one homozygous dominant and one heterozygote.\n\nSo, options E, F, and H involve one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous, whereas option A is both heterozygotes. Similarly, option C is one homozygous recessive and one heterozygote.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps any of these pairs could result in the observed ratio. But the question is about which pair is most likely. However, without additional information, it's impossible to determine uniquely. But perhaps the intended answer is option C because it explicitly shows the presence of a recessive allele in the offspring, leading to the 25% white coat. Alternatively, option A also shows that.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of a recessive allele in the parents leads to the 25% white. So, both A and C have a homozygous recessive parent and a heterozygous parent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it directly reflects the 3:1 ratio without ambiguity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual genetic principles. The 3:1 ratio arises when one parent is homozygous recessive (e.g., bb) and the other is heterozygous (e.g., Bb). This ensures that every offspring receives a B from one parent and a b from the other, resulting in 75% B (black) and 25% b (white).\n\nTherefore, the correct parent pairs are those involving one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous. Among the options, only option C fits this criteria (bb \u00d7 Bb) and the others don't necessarily fit unless they are both heterozygotes or involve homozygous dominant.\n\nSo, the answer must be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Let me think about each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. If both parents are heterozygotes, then when they cross, the F1 generation will show a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014the parents themselves are Bb, so their offspring (assuming no other factors like sex linkage) would be Bb (for the coat color gene) because each parent can contribute either B or b. So, the cross would give four possible combinations: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, according to the problem statement, the offspring are \u00be black and \u00bc white, which doesn't match. Because BB is black, Bb is black, and bb is white. So, the expected ratio would be 3/4 B and 1/4 b, which matches the problem's description. However, wait\u2014no, hold on. If both parents are Bb, then the F1 would actually be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, the phenotype would be 75% black and 25% white. That does fit the 3:1 ratio described in the problem. So, maybe option A is correct.\n\nWait, but another thought comes up. If both parents are Bb, then their cross would indeed yield 3/4 B and 1/4 b. So, why would any other option make sense? Let me check others just to be sure.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This seems complicated because there are two separate crosses here. Let's see: the first cross is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous for the dominant allele, so all offspring would be BB. The second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent produces gametes: B and b. So, the F1 would be Bb (from B\u00d7b and b\u00d7b). The phenotypic ratio would be 50% B and 50% b. So combining the two sets of results: all BB plus half BB and half bb. So the overall ratio would be 75% BB and 25% bb. Converting to coat colors, since BB is black and bb is white, it'd be 75% black and 25% white. But wait, the problem states that both parents are black, but in this case, the offspring are also mostly black except for some white. So, this doesn't fit the initial setup because the parents are both black, but the cross involves different genotype pairs. It might complicate things further, but perhaps the answer is still A.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Here, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), and the other is heterozygous (Bb). When they cross, the possible gametes are b (from bb) and B (from Bb). So, the offspring would receive either a B or a b allele from each parent. The Punnett square would look like this:\n\nParent 1: bb (always gives b)\nParent 2: Bb (can give B or b)\n\nSo the cross would produce:\n- b (from bb) \u00d7 B \u2192 Bb\n- b (from bb) \u00d7 b \u2192 bb\n\nSo the F1 generation is 25% BB (but wait, no\u2014if you get b from the first parent and B from the second, you get Bb; if you get b from both, you get bb). So the phenotypes would be 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white). This matches exactly the problem's description: \u00be black, \u00bc white. Now, what's the genotype of the parents? One parent is bb (homozygous recessive), and the other is Bb (heterozygous). So the parents' genotypes would be bb and Bb. Looking back at the options, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\". So that fits perfectly.\n\nBut wait, earlier I considered option A as well. So now I'm confused because both A and C seem to produce the same outcome. Let me double-check.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. As discussed, the F1 would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Phenotype-wise, that's 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). So that matches the problem's description. So, why is option C also a possibility?\n\nAh, because in option C, one parent is homozygous recessive (bb), while the other is heterozygous (Bb). So the parents are Bb and bb. Therefore, the parents' genotypes are Bb and bb, making option C the correct answer.\n\nBut wait, let me confirm: the question says \"the most likely\" pair. So, which pair among the options would correctly predict the 3:1 ratio? Option A and C both lead to the 3:1 ratio. So why is the answer not both A and C? Or am I missing something?\n\nWait, no, the question asks for the genotypes of the parents, implying a specific pair. So, perhaps more than one option leads to the correct ratio, but the question expects us to choose between the letters. But looking back at the options, perhaps only one of them is correct. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in evaluating the other options.\n\nLet me go through the other options quickly:\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. If both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning 100% white coats. Doesn't match the problem.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Parents are bb and BB. Cross would produce Bb (phenotype black) and bb (phenotype white). So, 3:1 ratio. The parents' genotypes are bb and BB. So this is a valid option, but let me note it.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Same as option E, but the parents are Bb and bb. Cross would produce 3:1, same as above.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Parent 1 is Bb, parent 2 is BB. Cross would produce Bb and Bb. So all offspring would be Bb, hence 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Parent 1 is BB, parent 2 is Bb. Cross would produce B and Bb. The F1 would be 50% B (from BB + Bb) and 50% Bb (from Bb + Bb). Phenotype-wise, 75% B and 25% b. So this would also fit the 3:1 ratio. The parents' genotypes are BB and Bb. So this is another correct option.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb. Parent 1 is BB, parent 2 is bb. Cross would produce B and bb. All offspring would be B (from BB) and bb (from Bb). So 100% black and 25% white. Doesn't match.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are BB. All offspring would be BB, so 100% black. Doesn't match.\n\nSo, several options (A, E, F, H) lead to a 3:1 ratio. But the question asks which is the most likely pair. However, the options provided include multiple possibilities, but the question is phrased as \"most likely\", suggesting that perhaps only one option is correct. Let me re-examine each option.\n\nLooking back at option C: bb \u00d7 Bb. The parents are bb and Bb. Their cross would produce 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black). So, yes, that's the correct ratio.\n\nIn option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. The cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, same as above.\n\nOptions E and F: Bb \u00d7 bb and Bb \u00d7 BB, respectively. Both produce 3:1 ratio.\n\nOptions H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Also produces 3:1.\n\nSo, all options A, E, F, H produce the correct 3:1 ratio. But the question is asking which pair was the most likely. However, in reality, multiple pairs can result in the same ratio. So, perhaps the question expects us to pick the pair that includes one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous. Which of the options is that?\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2013 both heterozygous.\nE: bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 homozygous recessive and homozygous dominant.\nF: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2013 one heterozygote and one homozygote.\nH: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2013 one homozygous dominant and one heterozygote.\n\nSo, options E, F, and H involve one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous, whereas option A is both heterozygotes. Similarly, option C is one homozygous recessive and one heterozygote.\n\nNow, considering that, perhaps any of these pairs could result in the observed ratio. But the question is about which pair is most likely. However, without additional information, it's impossible to determine uniquely. But perhaps the intended answer is option C because it explicitly shows the presence of a recessive allele in the offspring, leading to the 25% white coat. Alternatively, option A also shows that.\n\nWait, but in reality, the presence of a recessive allele in the parents leads to the 25% white. So, both A and C have a homozygous recessive parent and a heterozygous parent. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C because it directly reflects the 3:1 ratio without ambiguity.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the actual genetic principles. The 3:1 ratio arises when one parent is homozygous recessive (e.g., bb) and the other is heterozygous (e.g., Bb). This ensures that every offspring receives a B from one parent and a b from the other, resulting in 75% B (black) and 25% b (white).\n\nTherefore, the correct parent pairs are those involving one homozygous recessive and one heterozygous. Among the options, only option C fits this criteria (bb \u00d7 Bb) and the others don't necessarily fit unless they are both heterozygotes or involve homozygous dominant.\n\nSo, the answer must be option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

That complicates things a bit because each option represents a possible pair of parents, and I need to figure out which pair produces a 3:1 ratio in the offspring.\n\nFirst, the basic setup is a dihybrid cross where both parents have at least one dominant allele for the coat color. Since the trait is determined by one gene, the parents must contribute alleles such that when combined, they produce the observed ratio. So, the parents must be heterozygous for that gene\u2014meaning each parent is Bb. Because if both parents were homozygous for the dominant allele (BB), then all their offspring would be BB and thus have black coats, resulting in a 100% BB ratio, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio here. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would have varying ratios. Wait, let me think more clearly.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then each parent can give either B or b. So the possible gametes are 50% B and 50% b. When you combine two Bb parents, the Punnett square shows four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Now, since B is dominant over b, the coat color will be black if the genotype is BB or Bb, and white only if it's bb. So in this case, the expected ratio is 3/4 black (BB + Bb = 75%) and 1/4 white (bb). That matches exactly with the question: three quarters black, one quarter white. Therefore, both parents must be Bb. But wait, looking back at the answer choices, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Hmm, wait, no\u2014the answer options don't include \"both parents are Bb\" as an option; instead, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, but that would lead to a different ratio. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, no, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring would be: BB (from B\u00d7B) and Bb (from B\u00d7b). So the phenotypes would be BB (black) and Bb (black), meaning all offspring would be black, leading to a 100% black coat ratio. That doesn't fit our data. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then the ratio is indeed 3:1. So option G says Bb \u00d7 BB, which I thought might be incorrect because that should give 100% black. So maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider other possibilities. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). So the phenotypic ratio would be 75% black and 25% brown/brown, assuming B is dominant. That doesn't align with the given 3:1 ratio. On the other hand, if both parents are Bb, then the ratio is indeed 3:1. So among the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which I think is incorrect because it should produce 100% black. However, another possibility is that the correct pair is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let me see: if one parent is BB (always black) and the other is Bb (can pass B or b), then the possible offspring are BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Again, 75% black, 25% brown. Doesn't fit.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm misunderstanding the scenario. Maybe the parents are both Bb, making the ratio 3:1. Then the correct option would be G: Bb \u00d7 BB. No, wait, no, G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Earlier analysis said that would give 100% black. So why is the correct option H?\n\nWait, maybe I should approach this differently. Let me calculate the probability for each possible parent combination.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb (white). Ratio is 100% white. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. One parent is homozygous recessive, the other is homozygous dominant. All offspring would be Bb (since bb + BB gives Bb). Phenotype is black. So ratio is 100% black. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. One parent is Bb, the other is bb. Possible offspring are Bb (if parent 1 passes B and parent 2 passes b) or bb (parent 1 passes b and parent 2 passes b). So 25% Bb (black) and 75% bb (white). Ratio is 3:1. Perfect! So this option fits perfectly.\n\nSo the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 bb. Looking at the answer options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which matches.

However, in reality, there are four possible genotype pairs for two parents when considering each parent's genotype individually.\n\nBut maybe I should think differently. Since all the offspring have a \u00be chance of being black, their genotypes must have at least one dominant allele (B) in each case. Because if an individual had two recessive alleles (bb), they'd be white. So the parents must contribute at least one B allele each. That means that neither parent can be homozygous recessive (bb). So looking at the options, any pair involving a bb genotype would not produce any white offspring, but since all are white in 25%, that implies that neither parent is bb. Therefore, any option where both parents are bb (like D: bb \u00d7 bb) would produce all bb offspring, i.e., 100% white. So D is not correct.\n\nSo now, let's consider the remaining options where both parents don't contribute a b allele. That leaves us with F, G, H, I, and J, because options C, E, B, etc., include bb as one parent. So focusing on those:\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb  \nIf one parent is Bb and the other is bb. When you cross Bb \u00d7 bb, the possible gametes are B and b. So the offspring would get either Bb (from B gamete + b from bb) or bb (from b gamete + b from bb).

Cross Bb \u00d7 BB: gametes from BB are B and B. From Bb, gametes are B and b. So the offspring will have either BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Both BB and Bb will be black, so all offspring would be black. That doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nSame as above, just swapping the parents.

Each parent produces B and b gametes in equal frequency. So when crossing, 50% of the offspring get B from Bb and b from bb, making Bb (black). 50% get b from Bb and b from bb, making bb (white).

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and J is BB \u00d7 BB. But since the parents can be any combination, maybe some of these pairs produce different ratios.\n\nLet me think about possible parent combinations. If both parents are homozygous for the same genotype, like BB and BB, then all their offspring will be BB (homozygous dominant), resulting in 100% BB. That doesn't match our observed 75-25 ratio. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 3/4 BB and 1/4 bB (which would express as Bb?), wait no\u2014wait, the presence of the dominant allele results in the phenotype. So if an animal has at least one dominant allele, they show the dominant trait (black). So in the case where parents are BB and Bb:\n\nParent 1: BB  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nThe possible gametes from Parent 1 are all B, and from Parent 2 are B and b. So each offspring gets a B from Parent 1 and either B or b from Parent 2. So the possible genotypes are BB (if they get B from both) and Bb (if they get b from Parent 2). Both BB and Bb would express black, so all offspring would be black. Again, 100% black, not matching the 75-25 ratio. So that pair won't work.\n\nWhat if the parents are Bb and Bb? Then, using a Punnett square, each offspring has a 25% chance of being BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, bb would express as white because it's recessive. Wait no\u2014the phenotype depends on whether there's at least one dominant allele. So in Bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring would have 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that gives a ratio of 3:1, which matches the 75-25 observed. So this seems promising.\n\nBut hold on, the question is asking about the most likely genotype of the parents, meaning which combination is more probable. So if the parents are both Bb (option G), then that's the correct answer. Alternatively, looking at other options: option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the possible gametes from Bb are B and b, and from bb, it's only b. So the offspring would have Bb (with B from Bb and b from bb) and bb (from Bb and b from bb). So the phenotypes would be 3/4 Bb (black) and 1/4 bb (white). Which also gives a 3:1 ratio. So both option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would lead to the same 3:1 ratio. Hmm, but the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype. Now, when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, both parents contribute B alleles, leading to all offspring having at least one B, hence all black. Whereas Bb \u00d7 bb would result in half Bb (black) and half bb (white). So why would the parents be Bb \u00d7 Bb instead of Bb \u00d7 bb?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the likelihood based on the information provided. The parents are crossing two guinea pigs, both with black coats. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, all their offspring would be B_ (heterozygous), so all black. But if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then some would be Bb (black) and some bb (white). But according to the problem statement, all the offspring are either black or white, with 75% black and 25% white. So the 75-25 ratio implies that each offspring has a 75% chance of being B_, which happens when parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because in Bb \u00d7 Bb, every offspring must receive at least one B, so all are B_. When parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, each offspring has a 50% chance of being Bb and 50% of being bb. Therefore, 50% of the offspring would be B_ (black) and 50% bb (white). But the problem says 75% black and 25% white, which doesn't fit into this scenario.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me double-check. If parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the ratio is 100% B_. If parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the ratio is 50% B_ and 50% bb. But the problem states 75% black and 25% white. So neither of these scenarios fits. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me go back.\n\nOh wait, maybe I was wrong about the expected ratio. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, all offspring are B_, giving 100% black. But the problem says 75% black and 25% white. So that means the parents can't be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because that would give all black. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem says 75% black and 25% white. So that can't be right. Maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but then why does the problem say 75% black? Unless I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem says 75% black, which would require all offspring to be B_. But that contradicts my previous reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem is presented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this systematically. Let's calculate the expected phenotypic ratio for each option.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nEach parent can produce B or b gametes. All offspring will get B from both parents, making all B_. Phenotype: 100% black.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring genotypes are BB and Bb. So phenotypes: BB (black) and Bb (black). So all offspring are black, 100% black. Not matching 75%.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nParents are bb (homozygous recessive) and Bb (heterozygous). Possible gametes: from bb, only b; from Bb, B and b. So offspring are Bb (phenotype: black) and bb (phenotype: white). So ratio 3:1 (75% black, 25% white).\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb  \nBoth parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring are bb, which expresses as white. Ratio: 100% white.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB  \nSame as option C, just swapped. Parents are bb and BB. Gametes: from bb, b; from BB, B. Offspring: Bb (black) and bb (white). 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb  \nAs above, 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nAll offspring B_, 100% black.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nParents are BB and Bb. Gametes: from BB, B; from Bb, B and b. Offspring: BB (B_) and Bb (B_), so all B_, 100% black.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb  \nParents are BB and bb. Gametes: B from BB, b from bb. Offspring: Bb (B_), so 100% black.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB  \nAll offspring BB, 100% black.\n\nSo from this analysis, the only options that result in a 3:1 ratio are options C and F, which are bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb, respectively. However, the problem mentions that the parents were crossed to produce both black and white animals, implying that both possibilities exist among the offspring. So both C and F are valid, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. \n\nNow, considering the options, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb (option G), all offspring are B_, which would result in 100% black. But the problem states that 75% are black and 25% are white, so option G cannot be the correct answer. Similarly, if the parents are BB \u00d7 BB (option H), all offspring are BB (black), which is 100% black. So neither H nor G are correct. \n\nOptions C and F result in 75% black and 25% white. Now, the question is, which combination is more likely given the observed ratio. Let me think about whether the parents could have been Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb. Why might the parents be Bb \u00d7 Bb instead of Bb \u00d7 bb?\n\nWell, if the parents are both heterozygous (Bb), then all offspring will be B_, so 100% black. But the problem shows a mixture of black and white, so that can't be the case. Hence, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, which one leads to a 75% black and 25% white ratio? Well, regardless of the order, the outcome is the same. So both C and F are correct, but the question is multiple choice, so I need to choose between them.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's something else. Let me check the dihybrid cross again. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the F1 generation would have 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that's 75% black, 25% white. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So that's also 75% black, 25% white. So both cases result in the same ratio. Therefore, both C and F are correct. But in the options, both C and F are present. Wait, looking back at the original options:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo options C and F are present. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype of the parents, given that the offspring exhibit 75% black and 25% white. Since both C and F result in the same ratio, but the parents themselves differ in their genotype. So the question is, which combination is more likely. \n\nIn reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, all offspring are B_, so 100% black. But the problem shows a mix, so the parents can't be both Bb. Therefore, the parents must be one Bb and one bb, which would produce 3:1 ratio. So either option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) or F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would be correct. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype,\" implying a specific pair. \n\nLooking back, the options are individual choices, so the correct answers would be either C or F. But since the user asked for a single-letter answer, and both C and F are options, perhaps I need to consider whether the parents could be BB \u00d7 Bb (option H), but that would only give 50% B_, which is not the case here. So probably, the parents are either C or F. \n\nWait, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. So, in reality, if the parents are both Bb, all offspring are black. But since the observed ratio includes both black and white, the parents can't both be Bb. Hence, the parents must include at least one bb. So, either C or F applies. But without additional information, such as the presence of a recessive allele, we can't distinguish between C and F. However, since both result in the same ratio, perhaps the correct answer is either C or F. \n\nBut looking back, the options are separate letters, so perhaps only one of them is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the Punnett squares.\n\nFor option C: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nPossible gametes: bb (only b) and Bb (B and b). So offspring:\n- Bb (from B from Bb and b from bb): black  \n- Bb (from B from Bb and b from bb): black  \n- Bb (from B from Bb and B from Bb): black  \n- bb (from b from bb and B from Bb): black  \nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Let me do it properly. Each parent produces gametes:\n\nParent 1 (bb): always produces b.  \nParent 2 (Bb): produces B or b with equal probability.  \n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom Bb (parent 2) and b (parent 1):\n- Bb (phenotype: black) occurs 50% of the time.  \nAnd from bb (parent 1) and B (parent 2):  \n- Bb (phenotype: black) occurs 50% of the time.  \nSimilarly, from bb and b: all bb (white).  \n\nWait, that's not right. Let me represent it correctly. The Punnett square for bb \u00d7 Bb would be:\n\n```\n   | B   | b  \n---|-----|----  \n B  | BB  | Bb \n---|-----|----  \n b  | Bb  | bb \n```\n\nSo the four possible offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Thus, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So the ratio is 3:1 (75% black, 25% white). \n\nSimilarly, for Bb \u00d7 bb, the Punnett square is:\n\n```\n   | B   | b  \n---|-----|----  \n B  | BB  | Bb \n---|-----|----  \n b  | Bb  | bb \n```\n\nSame as above, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So both cases result in the same ratio. Therefore, both C and F are correct. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype, which may depend on the presence of certain alleles. Without additional info, perhaps both are correct, but in the context of the options, perhaps only one is presented. Looking back, the options are:\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \n\nThey are essentially the same, just swapped. So in the answer key, both would be considered correct, but since the system expects a single letter, perhaps I need to pick one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Bb \u00d7 bb, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question specifies that the parents are crossed to produce both black and white animals, which requires that at least one parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). So the correct answer would be either C or F. But since the user is expecting a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is F. Bb \u00d7 bb. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the presence of the recessive allele, it's necessary for the white coat to appear. So perhaps the correct answer is C. bb \u00d7 Bb. \n\nWait, but without knowing the exact setup, I'm a bit stuck. However, given the analysis, both C and F yield the same ratio, but perhaps the question expects the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that doesn't fit the observed data. So I think the correct answer is that the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So in the case where parents are BB and Bb:\n\nParent 1: BB  \nParent 2: Bb  \n\nThe possible gametes from Parent 1 are all B, and from Parent 2 are B and b. So each offspring gets a B from Parent 1 and either B or b from Parent 2. So the possible genotypes are BB (if they get B from both) and Bb (if they get b from Parent 2). Both BB and Bb would express black, so all offspring would be black. Again, 100% black, not matching the 75-25 ratio. So that pair won't work.\n\nWhat if the parents are Bb and Bb? Then, using a Punnett square, each offspring has a 25% chance of being BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, bb would express as white because it's recessive. Wait no\u2014the phenotype depends on whether there's at least one dominant allele. So in Bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring would have 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that gives a ratio of 3:1, which matches the 75-25 observed. So this seems promising.\n\nBut hold on, the question is asking about the most likely genotype of the parents, meaning which combination is more probable. So if the parents are both Bb (option G), then that's the correct answer. Alternatively, looking at other options: option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the possible gametes from Bb are B and b, and from bb, it's only b. So the offspring would have Bb (with B from Bb and b from bb) and bb (from Bb and b from bb). So the phenotypes would be 3/4 Bb (black) and 1/4 bb (white). Which also gives a 3:1 ratio. So both option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would lead to the same 3:1 ratio. Hmm, but the question asks for the \"most likely\" genotype. Now, when you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, both parents contribute B alleles, leading to all offspring having at least one B, hence all black. Whereas Bb \u00d7 bb would result in half Bb (black) and half bb (white). So why would the parents be Bb \u00d7 Bb instead of Bb \u00d7 bb?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider the likelihood based on the information provided. The parents are crossing two guinea pigs, both with black coats. So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, all their offspring would be B_ (heterozygous), so all black. But if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, then some would be Bb (black) and some bb (white). But according to the problem statement, all the offspring are either black or white, with 75% black and 25% white. So the 75-25 ratio implies that each offspring has a 75% chance of being B_, which happens when parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because in Bb \u00d7 Bb, every offspring must receive at least one B, so all are B_. When parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, each offspring has a 50% chance of being Bb and 50% of being bb. Therefore, 50% of the offspring would be B_ (black) and 50% bb (white). But the problem says 75% black and 25% white, which doesn't fit into this scenario.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Let me double-check. If parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the ratio is 100% B_. If parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, the ratio is 50% B_ and 50% bb. But the problem states 75% black and 25% white. So neither of these scenarios fits. Wait, did I make a mistake earlier? Let me go back.\n\nOh wait, maybe I was wrong about the expected ratio. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, all offspring are B_, giving 100% black. But the problem says 75% black and 25% white. So that means the parents can't be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Because that would give all black. So perhaps I made a miscalculation earlier.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem says 75% black and 25% white. So that can't be right. Maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but then why does the problem say 75% black? Unless I've misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, another possibility: Perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem says 75% black, which would require all offspring to be B_. But that contradicts my previous reasoning. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but the problem is presented differently.\n\nWait, perhaps I should approach this systematically. Let's calculate the expected phenotypic ratio for each option.\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nEach parent can produce B or b gametes. All offspring will get B from both parents, making all B_. Phenotype: 100% black.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible offspring genotypes are BB and Bb. So phenotypes: BB (black) and Bb (black). So all offspring are black, 100% black. Not matching 75%.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nParents are bb (homozygous recessive) and Bb (heterozygous). Possible gametes: from bb, only b; from Bb, B and b. So offspring are Bb (phenotype: black) and bb (phenotype: white). So ratio 3:1 (75% black, 25% white).\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb  \nBoth parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring are bb, which expresses as white. Ratio: 100% white.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB  \nSame as option C, just swapped. Parents are bb and BB. Gametes: from bb, b; from BB, B. Offspring: Bb (black) and bb (white). 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb  \nAs above, 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nAll offspring B_, 100% black.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb  \nParents are BB and Bb. Gametes: from BB, B; from Bb, B and b. Offspring: BB (B_) and Bb (B_), so all B_, 100% black.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb  \nParents are BB and bb. Gametes: B from BB, b from bb. Offspring: Bb (B_), so 100% black.\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB  \nAll offspring BB, 100% black.\n\nSo from this analysis, the only options that result in a 3:1 ratio are options C and F, which are bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb, respectively. However, the problem mentions that the parents were crossed to produce both black and white animals, implying that both possibilities exist among the offspring. So both C and F are valid, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. \n\nNow, considering the options, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb (option G), all offspring are B_, which would result in 100% black. But the problem states that 75% are black and 25% are white, so option G cannot be the correct answer. Similarly, if the parents are BB \u00d7 BB (option H), all offspring are BB (black), which is 100% black. So neither H nor G are correct. \n\nOptions C and F result in 75% black and 25% white. Now, the question is, which combination is more likely given the observed ratio. Let me think about whether the parents could have been Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 bb. Why might the parents be Bb \u00d7 Bb instead of Bb \u00d7 bb?\n\nWell, if the parents are both heterozygous (Bb), then all offspring will be B_, so 100% black. But the problem shows a mixture of black and white, so that can't be the case. Hence, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 bb or bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, which one leads to a 75% black and 25% white ratio? Well, regardless of the order, the outcome is the same. So both C and F are correct, but the question is multiple choice, so I need to choose between them.\n\nWait, but perhaps there's something else. Let me check the dihybrid cross again. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, the F1 generation would have 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So that's 75% black, 25% white. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). So that's also 75% black, 25% white. So both cases result in the same ratio. Therefore, both C and F are correct. But in the options, both C and F are present. Wait, looking back at the original options:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo options C and F are present. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype of the parents, given that the offspring exhibit 75% black and 25% white. Since both C and F result in the same ratio, but the parents themselves differ in their genotype. So the question is, which combination is more likely. \n\nIn reality, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, all offspring are B_, so 100% black. But the problem shows a mix, so the parents can't be both Bb. Therefore, the parents must be one Bb and one bb, which would produce 3:1 ratio. So either option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) or F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would be correct. However, the question is phrased as \"the most likely genotype,\" implying a specific pair. \n\nLooking back, the options are individual choices, so the correct answers would be either C or F. But since the user asked for a single-letter answer, and both C and F are options, perhaps I need to consider whether the parents could be BB \u00d7 Bb (option H), but that would only give 50% B_, which is not the case here. So probably, the parents are either C or F. \n\nWait, but the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. So, in reality, if the parents are both Bb, all offspring are black. But since the observed ratio includes both black and white, the parents can't both be Bb. Hence, the parents must include at least one bb. So, either C or F applies. But without additional information, such as the presence of a recessive allele, we can't distinguish between C and F. However, since both result in the same ratio, perhaps the correct answer is either C or F. \n\nBut looking back, the options are separate letters, so perhaps only one of them is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the Punnett squares.\n\nFor option C: bb \u00d7 Bb  \nPossible gametes: bb (only b) and Bb (B and b). So offspring:\n- Bb (from B from Bb and b from bb): black  \n- Bb (from B from Bb and b from bb): black  \n- Bb (from B from Bb and B from Bb): black  \n- bb (from b from bb and B from Bb): black  \nWait, no\u2014that\u2019s incorrect. Let me do it properly. Each parent produces gametes:\n\nParent 1 (bb): always produces b.  \nParent 2 (Bb): produces B or b with equal probability.  \n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nFrom Bb (parent 2) and b (parent 1):\n- Bb (phenotype: black) occurs 50% of the time.  \nAnd from bb (parent 1) and B (parent 2):  \n- Bb (phenotype: black) occurs 50% of the time.  \nSimilarly, from bb and b: all bb (white).  \n\nWait, that's not right. Let me represent it correctly. The Punnett square for bb \u00d7 Bb would be:\n\n```\n   | B   | b  \n---|-----|----  \n B  | BB  | Bb \n---|-----|----  \n b  | Bb  | bb \n```\n\nSo the four possible offspring are BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. Thus, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So the ratio is 3:1 (75% black, 25% white). \n\nSimilarly, for Bb \u00d7 bb, the Punnett square is:\n\n```\n   | B   | b  \n---|-----|----  \n B  | BB  | Bb \n---|-----|----  \n b  | Bb  | bb \n```\n\nSame as above, 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So both cases result in the same ratio. Therefore, both C and F are correct. But the question is asking for the most likely genotype, which may depend on the presence of certain alleles. Without additional info, perhaps both are correct, but in the context of the options, perhaps only one is presented. Looking back, the options are:\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \n\nThey are essentially the same, just swapped. So in the answer key, both would be considered correct, but since the system expects a single letter, perhaps I need to pick one. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Bb \u00d7 bb, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, the question specifies that the parents are crossed to produce both black and white animals, which requires that at least one parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). So the correct answer would be either C or F. But since the user is expecting a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is F. Bb \u00d7 bb. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the presence of the recessive allele, it's necessary for the white coat to appear. So perhaps the correct answer is C. bb \u00d7 Bb. \n\nWait, but without knowing the exact setup, I'm a bit stuck. However, given the analysis, both C and F yield the same ratio, but perhaps the question expects the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that doesn't fit the observed data. So I think the correct answer is that the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce a B or b gamete. When they mate, the Punnett square would show four possibilities:\n\n- B/B \u2192 BB (homozygous dominant, black)\n- B/b \u2192 Bb (heterozygous, black)\n- b/B \u2192 Bb (same as above)\n- b/b \u2192 bb (homozygous recessive, white)\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). That gives a 3:1 ratio of black:white, which matches the problem statement perfectly. So option A seems correct because both parents are Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio when crossed.\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusions, let me check other options just in case. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent would contribute either B or b. Parent 1 (Bb) can give B or b; parent 2 (bb) can only give b. So the offspring would be Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black (dominant) and bb is white. So the ratio would be 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio. So F is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic applies here. Each parent can only contribute b or B. Offspring would be bb (white) and BB (black), giving a 50:50 ratio again. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so every offspring will be bb. That's all white, which is not matching.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. As we saw earlier, this leads to a 25:50:25 ratio of black:black:white. Correct.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E and D, leading to 50:50 ratio.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. This is similar to option A but reversed. Each parent can contribute B or b. Parent 1 (BB) always gives B, and parent 2 (Bb) can give B or b. So offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Thus, the ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So same as option A, just swapped. But since the parents are the same regardless of order, the ratio remains the same.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the most likely genotype pair. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would lead directly to the 3:1 ratio without any exceptions. Other options like option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) or E (bb \u00d7 BB) don't achieve the desired ratio.\n\nLet me also think about whether there's another possibility. For instance, if the parents are different, say one is BB and the other is Bb, does that change anything? No, because crossing a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb) still results in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the possible gametes from the first parent are B, and from the second are B and b. So the offspring would be BB (from B and B), Bb (from B and b), and Bb (from b and B). So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB and 75% Bb, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't work.\n\nSimilarly, if both parents are Bb, the 3:1 ratio holds. So option A is definitely correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, B is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, C is bb \u00d7 Bb, D is bb \u00d7 bb, E is bb \u00d7 BB, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, I is BB \u00d7 bb, and J is BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nFirst, let me consider the possible parents and their gametes. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce a B or b gamete. When they mate, the Punnett square would show four possibilities:\n\n- B/B \u2192 BB (homozygous dominant, black)\n- B/b \u2192 Bb (heterozygous, black)\n- b/B \u2192 Bb (same as above)\n- b/b \u2192 bb (homozygous recessive, white)\n\nSo, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). That gives a 3:1 ratio of black:white, which matches the problem statement perfectly. So option A seems correct because both parents are Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio when crossed.\n\nWait, but before jumping to conclusions, let me check other options just in case. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent would contribute either B or b. Parent 1 (Bb) can give B or b; parent 2 (bb) can only give b. So the offspring would be Bb and bb. Phenotype-wise, Bb is black (dominant) and bb is white. So the ratio would be 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio. So F is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic applies here. Each parent can only contribute b or B. Offspring would be bb (white) and BB (black), giving a 50:50 ratio again. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so every offspring will be bb. That's all white, which is not matching.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. As we saw earlier, this leads to a 25:50:25 ratio of black:black:white. Correct.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Same as E and D, leading to 50:50 ratio.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. This is similar to option A but reversed. Each parent can contribute B or b. Parent 1 (BB) always gives B, and parent 2 (Bb) can give B or b. So offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). Thus, the ratio is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So same as option A, just swapped. But since the parents are the same regardless of order, the ratio remains the same.\n\nBut wait, the question is about the most likely genotype pair. Option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would lead directly to the 3:1 ratio without any exceptions. Other options like option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) or E (bb \u00d7 BB) don't achieve the desired ratio.\n\nLet me also think about whether there's another possibility. For instance, if the parents are different, say one is BB and the other is Bb, does that change anything? No, because crossing a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb) still results in a 3:1 ratio. Wait, no\u2014let me clarify. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the possible gametes from the first parent are B, and from the second are B and b. So the offspring would be BB (from B and B), Bb (from B and b), and Bb (from b and B). So the phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB and 75% Bb, which is a 1:3 ratio, not 3:1. So that wouldn't work.\n\nSimilarly, if both parents are Bb, the 3:1 ratio holds. So option A is definitely correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

But since the question asks for \"most likely,\" perhaps we need to figure out the possible genotype pairs that can produce the observed phenotypic ratio.\n\nLet me think about what causes a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. That seems like a 3:1 ratio, which typically comes from a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous for the same trait, resulting in all four possible genotypes being present equally, but since the phenotype depends on at least one dominant allele, only the ones with at least one dominant will show the phenotype. Wait no, in a dihybrid cross, when you have two independently assorting genes, say for height and shape, a dihybrid cross (like F1 x F1) would give 9 possible outcomes, but considering dominance, the phenotypic ratio changes. Alternatively, maybe this is a monohybrid cross?\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a test cross, but more likely, considering the parents, they might be heterozygotes for the same gene. So let me consider the possible options:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. If both parents are heterozygotes for a single gene, then their offspring would have a 25% Bb, 50% B_, 25% _b. But wait, coat color here\u2014so if black is dominant, any B_ would express black. So the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 black (BB and B_) and 1/4 white (_b). So this matches exactly the data given: \u00be black, \u00bc white. So option A would produce the correct ratio.\n\nBut wait, let me check another possibility just to make sure. Option G is also Bb \u00d7 BB. So one parent is Bb, the other is BB. So the offspring would get B from the BB parent and b or B from the Bb parent. So the genotypes would be Bb and BB. When it comes to coat color, BB would be black, and Bb would also be black because B is dominant. So all offspring would be black, which doesn't match the data. So option G wouldn't work.\n\nSimilarly, option D: bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, which would be white. That's not matching.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. So parents are bb and BB. The offspring would get b from the bb parent and B from the BB parent, so all would be Bb, which is black. Again, all black, which is wrong.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb. Similarly, all offspring would be Bb, which is black. So that's incorrect.\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb. Offspring would get B from BB and B or b from Bb. So possible genotypes: BB (if B from Bb) or Bb (if b from Bb). All would be B_, so black. Incorrect.\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Parents are Bb and bb. Offspring would get B from Bb and b from bb, making Bb (black) half the time and bb (white) half the time. So 50% black, 50% white.

In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",
    "chunk_resampled": "A. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.",
    "rollout": " \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, actually the user presented the possible answers as letters A to J, but some of these seem to be pairs, while others might just be individual genotypes. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify whether the correct answer is a genotype (like option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is a cross), or an individual genotype (like option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is another cross). But looking back, the user wrote \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\" and then listed options like A. Bb \u00d7 Bb etc., so they're presenting all possible cross combinations as separate possibilities. Therefore, each option represents a possible pair of parents.\n\nSo, my task is to figure out which of these pairs when crossed will produce a \u00be black and \u00bc white offspring ratio. Alternatively, since all options represent different cross combinations, I can evaluate each one to see if their expected offspring ratios match the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nLet me recall that for a monohybrid cross where the dominant allele is B and the recessive is b, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant : recessive). However, here the phenotype is based on coat color, which is also determined by a single gene. So, the possible outcomes depend on the parents' genotypes.\n\nSince the parents are both guinea pigs, let's assume they're homozygous for the same alleles unless stated otherwise. Wait, but the parents aren't necessarily homozygous. The parents could be heterozygous (Bb) or homozygous recessive (bb).\n\nLooking at the observed ratio: \u00be black, \u00bc white. That's a 3:1 ratio, similar to a typical monohybrid cross. For a monohybrid cross with a Bb x Bb, the expected ratio is indeed 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, their offspring should have a 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if both parents are Bb, any cross among them would yield a 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any exceptions. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the expected ratio would be 2:1 (BB : Bb), not 3:1. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the ratio would be 1:1 (BB : bb). On the other hand, if both parents are bb, all offspring would be bb, resulting in a 100% white coat. That doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 ratio. This fits because crossing two heterozygotes gives a 3:1 outcome.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Hmm, this seems to involve multiple crosses. Let me think: BB \u00d7 BB would give all Bb offspring? No, wait, BB \u00d7 BB would produce all BB offspring. Then Bb \u00d7 bb would produce a 1:1 ratio of Bb : bb, leading to 1/4 Bb and 1/4 bb. So combining these, you'd have 1/4 BB (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 1/4 Bb (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 1/4 Bb (from BB \u00d7 bb) plus 1/4 bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb). So the total would be 2/4 BB + 2/4 (Bb + bb) = 2/4 BB + 2/4 Bb (since bb is all white). Wait, that would make the phenotypic ratio 1:1 (BB and Bb are black, bb is white), which is 50-50 instead of 3:1. So option B's offspring wouldn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me redo the analysis. Option B lists two crosses: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. The first cross (BB \u00d7 BB) produces all BB. The second cross (Bb \u00d7 bb) produces a 3:1 ratio, which would be 3 parts Bb and 1 part bb. But wait, the second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce 25% Bb and 25% bb. So the combined offspring would be 100% of BB (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 25% Bb (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 25% Bb (from BB \u00d7 bb) plus 25% bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb). So total BB: 25%, Bb: 50%, and bb: 25%. Thus, phenotypically, BB and Bb (black) and bb (white), giving a 3:1 ratio (75% black, 25% white). Wait, that's exactly the ratio observed! So why am I confused?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. When you perform multiple crosses, the offspring are all produced from those crosses. So for option B, the two parents are BB and Bb and bb? Or is it BB \u00d7 BB and then Bb \u00d7 bb? Actually, no. Option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\", which implies two separate crosses. The first cross is BB \u00d7 BB, which results in all BB. The second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which results in a 3:1 ratio of Bb : bb. Combining these, the total number of offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB \u00d7 BB: 100% BB (so 100% black).\nFrom Bb \u00d7 bb: 75% Bb (so 75% black) and 25% bb (so 25% white).\nTotal black: 100% + 75% = 175%?\nWait, no, percentages don't add beyond 100. So the actual proportion is: 100% of BB (which is 100%) plus 75% of Bb (so 75% more than the first cross) plus 25% of bb (so 25% more than the first cross). But this is impossible because you can't have more than 100% in reality. So perhaps I've misapplied it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way to approach this is to consider that each cross produces its own set of offspring, and the overall population includes all of them. But that complicates things, and typically, when someone presents such a setup, it refers to a single cross involving multiple parents or a single cross with multiple parents involved, but that's usually represented differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider the options again.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 This is a cross between a homozygous recessive (bb) and a heterozygote (Bb). The expected ratio is 1:1 (B : b), so 75% B and 25% b. Phenotypically, B would be black, and b would be white. So the ratio would be 3:1 (75% black, 25% white). That matches our observed ratio. So why is option C being considered later?\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 All offspring would be bb, hence all white. Not matching.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cross between homozygous recessive (bb) and homozygous dominant (BB). Expected ratio is 1:1 (B : b), so 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). Again, 3:1 ratio. So this would also fit. So now I'm seeing options C, E, and possibly others.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement, the parents are crossed once, producing all their offspring. So if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option C, the offspring would have a 1:1 ratio (B : b), thus 3:1 phenotypic ratio. Similarly, if the parents are bb \u00d7 BB (option E), the same applies. So both C and E would produce a 3:1 ratio. Now, looking at the options provided, both C and E are present as options.\n\nSimilarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would also result in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps multiple options could lead to the desired ratio. However, the question asks which was the most likely, implying only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to look for a specific pattern in the parents' genotypes.\n\nAnother angle: the observed ratio is \u00be black, \u00bc white, which is a 3:1 ratio. The standard dihybrid cross yields a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering two traits, but here it's a single trait. Wait, no, it's still a single trait, so the basic idea is that the parents must contribute alleles in a way that leads to a 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then their cross would produce 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), the ratio is 1:1. So, for a 3:1 ratio, both parents must be heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or perhaps one parent is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, but if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would produce a 2:2 ratio (B : b), leading to 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). So that's not a 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is bb, the cross would produce 25% B (from BB \u00d7 bb), but the other parents would produce 25% bb. So the ratio would be 25% B : 75% bb, which is 1:3, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Wait, no, that's 1:3, meaning 25% B (75%) and 25% bb (25%). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), their cross would result in all offspring being B (since BB \u00d7 Bb would produce BB (from BB) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb)). So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% black, which is not the case here. So that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb, making the cross produce 3:1 (75% B, 25% b). Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb would not work because that would produce a 2:2 ratio, which is 75% B and 25% b, but wait, that's not the case. Because BB \u00d7 Bb would produce BB (from BB \u00d7 Bb) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb). So the proportion would be 100% BB (100% B) and 50% Bb (50% B and 50% b). So total would be 150% B and 50% b, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no. The cross of BB \u00d7 Bb would produce four gametes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and Bb (50%). Wait, no, wait. BB is 100% gamete B; Bb is 50% B and 50% b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb:\nBB (from BB \u00d7 B)\nBb (from BB \u00d7 b)\nBb (from Bb \u00d7 B)\nBb (from Bb \u00d7 b)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes. The father (BB) produces only B gametes. The mother (Bb) produces B (25%) and b (75%). So the Punnett square would be:\n\nFather: B\nMother: Bb\n\nPossible gametes:\nB (25%), b (75%)\n\nCrossing B \u00d7 Bb:\nEach gamete combines with each allele.\n- From B (25%): B \u00d7 B = BB (25%), B \u00d7 b = Bb (25%)\n- From b (75%): B \u00d7 b = Bb (75%); b \u00d7 b = bb (75%)\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\nBB (25%), Bb (25% + 75%) = 100%, and bb (75%).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 75% B (BB and Bb) and 25% b (bb). Which is 3:1. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, if both parents are Bb, the cross produces a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 2:2, which is 75% B and 25% b, but that's not 3:1. Wait, no, wait\u2014when you cross BB (100% B) with Bb (50% B, 50% b), the resulting genotypes are:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb:\nAll offspring inherit B from the father and either B or b from the mother.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are BB (25%) and Bb (75%). So the phenotypic ratio is 75% B and 25% b, which is 3:1. Wait, that's interesting. Because the parents are BB and Bb, the cross would produce a 3:1 ratio. So both the cases where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, or both parents are Bb, would result in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut according to the initial problem statement, the parents are both guinea pigs with black coats. It doesn't specify whether they're homozygous or heterozygous. So, if they're both Bb, then the cross would give a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb, the same happens.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the cross of BB \u00d7 Bb, I got a 75% B and 25% b ratio, which is 3:1. So both scenarios where the parents are Bb and Bb, or BB and Bb, would result in a 3:1 ratio. So both options C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) would produce a 3:1 ratio, along with option H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut looking back at the options, the user presented all possible cross combinations, including each parent being homozygous or heterozygous. So, which of these options is correct?\n\nWait, the problem states that the parents are both guinea pigs, both with black coats. So, they could be either:\n\n1. Both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) \u2192 cross produces 3:1.\n2. One heterozygous (Bb) and one homozygous (BB) \u2192 cross produces 3:1.\n3. Both homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb) \u2192 cross produces 100% white, which is incorrect.\n4. Other possibilities may exist.\n\nHowever, the options given include both Bb \u00d7 Bb and bb \u00d7 Bb as valid options. But in reality, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. So, why are they presented separately?\n\nIn the context of the problem, the parents are both black-coated. They could be either Bb \u00d7 Bb or BB \u00d7 Bb. The correct answer depends on the options available. Looking at the options, both C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) are valid and produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question asks for the most likely combination, which could refer to any correct possibility.\n\nBut let me double-check the problem statement. It says, \"the most likely answer,\" suggesting a unique choice. However, both C and E would lead to a 3:1 ratio. Maybe I missed something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making the cross produce a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb, but that also produces a 3:1 ratio. So both C and E are correct. But in the options provided, both are included. However, the question is phrased as \"what was the most likely,\" implying a singular answer. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nLooking back at the options, both C and E are valid. However, in the options presented, the correct ones are C, E, and perhaps others depending on the parents' genotypes. But wait, let me re-examine each option.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 3:1.\n\nBoth are correct. But the question provides multiple-choice options, expecting one letter answer. Since both C and E are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C or E, but the user hasn't specified further constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that a 3:1 ratio occurs when the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one parent is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive (BB \u00d7 bb). But in this case, the parents are both black-coated. So, they could be:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb (produces 3:1)\n- BB \u00d7 Bb (produces 3:1)\n- bb \u00d7 bb (produces 1:1, incorrect)\n- BB \u00d7 BB (produces 1:0, incorrect)\n\nSo both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb are correct. However, in the options, both C and E are present. So perhaps the intended answer is C or E, but without more context, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are labeled A to J, with each representing a possible cross. The question is which option describes a cross that results in the observed 3:1 ratio. Both C and E are correct, but the user expects a single letter answer. However, upon reviewing, the user's initial instruction said to select the answer as a single letter, but didn't provide the options correctly. Wait, no, the user provided options A to J, each with various crosses, and asked to choose the correct one. However, in the problem statement, the user wants the assistant to select the answer from A to J, indicating which cross is correct.\n\nGiven that, both C and E are correct. However, in the options, only C and E are listed. But perhaps the intended answer is C because it's a standard cross in dihybrid problems. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's the cross of bb \u00d7 BB, which is similar to BB \u00d7 bb.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb produce the same 3:1 ratio. So, perhaps the correct answer is either C or E. However, since the options are distinct, perhaps the user expects us to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the options, only one of them is a standard cross that results in the 3:1 ratio. For example, in a dihybrid cross, if both parents are Bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option C. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is option E. Both are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer is C, as it's the more common example used in textbooks. Alternatively, E is also correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question allows multiple correct answers, but the system expects only one. However, the user instructions say to pick one letter. So, perhaps I should go with C, as it's the standard cross leading to a 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, actually the user presented the possible answers as letters A to J, but some of these seem to be pairs, while others might just be individual genotypes. Wait, perhaps I need to clarify whether the correct answer is a genotype (like option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is a cross), or an individual genotype (like option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is another cross). But looking back, the user wrote \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\" and then listed options like A. Bb \u00d7 Bb etc., so they're presenting all possible cross combinations as separate possibilities. Therefore, each option represents a possible pair of parents.\n\nSo, my task is to figure out which of these pairs when crossed will produce a \u00be black and \u00bc white offspring ratio. Alternatively, since all options represent different cross combinations, I can evaluate each one to see if their expected offspring ratios match the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nLet me recall that for a monohybrid cross where the dominant allele is B and the recessive is b, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant : recessive). However, here the phenotype is based on coat color, which is also determined by a single gene. So, the possible outcomes depend on the parents' genotypes.\n\nSince the parents are both guinea pigs, let's assume they're homozygous for the same alleles unless stated otherwise. Wait, but the parents aren't necessarily homozygous. The parents could be heterozygous (Bb) or homozygous recessive (bb).\n\nLooking at the observed ratio: \u00be black, \u00bc white. That's a 3:1 ratio, similar to a typical monohybrid cross. For a monohybrid cross with a Bb x Bb, the expected ratio is indeed 3:1. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, their offspring should have a 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if both parents are Bb, any cross among them would yield a 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but let me check if there are any exceptions. For example, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the expected ratio would be 2:1 (BB : Bb), not 3:1. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the ratio would be 1:1 (BB : bb). On the other hand, if both parents are bb, all offspring would be bb, resulting in a 100% white coat. That doesn't fit our scenario.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 ratio. This fits because crossing two heterozygotes gives a 3:1 outcome.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 Hmm, this seems to involve multiple crosses. Let me think: BB \u00d7 BB would give all Bb offspring? No, wait, BB \u00d7 BB would produce all BB offspring. Then Bb \u00d7 bb would produce a 1:1 ratio of Bb : bb, leading to 1/4 Bb and 1/4 bb. So combining these, you'd have 1/4 BB (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 1/4 Bb (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 1/4 Bb (from BB \u00d7 bb) plus 1/4 bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb). So the total would be 2/4 BB + 2/4 (Bb + bb) = 2/4 BB + 2/4 Bb (since bb is all white). Wait, that would make the phenotypic ratio 1:1 (BB and Bb are black, bb is white), which is 50-50 instead of 3:1. So option B's offspring wouldn't fit.\n\nBut wait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me redo the analysis. Option B lists two crosses: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. The first cross (BB \u00d7 BB) produces all BB. The second cross (Bb \u00d7 bb) produces a 3:1 ratio, which would be 3 parts Bb and 1 part bb. But wait, the second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce 25% Bb and 25% bb. So the combined offspring would be 100% of BB (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 25% Bb (from BB \u00d7 BB) plus 25% Bb (from BB \u00d7 bb) plus 25% bb (from Bb \u00d7 bb). So total BB: 25%, Bb: 50%, and bb: 25%. Thus, phenotypically, BB and Bb (black) and bb (white), giving a 3:1 ratio (75% black, 25% white). Wait, that's exactly the ratio observed! So why am I confused?\n\nWait, no, hold on. Let me clarify. When you perform multiple crosses, the offspring are all produced from those crosses. So for option B, the two parents are BB and Bb and bb? Or is it BB \u00d7 BB and then Bb \u00d7 bb? Actually, no. Option B says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\", which implies two separate crosses. The first cross is BB \u00d7 BB, which results in all BB. The second cross is Bb \u00d7 bb, which results in a 3:1 ratio of Bb : bb. Combining these, the total number of offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB \u00d7 BB: 100% BB (so 100% black).\nFrom Bb \u00d7 bb: 75% Bb (so 75% black) and 25% bb (so 25% white).\nTotal black: 100% + 75% = 175%?\nWait, no, percentages don't add beyond 100. So the actual proportion is: 100% of BB (which is 100%) plus 75% of Bb (so 75% more than the first cross) plus 25% of bb (so 25% more than the first cross). But this is impossible because you can't have more than 100% in reality. So perhaps I've misapplied it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the correct way to approach this is to consider that each cross produces its own set of offspring, and the overall population includes all of them. But that complicates things, and typically, when someone presents such a setup, it refers to a single cross involving multiple parents or a single cross with multiple parents involved, but that's usually represented differently.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me consider the options again.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 This is a cross between a homozygous recessive (bb) and a heterozygote (Bb). The expected ratio is 1:1 (B : b), so 75% B and 25% b. Phenotypically, B would be black, and b would be white. So the ratio would be 3:1 (75% black, 25% white). That matches our observed ratio. So why is option C being considered later?\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 All offspring would be bb, hence all white. Not matching.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 Cross between homozygous recessive (bb) and homozygous dominant (BB). Expected ratio is 1:1 (B : b), so 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). Again, 3:1 ratio. So this would also fit. So now I'm seeing options C, E, and possibly others.\n\nWait, going back to the original problem statement, the parents are crossed once, producing all their offspring. So if the parents are bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option C, the offspring would have a 1:1 ratio (B : b), thus 3:1 phenotypic ratio. Similarly, if the parents are bb \u00d7 BB (option E), the same applies. So both C and E would produce a 3:1 ratio. Now, looking at the options provided, both C and E are present as options.\n\nSimilarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would also result in a 1:1 ratio. So perhaps multiple options could lead to the desired ratio. However, the question asks which was the most likely, implying only one correct answer. So perhaps I need to look for a specific pattern in the parents' genotypes.\n\nAnother angle: the observed ratio is \u00be black, \u00bc white, which is a 3:1 ratio. The standard dihybrid cross yields a 9:3:3:1 ratio when considering two traits, but here it's a single trait. Wait, no, it's still a single trait, so the basic idea is that the parents must contribute alleles in a way that leads to a 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then their cross would produce 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), the ratio is 1:1. So, for a 3:1 ratio, both parents must be heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or perhaps one parent is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive.\n\nWait, but if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would produce a 2:2 ratio (B : b), leading to 75% B (black) and 25% b (white). So that's not a 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is bb, the cross would produce 25% B (from BB \u00d7 bb), but the other parents would produce 25% bb. So the ratio would be 25% B : 75% bb, which is 1:3, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Wait, no, that's 1:3, meaning 25% B (75%) and 25% bb (25%). Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, let me clarify. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), their cross would result in all offspring being B (since BB \u00d7 Bb would produce BB (from BB) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb)). So the phenotypic ratio would be 100% black, which is not the case here. So that's incorrect.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb, making the cross produce 3:1 (75% B, 25% b). Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb would not work because that would produce a 2:2 ratio, which is 75% B and 25% b, but wait, that's not the case. Because BB \u00d7 Bb would produce BB (from BB \u00d7 Bb) and Bb (from BB \u00d7 Bb). So the proportion would be 100% BB (100% B) and 50% Bb (50% B and 50% b). So total would be 150% B and 50% b, which isn't possible. So perhaps I'm missing something here.\n\nWait, no. The cross of BB \u00d7 Bb would produce four gametes: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and Bb (50%). Wait, no, wait. BB is 100% gamete B; Bb is 50% B and 50% b. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb:\nBB (from BB \u00d7 B)\nBb (from BB \u00d7 b)\nBb (from Bb \u00d7 B)\nBb (from Bb \u00d7 b)\n\nWait, no, that's incorrect. Each parent produces gametes. The father (BB) produces only B gametes. The mother (Bb) produces B (25%) and b (75%). So the Punnett square would be:\n\nFather: B\nMother: Bb\n\nPossible gametes:\nB (25%), b (75%)\n\nCrossing B \u00d7 Bb:\nEach gamete combines with each allele.\n- From B (25%): B \u00d7 B = BB (25%), B \u00d7 b = Bb (25%)\n- From b (75%): B \u00d7 b = Bb (75%); b \u00d7 b = bb (75%)\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\nBB (25%), Bb (25% + 75%) = 100%, and bb (75%).\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 75% B (BB and Bb) and 25% b (bb). Which is 3:1. So yes, that's correct. Therefore, if both parents are Bb, the cross produces a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 2:2, which is 75% B and 25% b, but that's not 3:1. Wait, no, wait\u2014when you cross BB (100% B) with Bb (50% B, 50% b), the resulting genotypes are:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb:\nAll offspring inherit B from the father and either B or b from the mother.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are BB (25%) and Bb (75%). So the phenotypic ratio is 75% B and 25% b, which is 3:1. Wait, that's interesting. Because the parents are BB and Bb, the cross would produce a 3:1 ratio. So both the cases where one parent is BB and the other is Bb, or both parents are Bb, would result in a 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut according to the initial problem statement, the parents are both guinea pigs with black coats. It doesn't specify whether they're homozygous or heterozygous. So, if they're both Bb, then the cross would give a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one is BB and the other is Bb, the same happens.\n\nWait, but earlier when I thought about the cross of BB \u00d7 Bb, I got a 75% B and 25% b ratio, which is 3:1. So both scenarios where the parents are Bb and Bb, or BB and Bb, would result in a 3:1 ratio. So both options C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) would produce a 3:1 ratio, along with option H (BB \u00d7 Bb).\n\nBut looking back at the options, the user presented all possible cross combinations, including each parent being homozygous or heterozygous. So, which of these options is correct?\n\nWait, the problem states that the parents are both guinea pigs, both with black coats. So, they could be either:\n\n1. Both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) \u2192 cross produces 3:1.\n2. One heterozygous (Bb) and one homozygous (BB) \u2192 cross produces 3:1.\n3. Both homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb) \u2192 cross produces 100% white, which is incorrect.\n4. Other possibilities may exist.\n\nHowever, the options given include both Bb \u00d7 Bb and bb \u00d7 Bb as valid options. But in reality, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. So, why are they presented separately?\n\nIn the context of the problem, the parents are both black-coated. They could be either Bb \u00d7 Bb or BB \u00d7 Bb. The correct answer depends on the options available. Looking at the options, both C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) are valid and produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question asks for the most likely combination, which could refer to any correct possibility.\n\nBut let me double-check the problem statement. It says, \"the most likely answer,\" suggesting a unique choice. However, both C and E would lead to a 3:1 ratio. Maybe I missed something else.\n\nWait, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making the cross produce a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, one parent is BB and the other is Bb, but that also produces a 3:1 ratio. So both C and E are correct. But in the options provided, both are included. However, the question is phrased as \"what was the most likely,\" implying a singular answer. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the notation.\n\nLooking back at the options, both C and E are valid. However, in the options presented, the correct ones are C, E, and perhaps others depending on the parents' genotypes. But wait, let me re-examine each option.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 3:1.\n\nBoth are correct. But the question provides multiple-choice options, expecting one letter answer. Since both C and E are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is C or E, but the user hasn't specified further constraints.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The key point is that a 3:1 ratio occurs when the parents are both heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one parent is homozygous dominant and the other homozygous recessive (BB \u00d7 bb). But in this case, the parents are both black-coated. So, they could be:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 Bb (produces 3:1)\n- BB \u00d7 Bb (produces 3:1)\n- bb \u00d7 bb (produces 1:1, incorrect)\n- BB \u00d7 BB (produces 1:0, incorrect)\n\nSo both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb are correct. However, in the options, both C and E are present. So perhaps the intended answer is C or E, but without more context, it's ambiguous.\n\nWait, looking back, the options are labeled A to J, with each representing a possible cross. The question is which option describes a cross that results in the observed 3:1 ratio. Both C and E are correct, but the user expects a single letter answer. However, upon reviewing, the user's initial instruction said to select the answer as a single letter, but didn't provide the options correctly. Wait, no, the user provided options A to J, each with various crosses, and asked to choose the correct one. However, in the problem statement, the user wants the assistant to select the answer from A to J, indicating which cross is correct.\n\nGiven that, both C and E are correct. However, in the options, only C and E are listed. But perhaps the intended answer is C because it's a standard cross in dihybrid problems. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is E because it's the cross of bb \u00d7 BB, which is similar to BB \u00d7 bb.\n\nWait, perhaps the confusion arises because both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb produce the same 3:1 ratio. So, perhaps the correct answer is either C or E. However, since the options are distinct, perhaps the user expects us to choose one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider that in the options, only one of them is a standard cross that results in the 3:1 ratio. For example, in a dihybrid cross, if both parents are Bb, the cross is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option C. Alternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is option E. Both are correct.\n\nBut perhaps the correct answer is C, as it's the more common example used in textbooks. Alternatively, E is also correct.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the question allows multiple correct answers, but the system expects only one. However, the user instructions say to pick one letter. So, perhaps I should go with C, as it's the standard cross leading to a 3:1 ratio.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Another possibility is if both parents are Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio as well. Wait, no\u2014that can't be right because I thought when both parents are Bb, you get 75% Bb (phenotype black) and 25% BB (phenotype black, since BB is the same as Bb in terms of phenotype if dominant). Oh wait, actually, in a monohybrid cross, all Bb individuals produce 50% B and 50% b gametes. When combined, 25% BB (which is B_), 50% Bb (B_), and 25% bb (b_).

Therefore, only option A gives a 3:1 ratio of black to white. So the correct answer is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, some of these are duplicated, like option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is similar to F and H, but perhaps they represent different scenarios. But since the question mentions \"genotypes of the parents were most likely,\" I think it refers to the possible pairs that could produce those offspring ratios.\n\nLet me recall that when you cross two Bb animals, each parent can give either B or b. So, the possible gametes are 50% B and 50% b. Using a Punnett square, the possible offspring would be:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, according to the problem, \u00be have black and \u00bc have white. That doesn't match exactly because here we'd have 25% BB and 25% bb, which adds up to 50%, not 75%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb and Bb, then as above, their offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Wait, but the problem states 75% black and 25% white, meaning that all the offspring must express the dominant trait. That would require that every offspring has at least one dominant allele. How does that happen?\n\nAh! If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then the possible offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But in this case, only the bb would express white, while the others would express black. So, the phenotypic ratio would be 75% black (from BB and Bb) and 25% white (from bb). That matches the problem statement perfectly. So, the parents must both be Bb. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would give an even distribution, not matching the ratio. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would always be homozygous recessive and thus white. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as G. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which gives 25% BB and 75% Bb. Wait, no\u2014let me recalculate that. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is bb (homozygous recessive), the Punnett square would show 100% BB and 0% Bb, so all offspring would be black. But the problem says 75% black and 25% white, so that's not possible. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as E and G; resulting in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Again, 75% black and 25% white. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can contribute B or b. So, the possible gametes are 50% B and 50% b. The Punnett square would be: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But again, only bb would express white, leading to 75% black and 25% white. So, both C and H seem correct? Or did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, another thought: When both parents are Bb, the F1 generation will have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Phenotypically, BB and Bb will be black, and bb will be white. So the ratio is 75% black : 25% white, which fits the problem. Now, looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to 25% BB and 75% Bb, so 100% black. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would give 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. So, 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in 75% black and 25% white. So why are both C and H correct? But the options don't allow multiple choices, so perhaps I'm missing something else.\n\nWait, but the parents are both Bb, making the F1 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Correct. So the parents' genotypes are both Bb. Looking at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which does fit. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also fits. However, the answer options include each pair once, so perhaps among the options provided, both C and H are possible. But in reality, any of the parents being Bb would work. So the correct answer should be that both parents are Bb. Checking the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which does fit. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also fits. But the way the options are presented, each pair is unique. Wait, perhaps the question is about the possible genotype pairs, and the parents could be any of the four possible combinations. So, looking for the pair that leads to the observed ratio.\n\nSo, the correct parents are both Bb, which corresponds to option G, but G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Wait, no. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would give 25% BB and 75% Bb, so all black. Not matching. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which gives 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would give 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Same as C. So both C and H are correct. But the options don't present both as separate; perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which would be option G. But wait, no, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Let me check again.\n\nWait, actually, the correct genotype for both parents would be Bb each. So, looking at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which does fit. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also fits. So, perhaps the correct answer is either C or H. But in the options, both C and H exist. Let me see the actual options again.\n\nThe options are:\n\nA.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nWait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is incorrect because it results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, the F1 would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Thus, all would be black except the bb ones. So, the ratio would be 75% black : 25% white. Therefore, option G would result in that ratio. But earlier, I thought that option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) both result in the same ratio. So, why is option G included?\n\nWait, perhaps I need to consider whether both parents could be Bb. So, if both parents are Bb, the F1 will be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Which gives 75% black and 25% white. So, the parents' genotypes are both Bb. Among the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which does fit. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also fits. So, both C and H are correct, but in the options, perhaps only one is listed. Wait, checking the original options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both are correct. So, the correct answer would be either C or H, but since the options don't allow selecting multiple answers, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are both Bb, which would correspond to option G. But no, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is that both parents are Bb, which would correspond to any of the options where both are Bb, such as option C, H, etc., but in the given options, only C and H are present. Wait, looking back, the user's question lists options A to J, including G as Bb \u00d7 BB and C as bb \u00d7 Bb. So, perhaps the correct answer is that the parents are both Bb, which is represented by option G, but that's incorrect because option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option A. No, because option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, so 75% black and 25% white. So, option A is correct, but option G is also correct. Wait, but in reality, when both parents are Bb, the F1 is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, the correct answer is that both parents are Bb, which is represented by option G. But in the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is incorrect. Therefore, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Maybe the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option A. Wait, no, because option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, giving 75% black and 25% white. So that's correct. Then why is option G also correct? Because option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would give 25% BB, 75% Bb, so all black. So, the correct answer depends on the parents. If the parents are both Bb, the answer is option G. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the answer is option A. But the question asks which pair was most likely the parents based on the offspring ratio. So, the correct parents are both Bb, which is option G. But wait, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. So, I'm confused now.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I've misunderstood the cross. Let me try calculating the expected ratios again. For example, if both parents are Bb, the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. The Punnett square would have:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nThus, 75% BB/Bb (black) and 25% bb (white).\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the gametes are B and B (50%) and B (50%). So, the F1 would be:\n\n- BB: 25% \n- Bb: 75% \n\nWhich means 25% BB (black) and 75% Bb (black), so all black. Hence, the ratio would be 100% black, not 75% black. So, option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) would not fit the observed data. Option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) would give 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white), hence 75% black and 25% white, which matches. Similarly, option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would give the same result. So, both C and H are correct. But since each option represents a specific pairing, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A. Wait, no, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. Alternatively, the question might be expecting that the parents are Bb and Bb, which would explain the 75% black phenotype. So, the correct answer is A. But wait, no, because option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A. But wait, in reality, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, so 75% black and 25% white. So, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me approach it differently. The phenotypic ratio is 3:1, which implies that 75% are black and 25% are white. This can occur if the F1 generation is homozygous recessive (bb) only. To get that, both parents must be Bb, so that all their offspring are BB, Bb, or bb. So, the parents' genotypes must be Bb each. Therefore, the correct answer is that the parents are both Bb, which would be option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) or option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) or option H (BB \u00d7 Bb). But in the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit, while C and H do. However, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A. Wait, no, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. So, the correct answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that if both parents are Bb, the F1 is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, the F1 would be 75% black and 25% white, matching the problem. Therefore, the parents' genotypes are Bb each, which is represented by option G. But option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. So, the correct answer is option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

But wait, no, because option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A. But wait, in reality, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb, so 75% black and 25% white. So, option A is correct.\n\nBut wait, I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Let me approach it differently. The phenotypic ratio is 3:1, which implies that 75% are black and 25% are white. This can occur if the F1 generation is homozygous recessive (bb) only. To get that, both parents must be Bb, so that all their offspring are BB, Bb, or bb. So, the parents' genotypes must be Bb each. Therefore, the correct answer is that the parents are both Bb, which would be option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) or option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) or option H (BB \u00d7 Bb). But in the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit, while C and H do. However, perhaps the intended answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A. Wait, no, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. So, the correct answer is that the parents are Bb and Bb, which is option A.\n\nWait, but earlier analysis shows that if both parents are Bb, the F1 is 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, the F1 would be 75% black and 25% white, matching the problem. Therefore, the parents' genotypes are Bb each, which is represented by option G. But option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't fit. So, perhaps the intended answer is option A, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. So, the correct answer is option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Let's think about the possible outcomes based on different parent pairs.\n\nBlack coat is dominant, so the alleles are B (dominant) and b (recessive). The parents must produce gametes that when combined give a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. That implies that the parents contribute either dominant or recessive alleles such that in all cases, at least one dominant allele is present in the offspring. Because if all gametes were recessive (like bb), then all offspring would be white. But here, some are black and some are white, meaning not all gametes are recessive.\n\nSo, the parents cannot be homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb = Bb \u00d7 Bb?), Wait no. If both parents are Bb, their gametes can produce B and b. So, the Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Then, the coat colors would be 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb). Which matches exactly the given data: \u00be black, \u00bc white.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the possible gametes are B and Bb \u2192 wait, no. The second parent is Bb, so gametes are B and b. Parent 1 is BB, so always gives B. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nParent 1 (BB): B  \nParent 2 (Bb): B and b  \nSo, offspring genotypes: BB (25%), Bb (50%). The coat colors would be 25% black (BB) and 75% brown (Bb), but the given problem states that black is dominant over white. Wait, in this case, if B is dominant, then Bb would still be black. But according to the problem statement, all offspring have black coat except one quarter, so this might not fit. Wait, perhaps I got that wrong. Let me clarify: if the parents are BB and Bb, then the offspring would be BB (from BB) and Bb (from Bb). So, all offspring would be black, but according to the problem, only \u00be are black, and \u00bc are white. Therefore, this pairing doesn't work.\n\nWait, another possibility: if one parent is BB (always B) and the other is Bb (Bb). Then, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. So, all would be black, which contradicts the problem where only \u00be are black. So, perhaps that's not correct.\n\nAnother thought: Maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. As I considered earlier, that would result in 75% black and 25% white. That fits perfectly with the given data.\n\nLet me check another possibility: Suppose one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Then, as above, the offspring would be BB (25%) and Bb (50%). So, 25% black and 75% brown, which doesn't match the problem's \u00be black.\n\nWhat about if one parent is BB and the other is bb? Then, all offspring would be Bb, which is black, so 100% black. Not matching.\n\nIf one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would be 50% Bb and 50% bb. So, 50% black, 50% white. But the problem says \u00be black and \u00bc white. Doesn't fit.\n\nWhat about if both parents are Bb? That would lead to 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 75% black, 25% white. That matches the data. So, parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb seems correct.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, does that make sense? No, because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, as discussed, the offspring would be 25% BB and 50% Bb. So, 75% black, 25% brown. Which doesn't match the required \u00be black. So, option G isn't correct.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. That means one parent is bb (homozygous recessive) and the other is BB (heterozygous). When they mate, the offspring will receive b from the bb parent and B from the BB parent, so all offspring will be Bb. Thus, all would be black, which contradicts the problem.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, hence all white. Doesn't match.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. One parent is bb and the other is Bb. When they mate, the offspring would get b from the bb parent and B from the Bb parent, so all offspring would be Bb. All black. Contradiction.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Same as C and E; offspring are Bb, all black.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Offspring would be Bb, all black. Contradiction.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. All offspring would be BB. All black. Contradiction.\n\nSo, the only option left is G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no\u2014wait, I just went through that and realized that if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring are 50% BB and 50% Bb. Which is 50% black, 50% brown. But our problem requires 75% black and 25% brown. So, that's not correct.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought that Bb \u00d7 Bb gave 75% black and 25% white. So why didn't any of the options include that?\n\nLooking back, the options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF.

But as I saw, that leads to all offspring being Bb, which is black, contradicting the required \u00be black.\n\nWait, am I missing something? Oh! Wait a minute. Perhaps I made a mistake in my initial analysis. Let me re-examine the problem.\n\nThe parents are crossing two guinea pigs, both with black coats. The ratio is \u00be black, \u00bc white. So, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1. Now, in dihybrid crosses, but this is a simple monohybrid cross.\n\nIn a simple monohybrid cross, the expected phenotypic ratio is determined by the genotype of the parents. For example, if parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the cross would yield 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So, 75% B (black) and 25% b (white).\n\nBut in this case, the parents are of a certain type, and the offspring ratio is given. So, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to 75% B and 25% b. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, and the answer is G.\n\nBut wait, looking at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB. But that wouldn't explain the 3:1 ratio. Unless the parents are of different types.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm getting confused. Let me try to approach this differently. The possible genotypes of each parent that could produce an observed 3:1 ratio.\n\nFor a simple dominant-recessive relationship, the parents would need to produce gametes that allow 75% of the offspring to express the dominant trait and 25% to express the recessive. This can happen only if the parents are heterozygous and heterozygous (i.e., Bb \u00d7 Bb), because their gametes are B and b. So, the Punnett square would be:\n\nParent 1: Bb  \nParent 2: Bb  \nPossible gametes: B and b  \nCross: B + B \u2192 BB (25%), B + b \u2192 Bb (50%), b + b \u2192 bb (25%).\n\nPhenotype ratio: BB (black), Bb (black), bb (white) \u2192 75% black, 25% white. This matches the given data.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, that's option G.\n\nBut wait, the options also include other pairs like Bb \u00d7 Bb and others, so I need to see if any other combination could also produce a 3:1 ratio.\n\nFor instance, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, as I mentioned earlier, the offspring would be 25% BB and 50% Bb, resulting in 75% black and 25% brown. But in the problem, it's stated that one quarter have white coats, so that's correct. However, the initial assumption was that the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, but perhaps there's another way.\n\nWait, another scenario: If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. So, 25% black, 75% brown. But the problem states that \u00be are black, which doesn't align with this.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring would be Bb, hence all black. That doesn't fit the data.\n\nThus, the only viable option is Bb \u00d7 Bb, making the correct answer G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

But perhaps they meant that each option represents possible combinations for each parent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that the parents are either two Bb (option G) or something else, like F being Bb \u00d7 bb. But regardless, I need to figure out which genotype pair results in the observed ratio.\n\nFirst, let's consider that the phenotype ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white. This suggests that the offspring exhibit a 3:1 ratio, which can happen in several ways depending on the parents' genotypes. One common way is when both parents are heterozygous for the trait (like Bb \u00d7 Bb), leading to a 25% chance of each possible genotype in the offspring. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce four possible gametes: B, b, B, b. When combined, the Punnett square shows 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Then, the phenotypes would be 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb).\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Crossing them would result in a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, same as above. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't change anything; the phenotypic ratio remains the same. Another case where the parents are both Bb, leading to the same outcome.\n\nBut wait, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the offspring would be:\n\n- From BB: all Bb offspring.\n- From Bb: half BB, half Bb.\n\nSo, the total would still be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb.

Looking back at the options, E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" which would lead to the same outcome. So, options C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) are possibilities. But let's check other options too.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would always produce bb offspring, meaning all white coats, which doesn't match the observation. Similarly, H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would give the same as E. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, same as E. So, both E and G would result in the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but the question is asking which combination of parents was most likely. Both E and G seem correct based on this analysis. But let me think again\u2014if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, the offspring would also show a 3:1 ratio. So, options A and G are both correct. But since the options are separate letters, perhaps there's an error in my reasoning. Alternatively, maybe I missed something.\n\nAnother angle: If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, their offspring will have a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. That gives the right ratio. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the same thing happens\u2014because BB can't pass on any recessive alleles. So, the parents must both be heterozygotes (Bb) or one is Bb and the other is bb. Wait, no\u2014the only way to get the 3:1 ratio is if the parents are Bb and Bb, or BB and Bb. Because if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB: all B (so all B)\nFrom Bb: 50% B and 50% b\n\nThus, the total would be 100% B + 50% B and 50% b = 75% B and 25% b, which matches the ratio. Wait, no\u2014it's not exactly that. The correct calculation is: when you cross BB (which produces only B gametes) with Bb (producing B and b gametes equally), the offspring would be:\n\n- BB (from Bx B) \n- Bb (from Bx b)\n\nWhich gives 50% BB and 50% Bb. So, the phenotypes would be 75% B (since BB and Bb are both B) and 25% bb. So, that works as well. Thus, the parents could be BB and Bb, or Bb and Bb.\n\nLooking at the options, E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" and G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\". These are both valid cases. So, why are these both present in the answer choices? Maybe I should check the exact wording of the question again. It says, \"The genotypes of the parents were most likely...\" So, perhaps both E and G are correct, but among the options, only one is listed. Wait, checking the original options, option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\", and option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\". Are both of these possible?\n\nYes, because crossing Bb (heterozygous) with BB (homozygous dominant) would result in 75% B and 25% b, as explained earlier. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 Bb would also result in the same. So, both E and G are correct. But in the provided options, they are presented separately. So, perhaps the correct answer includes both E and G, but since the user expects a single letter, I need to see if any of the options fit both. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the initial assumption.\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual possible combinations for the parents that result in the 3:1 ratio are:\n\n- Both parents are Bb (E and G)\n- One parent is BB and the other is Bb (but that's not listed as an option except E and G?)\n\nWait, let me re-examine the options:\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nThese are both correct. Now, looking at the other options:\n\n- A. Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 leads to 3:1 (correct)\n- B. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 this seems complicated; probably not relevant here\n- C. bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as E\n- D. bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 all white (doesn't match)\n- F. Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as E\n- H. BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 same as E\n- I. BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as E\n- J. BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 same as A\n\nSo, options C, F, H, I, J all involve either BB or Bb paired with bb. Those pairs would result in all white offspring (if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be 25% B and 75% b?), wait no: If you have Bb \u00d7 bb, the offspring would be 50% B and 50% b, resulting in 25% BB (which would be black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So, that would be 75% black and 25% white. Which matches the observed ratio. So, Bb \u00d7 bb would also work, making F and J correct in addition to E and G. But according to the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb, and J is BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nWait, hold on. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would be:\n\n- 25% B (phenotype black)\n- 50% Bb (phenotype black)\n- 25% bb (phenotype white)\n\nSo, 75% black and 25% white, which fits the observed ratio. So, F and J would also be correct, but the options don't include all of them. So, now I'm confused because there are multiple correct answers, but the options require selecting a single letter. Perhaps the intended answer is E or G, but considering that both E and G are correct, but maybe the question assumes that the parents are both heterozygous, hence E and G, but the options may not have duplicates.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the correct answer is E, as it's more straightforward, but without further information, it's hard to say. Wait, let me double-check the original question. The question asks for the most likely genotype pair, so both E and G would be correct, but in the options, they are separate. So, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'll proceed to provide the answer accordingly.\n\nWait, but looking back, the user wants the final answer in a single letter. So, perhaps the correct answer is E, but considering that Bb \u00d7 Bb also leads to the same ratio, maybe both E and G are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is E. Alternatively, maybe I've misapplied the principles.\n\nWait, another approach: using Punnett squares. For a 3:1 ratio, the parents must produce a 3/4 chance of producing a dominant allele and 1/4 of recessive. So, the parents must each contribute a dominant allele to produce the 3/4 chance. So, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, they can each produce gametes B and b, giving 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotype-wise, 75% B, 25% b. So, parents Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nFrom BB: all B (so 100% B)\nFrom Bb: 50% B and 50% b\n\nTotal offspring: 75% B, 25% b.\n\nSo, that also leads to a 3:1 ratio.\n\nTherefore, both E (Bb \u00d7 BB) and G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) are correct. But looking at the options, both E and G are present as separate options. So, the question is whether the parents are both heterozygous (E) or one is homozygous dominant and the other heterozygous (G). Without additional context, both scenarios are possible. However, the question asks for the most likely genotype pair. Since Bb \u00d7 Bb definitely leads to 3:1, and Bb \u00d7 BB also does, perhaps the intended answer is E, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but the options are separate, so perhaps the answer is E, but in reality, both E and G are correct. However, looking back at the options, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" while option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB.\" So, both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is E. Alternatively, maybe I should choose E because it's simpler. But honestly, I'm a bit stuck here. I'll go with E because it's a standard case where both parents are heterozygous, leading to a 3:1 ratio. But I'm not entirely confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option A, but I think that's less likely because the parents are stated to carry different coat colors. No, wait, the parents don't necessarily have to be different unless the question implies that. But in the absence of that information, both Bb \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 BB are possible. However, the options don't allow selecting two letters, so perhaps the intended answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nOptions:\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might be incorrect because when you cross two animals, you usually have two parents, not multiple pairs. But perhaps they meant that each option represents possible combinations for each parent. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe the question is saying that the parents are either two Bb (option G) or something else, like F being Bb \u00d7 bb. But regardless, I need to figure out which genotype pair results in the observed ratio.\n\nFirst, let's consider that the phenotype ratio is \u00be black : \u00bc white. This suggests that the offspring exhibit a 3:1 ratio, which can happen in several ways depending on the parents' genotypes. One common way is when both parents are heterozygous for the trait (like Bb \u00d7 Bb), leading to a 25% chance of each possible genotype in the offspring. For example, Bb \u00d7 Bb would produce four possible gametes: B, b, B, b. When combined, the Punnett square shows 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Then, the phenotypes would be 75% black (BB and Bb) and 25% white (bb).\n\nAlternatively, another possibility is that one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). Crossing them would result in a 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb, same as above. Wait, no\u2014that doesn't change anything; the phenotypic ratio remains the same. Another case where the parents are both Bb, leading to the same outcome.\n\nBut wait, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the offspring would be:\n\n- From BB: all Bb offspring.\n- From Bb: half BB, half Bb.\n\nSo, the total would still be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Therefore, the phenotypic ratio is \u00be black to \u00bc white, matching the observed data. However, in this case, the parents are BB and Bb. Looking back at the options, E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\" which would lead to the same outcome. So, options C (bb \u00d7 Bb) and E (bb \u00d7 BB) are possibilities. But let's check other options too.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would always produce bb offspring, meaning all white coats, which doesn't match the observation.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, actually, option F is written as \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" but then G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" etc. Maybe there was a typo, but I'll proceed with the understanding that each option represents different parent pairs.\n\nSince the offspring show a 3:1 ratio favoring black, this implies that the parents must produce gametes that are \u00be dominant and \u00bc recessive. That suggests that each parent is heterozygous for the coat color gene because when they cross, the possible gametes are equal parts dominant and recessive alleles. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, each can produce a 50% B and 50% b allele. When they combine, the Punnett square shows 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. The BB and Bb individuals express black (since B is dominant), while the bb expresses white. So, in this case, the 3:1 ratio comes from 25% + 50% = 75% being black and 25% being white. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, that's option G: G. Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, wait\u2014option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, right?\n\nBut hold on, another possibility is that one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), leading to a 1:1 ratio for Bb and bb. But here, the offspring ratio is 3:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 75% B and 25% b, which would lead to 75% BB (black) and 25% bb (white). That matches the given data perfectly. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, checking the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB.\n- Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n- Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, the correct answer should be where both parents are heterozygous (Bb), making their F1 generation 75% B and 25% b. Thus, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. That corresponds to option G, which is \"Bb \u00d7 BB.\" Wait, no\u2014the option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which is different from \"Bb \u00d7 Bb.\" Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the cross would yield a 3:1 ratio (75% B and 25% b). If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the offspring would be 50% B (from BB) and 50% Bb (from Bb). So the phenotypic ratio would still be 3:1 (75% B and 25% bb), same as before. So whether the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 BB, the offspring would have the same ratio. However, the way the parents are described might affect the genotype ratios.\n\nWait, but the options don't include a choice where both parents are Bb; instead, I see option G as \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which seems to match the reasoning above. Alternatively, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" which also leads to a 3:1 ratio. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me think again. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the F1 generation would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Both have the dominant phenotype, so the ratio would be 100% black, which doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Therefore, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, the F1 would be 75% B and 25% b. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be 50% B and 50% b, giving a 50% black and 50% white ratio. So that wouldn't fit our observed 3:1.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb. So among the options, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which would lead to 75% B and 25% b, matching the observed ratio. But wait, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" which also results in a 75% B and 25% b.

So they represent the same genotype pair. Therefore, regardless of the order, the parents are both Bb. So the correct answer is that both parents are Bb, which is option G or H. But since the options list G and H separately, and the user asks for a single-letter answer, probably the first occurrence. But in reality, G and H are the same pair, just swapped. So the correct genotype is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is represented in both G and H. So the answer is either G or H, but since the options are separate, perhaps the intended answer is G or H, but in any case, both correspond correctly.\n\nWait, but the initial question says, \"The genotypes of the parents were most likely...\" So if both parents are Bb, then the genotype pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb. But in the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is different. Wait, no\u2014if the parents are Bb and BB, the possible F1 would be 50% B and 50% Bb, giving a 50% black and 50% white. So that doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the parents must both be Bb, which makes the F1 75% B and 25% b. So the correct genotype pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G. Even though option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in the same F1, the genotype pair is still Bb \u00d7 BB, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014it depends on the parents. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 would be 50% B and 50% Bb, leading to a 50% black and 50% white ratio. Which doesn't fit. Therefore, the only way to get the desired ratio is for both parents to contribute 75% B and 25% b. So the correct genotype pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G. Even though option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, the parents' genotypes are still Bb and BB. Wait, no\u2014that's not accurate. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, meaning one parent is BB and the other is Bb. So the F1 would be 50% B and 50% Bb, which gives a 50% black and 50% white. So that doesn't fit. Therefore, the correct genotype pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, actually, option F is written as \"Bb \u00d7 bb\" but then G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" etc. Maybe there was a typo, but I'll proceed with the understanding that each option represents different parent pairs.\n\nSince the offspring show a 3:1 ratio favoring black, this implies that the parents must produce gametes that are \u00be dominant and \u00bc recessive. That suggests that each parent is heterozygous for the coat color gene because when they cross, the possible gametes are equal parts dominant and recessive alleles. For example, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, each can produce a 50% B and 50% b allele. When they combine, the Punnett square shows 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. The BB and Bb individuals express black (since B is dominant), while the bb expresses white. So, in this case, the 3:1 ratio comes from 25% + 50% = 75% being black and 25% being white. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, that's option G: G. Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no, wait\u2014option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, right?\n\nBut hold on, another possibility is that one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), leading to a 1:1 ratio for Bb and bb. But here, the offspring ratio is 3:1, not 1:1. So that doesn't fit. Alternatively, maybe the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 75% B and 25% b, which would lead to 75% BB (black) and 25% bb (white). That matches the given data perfectly. So the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Now, checking the options:\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB.\n- Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb.\n- Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nSo, based on my analysis, the correct answer should be where both parents are heterozygous (Bb), making their F1 generation 75% B and 25% b. Thus, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb. That corresponds to option G, which is \"Bb \u00d7 BB.\" Wait, no\u2014the option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which is different from \"Bb \u00d7 Bb.\" Hmm, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check.\n\nIf both parents are Bb, then the cross would yield a 3:1 ratio (75% B and 25% b). If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the offspring would be 50% B (from BB) and 50% Bb (from Bb). So the phenotypic ratio would still be 3:1 (75% B and 25% bb), same as before. So whether the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb or Bb \u00d7 BB, the offspring would have the same ratio. However, the way the parents are described might affect the genotype ratios.\n\nWait, but the options don't include a choice where both parents are Bb; instead, I see option G as \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which seems to match the reasoning above. Alternatively, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" which also leads to a 3:1 ratio. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me think again. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), the F1 generation would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Both have the dominant phenotype, so the ratio would be 100% black, which doesn't fit the 3:1 ratio. Therefore, that's incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, the F1 would be 75% B and 25% b. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 would be 50% B and 50% b, giving a 50% black and 50% white ratio. So that wouldn't fit our observed 3:1.\n\nTherefore, the only way to get a 3:1 ratio is if both parents are Bb. So among the options, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB,\" which would lead to 75% B and 25% b, matching the observed ratio. But wait, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb,\" which also results in a 75% B and 25% b. So why is option G present? Did I misread the options?\n\nLooking back, the user listed the options as A to J, but some are duplicates. Let me check:\n\nOptions:\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, the first thing I need to figure out is what genotype combination will produce a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. Let me think about possible cross combinations.\n\nFirstly, if both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), then the Punnett square would be:\n\n- BB x BB \u2192 BB (but since they're both Bb, perhaps I should consider all possible gametes)\nWait no, both parents are Bb. So each can produce B or b alleles. When you cross Bb \u00d7 Bb, the possible offspring genotypes are BB, Bb, and bb. The phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). That gives a 3:1 ratio (25+50=75 black, 25 white). But wait, the problem states three-quarters black, which matches exactly. So, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, their offspring would have a 75% black coat, which fits the given data.\n\nBut let me check the other options just to make sure there isn't another possibility.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see what that would produce. Each parent can give either B or b. So the offspring would have:\n\nBB (if B from each parent),\nBb (if B from one and b from the other),\nand bb (if b from each).\n\nThe phenotypic ratio would be 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Again, a 3:1 ratio. So this also results in three-quarters black and one-quarter white. Hmm, so both A and F seem to fit. Wait, but the question is about the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely.\" So if both parents are Bb, that's option G; if one is Bb and the other is bb, that's option F. Both scenarios lead to the same phenotype ratio, so why would any option suggest one over the other?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake. Let me double-check the ratios. For Bb \u00d7 Bb, as I thought before, the possible offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So that's 3/4 black and 1/4 white. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 bb produces the same because the other parent only contributes one allele\u2014so each offspring would get B from the Bb parent and b from the bb parent, giving Bb (which is black), or b from both, giving bb (white). So yes, both A (Bb\u00d7Bb) and F (Bb\u00d7bb) would result in the observed ratio. Therefore, both options G and F would work. However, the way the question is phrased asks for the \"most likely\" genotype of the parents, implying a specific answer. Maybe I overlooked something else.\n\nLooking back at the options, G is Bb\u00d7Bb, while F is Bb\u00d7bb. Are there any other possibilities? Option C is bb\u00d7Bb, which is similar to F but reversed. So both F and C would produce the same outcome. So why are two options possible when the question expects a single correct choice? Perhaps I need to consider whether the parents must carry the recessive allele. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would always receive B from the Bb parent and b from the bb parent, making all the offspring Bb (black), which contradicts the observation that some have white coats. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would always have Bb, hence black. So that wouldn't explain the presence of white-coated animals, meaning that if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the offspring would all be Bb, leading to 100% black. So that's not matching the given data. Therefore, F and C cannot both be correct because they don't allow for white-coated offspring. Hence, only G (Bb\u00d7Bb) and F (Bb\u00d7bb) correctly produce the observed ratio without forcing all offspring to be black. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that F might also produce a 3:1 ratio. Let me recheck. In a Bb\u00d7bb cross, each parent can contribute B or b. The Bb parent can produce 50% B and 50% b, and the bb parent can only produce b. So the offspring would be Bb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). So the phenotypes would be black (Bb) and white (bb). Thus, 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the problem's description of 3:1. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh, wait! No, because Bb is the Bb parent, which can produce both B and b alleles. So when crossed with bb (which only produces b), the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\n- From bb: b (100%)\n\nThus, combining:\n\nParent 1 (Bb): B or b\n\nParent 2 (bb): b\n\nSo offspring inherit:\n\nFrom Parent 1: B or b\n\nFrom Parent 2: b\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nBb (from B and b)\n\nbb (from b and b)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are black (for Bb) and white (for bb). Therefore, the ratio is 50% black and 50% white, which does not match the given data of 75% black and 25% white. So that means that F (Bb\u00d7bb) leads to a 50-50 split, which is incorrect according to the problem. Therefore, the correct parents must be both Bb (option G) or both Bb and Bb (since F would actually produce a different ratio). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. If both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square is:\n\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nPhenotype: BB = black, Bb = black, bb = white. So ratio is 75% black, 25% white, which matches the problem. So option G (Bb\u00d7Bb) is correct.\n\nNow, let's go back to option F. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nFrom Bb: B or b\n\nFrom bb: b\n\nSo the offspring would be:\n\nBB (not possible, since bb can't contribute an extra B), wait no\u2014the bb parent can only pass a b. So the offspring would be:\n\nIf Bb passes B and bb passes b \u2192 Bb\n\nOr Bb passes b and bb passes b \u2192 bb\n\nTherefore, the possible offspring are Bb (black) and bb (white). So 50% black, 50% white. Which doesn't fit the 75-25 ratio. Therefore, F is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's analyze H:\n\nParents: BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nCrossing BB (B from both parents) with Bb (B and b):\n\nOffspring will receive B from BB parent, and either B or b from Bb parent.\n\nSo possible genotypes:\n\nBB (from B and B) \u2192 black\n\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\n\nTherefore, all offspring are black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit the data. So H is wrong.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic:\n\nbb (can only pass b) \u00d7 BB (can pass B)\n\nAll offspring will be Bb \u2192 black. So 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb \u2192 white. 100% white. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. So:\n\nBB (passes B) \u00d7 bb (passes b)\n\nAll offspring will be Bb \u2192 black. 100% black. Incorrect.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both homozygous dominant, all offspring will be BB \u2192 black. Incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct options are G (Bb\u00d7Bb) and possibly others like F if it produced 75-25, but F actually produces 50-50. Therefore, the correct answer must be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Hence, only G (Bb\u00d7Bb) and F (Bb\u00d7bb) correctly produce the observed ratio without forcing all offspring to be black. \n\nWait, but earlier I thought that F might also produce a 3:1 ratio. Let me recheck. In a Bb\u00d7bb cross, each parent can contribute B or b. The Bb parent can produce 50% B and 50% b, and the bb parent can only produce b. So the offspring would be Bb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). So the phenotypes would be black (Bb) and white (bb). Thus, 50% black and 50% white, which doesn't match the problem's description of 3:1. Wait, that's conflicting with my previous conclusion. Did I make a mistake here?\n\nOh, wait! No, because Bb is the Bb parent, which can produce both B and b alleles. So when crossed with bb (which only produces b), the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\n- From bb: b (100%)\n\nThus, combining:\n\nParent 1 (Bb): B or b\n\nParent 2 (bb): b\n\nSo offspring inherit:\n\nFrom Parent 1: B or b\n\nFrom Parent 2: b\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\nBb (from B and b)\n\nbb (from b and b)\n\nThus, the phenotypes are black (for Bb) and white (for bb). Therefore, the ratio is 50% black and 50% white, which does not match the given data of 75% black and 25% white. So that means that F (Bb\u00d7bb) leads to a 50-50 split, which is incorrect according to the problem. Therefore, the correct parents must be both Bb (option G) or both Bb and Bb (since F would actually produce a different ratio). Wait, no, let me clarify.\n\nWait, no. Hold on. If both parents are Bb, then the Punnett square is:\n\nBb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nPhenotype: BB = black, Bb = black, bb = white. So ratio is 75% black, 25% white, which matches the problem. So option G (Bb\u00d7Bb) is correct.\n\nNow, let's go back to option F. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would be:\n\nFrom Bb: B or b\n\nFrom bb: b\n\nSo the offspring would be:\n\nBB (not possible, since bb can't contribute an extra B), wait no\u2014the bb parent can only pass a b. So the offspring would be:\n\nIf Bb passes B and bb passes b \u2192 Bb\n\nOr Bb passes b and bb passes b \u2192 bb\n\nTherefore, the possible offspring are Bb (black) and bb (white). So 50% black, 50% white. Which doesn't fit the 75-25 ratio. Therefore, F is incorrect.\n\nSimilarly, H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's analyze H:\n\nParents: BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous).\n\nCrossing BB (B from both parents) with Bb (B and b):\n\nOffspring will receive B from BB parent, and either B or b from Bb parent.\n\nSo possible genotypes:\n\nBB (from B and B) \u2192 black\n\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\n\nTherefore, all offspring are black. So 100% black, which doesn't fit the data. So H is wrong.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic:\n\nbb (can only pass b) \u00d7 BB (can pass B)\n\nAll offspring will be Bb \u2192 black. So 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb \u2192 white. 100% white. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. So:\n\nBB (passes B) \u00d7 bb (passes b)\n\nAll offspring will be Bb \u2192 black. 100% black. Incorrect.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both homozygous dominant, all offspring will be BB \u2192 black. Incorrect.\n\nSo the only correct options are G (Bb\u00d7Bb) and possibly others like F if it produced 75-25, but F actually produces 50-50. Therefore, the correct answer must be G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Anyway, let's think about possible parent genotypes.\n\nThe key point here is that the F1 generation shows a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio. That implies that each offspring must have at least one dominant allele (B), as the recessive condition (bb) results in white. So, the parents must produce gametes that include at least a dominant allele. Wait no, actually, since the parents are both crossing, their genotypes determine the possible gametes. If both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each will produce a 50% B and 50% b allele. When they combine, the possible genotypes for the offspring are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). But wait, when you consider actual phenotype outcomes based on dominance, if B is dominant over b, then:\n\n- BB \u2192 black\n- Bb \u2192 black\n- bb \u2192 white\n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 black : 1/4 white, which matches the problem statement. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Hmm, wait, no\u2014let me check. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Oh wait, no, actually, in the options provided, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\", which would lead to the same outcome as Bb \u00d7 Bb, right?\n\nLet me double-check. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the possible gametes are B and Bb. Wait, no\u2014the correct approach is to calculate the possible gamete types. For BB, the gametes are all B. For Bb, the gametes are 50% B and 50% b. So, when combining:\n\nParent 1: BB \u2192 gametes: B (100%)\nParent 2: Bb \u2192 gametes: B (50%) and b (50%)\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes:\nBB (from B and B): 100% (since Parent 1 always gives B)\nBb (from B and b): 50%\nbb (from b and b): 50%\n\nPhenotype-wise:\nBB \u2192 black\nBb \u2192 black\nbb \u2192 white\n\nThus, the ratio is 3:1 (black:white), which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Now, looking back at the options, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\" and option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". Both should produce the same genotype distribution. However, the parents' order doesn't matter because the parents are crossed regardless of which comes first. So whether it's Bb \u00d7 BB or BB \u00d7 Bb, the resulting phenotypic ratio remains 3:1.\n\nNow, let's see the other options just to be thorough. Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\". If one parent is homozygous recessive (bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), then the possible gametes are b (from bb) and B (from Bb). Combining:\n\n- bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 all bb (white)\n- bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 50% Bb and 50% bb\nBut wait, more accurately, the Punnett square would show:\n\nParent 1: bb (always)\nParent 2: Bb (gametes: B and b)\n\nSo the offspring would be:\n\nBb (50%) and bb (50%)\n\nPhenotype-wise:\nBb \u2192 black\nbb \u2192 white\n\nSo the ratio is 1:1, which doesn't match the problem's 3:1.

This clearly doesn't fit the problem's 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\". Similar reasoning as C, but reversed. One parent is bb (always bb), the other is BB (always BB). All offspring would be bb and BB, which phenotypically are black and white. Ratio is 1:1, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption F is \"Bb \u00d7 bb\". As above, same as C. Parents are Bb and bb. Offspring are Bb and bb (phenotype black and white). Ratio 1:1.\n\nOption I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\". As above, same as C. Offspring are Bb and bb (black and white).

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might not be valid because they mention multiple parents crossing. Let me clarify: Each option seems to represent different scenarios, possibly involving two parents. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would be a dihybrid cross between a Bb and a bb. But wait, since both parents can only contribute one allele for the coat color gene, perhaps the correct way to think about this is as a monohybrid cross.\n\nGiven that both parents have black coats, their possible genotypes must have at least one dominant allele (B). So, possible genotypes for each parent include BB or Bb. Now, when you make a cross between two parents, each parent can pass on either allele(s). Since there's only one gene involved here, each parent will pass either B or b. \n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce a 50% chance of passing B and a 50% chance of passing b. When you cross two heterozygotes, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The phenotypic ratio would then be 3:1\u20143 individuals with BB or Bb (black) and 1 individual with bb (white). That matches exactly with the given data where \u00be are black and \u00bc are white. So, if both parents are Bb, the offspring would have the expected ratio. Let's check the other options quickly to ensure this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. If both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning all would have white coats. This doesn't match the given data.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would get a b allele from the bb parent and an B from the BB parent, making them Bb. Again, all would have black coats, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Here, the BB parent will always give B, while the Bb parent has a 50% chance of giving B or b. So the offspring would have a 75% chance of being BB (all black) and 25% chance of being Bb (also all black, same phenotype). Wait no, actually, if one parent gives B and the other gives B or b, the offspring could be BB (if Bb gives B) or Bb (if Bb gives b). So the phenotypic ratio would still be \u00be black and \u00bc white, just like in option F. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Wait, no, if the parents are Bb and BB, the possible offspring genotypes would be Bb (from Bb parent giving B and BB parent giving B) and B (from Bb parent giving b and BB parent giving B). So the phenotypic ratio would be \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc B (white), which is the same as \u00be black and \u00bc white. So this also fits. So why is this listed separately?\n\nBut wait, the question is about the genotypes of the parents. So, if the parents are Bb and BB, their genotypes are Bb and BB, respectively. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb and bb, their genotypes are Bb and bb, resulting in all offspring being Bb (black), which doesn't fit. So going back, if both parents are Bb, their genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white), which is exactly the case here. So option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 BB. So both are correct, but since the question asks for the most likely, and both H and F are similar, but in reality, both options lead to the same outcome. However, looking back at the options provided, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, the options given are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, the first part says \"the most likely\", implying a single correct answer. From the analysis, if the parents are both Bb (option H), the offspring will be \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white). Another possibility is if one parent is Bb and the other is bb (option F), then all offspring will be Bb (black), which doesn't fit the data. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb (option C), the offspring would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%), so \u00be Bb (black), matching the data. Wait, that's another possibility. So both option C (BB \u00d7 Bb) and option H (Bb \u00d7 BB) would result in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. However, the question is about the genotype of the parents, not the offspring. So, if the parents are BB and Bb, their genotypes are BB and Bb. Or if the parents are Bb and BB, it's the same thing\u2014it's the same genotype pair, just swapped. So both C and H would be correct, but the question lists them as separate options. However, looking at the options, C is BB \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 BB. So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is H, but I need to see if any other options fit better.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents would produce gametes: Bb produces B and b; bb produces b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (from Bb \u00d7 b) and bb (from bb \u00d7 b). Thus, 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white), which matches the data. So option F would work too. So now I'm confused because both options C and F seem to fit. But looking back, the question specifies \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\". So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, their genotypes are Bb and bb. Alternatively, if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, their genotypes are BB and Bb. Are these considered different scenarios? No, because the order doesn't matter\u2014they're just two different parents. So whether the parents are Bb and bb or BB and Bb, the genotype pairs are the same in terms of composition. Therefore, both C and F are correct, but in the options provided, perhaps only one of them is presented. Looking back, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, matching the data. Option C is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. So both C and F are correct, but in the options, C and F are separate. But the question asks for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\" \u2014 which would imply a specific pairing. However, without more information, both C and F are correct. But in the options given, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, looking at the options, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would result in the correct ratio. Option C is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also works. So both are correct. However, perhaps the intended answer is H (BB \u00d7 Bb) because it's written as BB \u00d7 Bb, whereas option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. But both are equally correct. Maybe I should double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me verify the Punnett square for option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. The Bb parent can produce B or b, and the bb parent can only produce b. So the offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 b = Bb (produced by Bb \u00d7 b)\n- bb \u00d7 b = bb (produced by bb \u00d7 b)\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are Bb and bb, with probabilities \u00be and \u00bc respectively. Phenotypically, Bb would be black, and bb would be white, which matches the given data. Similarly, for option C: BB \u00d7 Bb. The BB parent can only produce B, and the Bb parent can produce B or b. So:\n\n- B (from BB) \u00d7 B = BB (all black)\n- B (from BB) \u00d7 b = Bb (all black)\n\nThus, 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black), which also fits the data. So both F and C are correct. However, in the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb and C is BB \u00d7 Bb. So which one is the correct answer? The question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents, so both options are correct, but perhaps only one is presented as an option. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I think both C and F are correct. However, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, which refers to the combination of their alleles. So both H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and F (Bb \u00d7 bb) are correct. However, the options don't have both together; instead, C and F are separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but in the context of the question, perhaps only one is meant. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not certain. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I think both C and F are correct. However, in the options, perhaps only one is presented. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H because it's more typical to have one dominant and one recessive allele, but both C and F are correct.\n\nWait, no\u2014the key point is that the parents' genotypes determine the offspring's ratios. Both H and F produce the correct ratio. However, the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. So if the parents are both Bb (H), that's a common case, whereas Bb and bb (F) is also possible. But perhaps the intended answer is H because it's more straightforward, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it involves a mix of B and b, which could lead to the observed ratio. But I think both C and F are correct, but in the options provided, perhaps only F is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H. Wait, I'm getting confused. Let me try to think differently.\n\nThe problem states that the parents are both guinea pigs with black coats. Black is dominant, white is recessive. The offspring are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is about the most likely genotype of the parents. As established, both BB \u00d7 Bb and Bb \u00d7 bb produce the correct ratio. However, among the options, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would indeed produce the required ratio, as well as option C is BB \u00d7 Bb. So both C and F are correct answers, but since the question asks for a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F, as it includes a mixture of alleles, whereas H is a homozygous case. However, I think both C and F are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is H, but I'm not confident. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F because it includes a mix of B and b alleles, whereas H is a pure Bb genotype.\n\nWait, no\u2014both C and F produce the correct ratio. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but since the options are presented separately, perhaps only one is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I think both C and F are correct. However, in the context of the question, perhaps the intended answer is H. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is F. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is H because it's a standard case.\n\nWait, no\u2014I think I'm overcomplicating.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, some of these might not be valid because they mention multiple parents crossing. Let me clarify: Each option seems to represent different scenarios, possibly involving two parents. For example, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would be a dihybrid cross between a Bb and a bb. But wait, since both parents can only contribute one allele for the coat color gene, perhaps the correct way to think about this is as a monohybrid cross.\n\nGiven that both parents have black coats, their possible genotypes must have at least one dominant allele (B). So, possible genotypes for each parent include BB or Bb. Now, when you make a cross between two parents, each parent can pass on either allele(s). Since there's only one gene involved here, each parent will pass either B or b. \n\nIf both parents are heterozygous (Bb), then each can produce a 50% chance of passing B and a 50% chance of passing b. When you cross two heterozygotes, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The phenotypic ratio would then be 3:1\u20143 individuals with BB or Bb (black) and 1 individual with bb (white). That matches exactly with the given data where \u00be are black and \u00bc are white. So, if both parents are Bb, the offspring would have the expected ratio. Let's check the other options quickly to ensure this is the correct answer.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. If both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning all would have white coats. This doesn't match the given data.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would get a b allele from the bb parent and an B from the BB parent, making them Bb. Again, all would have black coats, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Here, the BB parent will always give B, while the Bb parent has a 50% chance of giving B or b. So the offspring would have a 75% chance of being BB (all black) and 25% chance of being Bb (also all black, same phenotype). Wait no, actually, if one parent gives B and the other gives B or b, the offspring could be BB (if Bb gives B) or Bb (if Bb gives b). So the phenotypic ratio would still be \u00be black and \u00bc white, just like in option F. Hmm, maybe my initial thought was wrong. Wait, no, if the parents are Bb and BB, the possible offspring genotypes would be Bb (from Bb parent giving B and BB parent giving B) and B (from Bb parent giving b and BB parent giving B). So the phenotypic ratio would be \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc B (white), which is the same as \u00be black and \u00bc white. So this also fits. So why is this listed separately?\n\nBut wait, the question is about the genotypes of the parents. So, if the parents are Bb and BB, their genotypes are Bb and BB, respectively. Alternatively, if the parents are Bb and bb, their genotypes are Bb and bb, resulting in all offspring being Bb (black), which doesn't fit. So going back, if both parents are Bb, their genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white), which is exactly the case here. So option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 BB. So both are correct, but since the question asks for the most likely, and both H and F are similar, but in reality, both options lead to the same outcome. However, looking back at the options provided, perhaps I made a mistake earlier. Let me re-examine the options:\n\nLooking back, the options given are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo, the first part says \"the most likely\", implying a single correct answer. From the analysis, if the parents are both Bb (option H), the offspring will be \u00be Bb (black) and \u00bc bb (white). Another possibility is if one parent is Bb and the other is bb (option F), then all offspring will be Bb (black), which doesn't fit the data. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb (option C), the offspring would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%), so \u00be Bb (black), matching the data. Wait, that's another possibility. So both option C (BB \u00d7 Bb) and option H (Bb \u00d7 BB) would result in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. However, the question is about the genotype of the parents, not the offspring. So, if the parents are BB and Bb, their genotypes are BB and Bb. Or if the parents are Bb and BB, it's the same thing\u2014it's the same genotype pair, just swapped. So both C and H would be correct, but the question lists them as separate options. However, looking at the options, C is BB \u00d7 Bb, and H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is the same as Bb \u00d7 BB. So both are correct, but perhaps the intended answer is H, but I need to see if any other options fit better.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents would produce gametes: Bb produces B and b; bb produces b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (from Bb \u00d7 b) and bb (from bb \u00d7 b). Thus, 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white), which matches the data. So option F would work too. So now I'm confused because both options C and F seem to fit. But looking back, the question specifies \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\". So if the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, their genotypes are Bb and bb. Alternatively, if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, their genotypes are BB and Bb. Are these considered different scenarios? No, because the order doesn't matter\u2014they're just two different parents. So whether the parents are Bb and bb or BB and Bb, the genotype pairs are the same in terms of composition. Therefore, both C and F are correct, but in the options provided, perhaps only one of them is presented. Looking back, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb, matching the data. Option C is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in \u00be Bb and \u00bc bb. So both C and F are correct, but in the options, C and F are separate. But the question asks for the \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\" \u2014 which would imply a specific pairing. However, without more information, both C and F are correct. But in the options given, perhaps only one is correct. Wait, looking at the options, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would result in the correct ratio. Option C is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also works. So both are correct. However, perhaps the intended answer is H (BB \u00d7 Bb) because it's written as BB \u00d7 Bb, whereas option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. But both are equally correct. Maybe I should double-check the calculations.\n\nLet me verify the Punnett square for option F: Bb \u00d7 bb. The Bb parent can produce B or b, and the bb parent can only produce b. So the offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- Bb \u00d7 b = Bb (produced by Bb \u00d7 b)\n- bb \u00d7 b = bb (produced by bb \u00d7 b)\n\nSo the possible offspring genotypes are Bb and bb, with probabilities \u00be and \u00bc respectively. Phenotypically, Bb would be black, and bb would be white, which matches the given data. Similarly, for option C: BB \u00d7 Bb. The BB parent can only produce B, and the Bb parent can produce B or b. So:\n\n- B (from BB) \u00d7 B = BB (all black)\n- B (from BB) \u00d7 b = Bb (all black)\n\nThus, 75% BB (black) and 25% Bb (black), which also fits the data. So both F and C are correct. However, in the options, F is Bb \u00d7 bb and C is BB \u00d7 Bb. So which one is the correct answer? The question asks for the most likely genotype of the parents, so both options are correct, but perhaps only one is presented as an option. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is H, but I think both C and F are correct. However, looking back at the options, perhaps the correct answer is H, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, no\u2014the question is about the most likely genotype of the parents, which refers to the combination of their alleles. So both H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and F (Bb \u00d7 bb) are correct. However, the options don't have both together; instead, C and F are separate options. So perhaps the correct answer is both C and F, but in the context of the question, perhaps only one is meant. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is F, but I'm not certain.

When they cross, the offspring will have a 50% chance of being Bb and 50% of bb. So 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't match the 3:1 observed here.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to C. The offspring would be 50% BB (black) and 50% Bb (black, because B is dominant).

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

Hmm, maybe I need to consider the possible cross combinations and see which ones produce the observed 3:1 ratio.\n\nSo, first, let's recall that the 3:1 ratio comes from a monohybrid cross where one parent is homozygous recessive (e.g., bb) and the other is heterozygous (Bb). When you cross them, the F1 generation (the offspring) will have 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black). That gives exactly the 3:1 ratio mentioned here. Another possibility is that one parent is homozygous dominant (BB), and the other is also BB. Then all offspring would be BB, resulting in a 100% black coat, which doesn't fit our case. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be 75% B and 25% b, giving a 3:1 ratio as well. Wait, does that make sense?\n\nLet me think more clearly. Suppose one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous). The cross would look like:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 F1 would be B (from BB) and Bb (from Bb). Wait, no\u2014when you cross BB (which can only give B alleles) with Bb (which can give B or b), the offspring would all get B from BB and B or b from Bb. So the gametes would be B from BB and B/b from Bb. Thus, all offspring would receive B from the first parent and either B or b from the second. So their genotype would be BB (if they get B from both parents) and Bb (if they get b from the second parent). But wait, since the first parent is BB, all its gametes are B. So when it crosses with Bb, the F1 would be all B + B = BB and B + b = Bb. But that would lead to 50% BB and 50% Bb. However, according to the problem, 75% are B and 25% are b. That doesn't match. So perhaps my initial thought was wrong.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then the cross would be Bb \u00d7 Bb. The possible offspring genotypes would be:\n\n- BB (25%) \n- Bb (50%) \n- bb (25%)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1, matching the problem statement. Because BB and Bb express the dominant trait (black), while bb shows the recessive (white).\n\nLooking back at the options, option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\" which fits this scenario. So why are there other options? For example, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would result in 75% B and 25% b, which would not give us 3:1. Instead, it would give 75% BB and 25% Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio only if the other parent is bb. So the correct parents must be Bb and bb, making the cross Bb \u00d7 bb, which results in 75% Bb (black) and 25% bb (white), hence 3:1.\n\nBut wait, another thing to consider is whether the parents could be BB and Bb. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross would result in 75% B and 25% b. But since the BB parent can only pass on B alleles, the F1 would be 75% BB and 25% Bb. This would mean that the phenotype ratio is 3:1 (black to brown, say), which matches the problem. However, in the problem, the ratio is 3:1, so either scenario works. But wait, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 would have 75% BB and 25% Bb, leading to a 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if both parents are Bb, the F1 would be 75% Bb and 25% bb, which is also 3:1.\n\nNow, looking at the options, option D is \"bb \u00d7 bb\", which would produce 100% Bb, which doesn't fit the problem's 3:1 ratio. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\", same as above. Option C is \"bb \u00d7 Bb\", which is correct. Option E is \"bb \u00d7 BB\", same as above. Option I is \"BB \u00d7 bb\", same as C. Option J is \"BB \u00d7 BB\", which produces 100% BB, not matching.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C or any of the others that involve Bb and bb. Wait, but the question asks for the most likely genotypes of the parents. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, that's option C. Alternatively, if both parents are Bb, that would also work, but that's not an option listed.

That doesn't make sense because the parents should be a pair, not two different pairs. Maybe option B is two separate cross-pairs: one BB \u00d7 BB and another Bb \u00d7 bb. Hmm, perhaps they meant to combine into a larger cross. Alternatively, maybe the parents are two separate animals, each being a cross on their own. But more likely, each option represents a possible cross between two animals.\n\nSo, first, let me consider each option:\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. If both parents are homozygous recessive, then every offspring will be bb, meaning all white coats. That can't produce the observed \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio, so D is out.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. The parent with bb is homozygous recessive, and BB is homozygous dominant. Crossing them would always result in BB offspring, so all black. Again, not matching the required ratio.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. One parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). When crossing, each gamete from Bb is B or b, and bb produces only b. So the possible offspring genotypes are Bb (from B gamete + b from bb) and bb (from b + b). The phenotypes would be black (for Bb) and white (for bb). So the ratio would be 50% black and 50% white. But the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white. So F isn't correct.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As above with option E, this would result in all BB (homozygous dominant), so all black. Not matching.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Similar to E and F, the parent Bb will produce B or b, while BB produces B. So offspring would be BB (75%) and Bb (25%). Phenotypes: 75% black, 25% brown (if Bb is brown). Wait, but the problem says black and white. Let me check the dominance direction. The problem says black is dominant over white. So if the genotype is Bb, the phenotype would be black. Therefore, the ratio would be 75% black and 25% white, which matches the problem statement. So this seems promising.\n\nBut wait, let me think deeper. Are there any other possibilities?\n\nLooking back at the initial setup: the parents must be such that when crossed, the ratio is 3:1 for the coat colors. That means each offspring has a 3/4 chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and 1/4 chance of having none (white). This typically happens in cases where the parents are heterozygotes (Bb) and Bb. Because in a dihybrid cross, the expected ratio is 9:3:3:1, but in this case, since it's a monohybrid situation, it simplifies to 3:1. Wait, but this might depend on whether there are multiple genes involved here. However, the problem mentions \"guinea pigs,\" which usually don't have multiple coat genes; they have one, so monoallelic expression applies. Thus, each animal's coat is determined by a single gene, making the analysis straightforward.\n\nSo, going back to the options, let's see which ones lead to a 3:1 ratio. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. The parents are BB (homozygous dominant) and Bb (heterozygous). The possible offspring genotypes would be BB (from BB) and Bb (from Bb). The phenotypes would be black (BB) and black (Bb), so all offspring are black. That gives a 100% black coat, which doesn't match the 75% black and 25% white stated in the problem. So H is incorrect.\n\nWait, that contradicts my earlier thought. Let me re-examine. If the parents are BB and Bb, then the cross is BB \u00d7 Bb. The possible gametes from BB are B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring would get either B (from BB) plus B (from Bb) = BB, or B (from BB) plus b (from Bb) = Bb. Both BB and Bb have the same phenotype (black), so the ratio would indeed be 100% black. That can't explain the 3:1 ratio described in the problem. Therefore, H is not the answer.\n\nWait, so going back to the original options, perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating option G and H. Let me clarify:\n\n- For a 3:1 ratio in a monohybrid cross, the parents must be heterozygous (Bb) and Bb. So, the cross would yield 3/4 BB (black) and 1/4 bb (white).\n\nTherefore, the correct parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. So that's the correct pair.\n\nLet me check the other options again:\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 ratio is 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), which is 1:1, not 3:1.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (black), so 1:0.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (black), so 1:0.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 all Bb (black), 1:0.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 all bb (white), 0:1.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This is ambiguous because it presents two separate crosses. If each cross results in all BB or all Bb respectively, combining them would still give all BB, which leads to 1:0. Or if the parents are mixed as a single cross, say BB \u00d7 Bb, you'd get 3/4 BB and 1/4 bb, which fits the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but option B is written as \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\". That seems like two independent crosses. Each cross's outcome would be all black or all brown (assuming Bb becomes brown). But if the two parents are separate, say, one is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be BB \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 75% black and 25% brown. But the problem refers to the cross between two guinea pigs, implying a single cross involving two animals. So perhaps the intended interpretation was that the parents are a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, making the answer A.\n\nAlternatively, considering that option B includes two separate crosses, but the problem describes a single cross between two individuals, perhaps the intended answer is A. However, according to standard genetic terminology, when a problem asks for the parents of an organism resulting in a certain trait ratio, unless specified otherwise, the parent pairs are considered together in a single cross. Hence, the correct answer should be A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So that's the correct pair.\n\nLet me check the other options again:\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 ratio is 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), which is 1:1, not 3:1.\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (black), so 1:0.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 all BB (black), so 1:0.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 all Bb (black), 1:0.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 all bb (white), 0:1.\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. This is ambiguous because it presents two separate crosses. If each cross results in all BB or all Bb respectively, combining them would still give all BB, which leads to 1:0. Or if the parents are mixed as a single cross, say BB \u00d7 Bb, you'd get 3/4 BB and 1/4 bb, which fits the 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but option B is written as \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\". That seems like two independent crosses. Each cross's outcome would be all black or all brown (assuming Bb becomes brown). But if the two parents are separate, say, one is BB and the other is Bb, then the cross would be BB \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 75% black and 25% brown. But the problem refers to the cross between two guinea pigs, implying a single cross involving two animals. So perhaps the intended interpretation was that the parents are a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, making the answer A.\n\nAlternatively, considering that option B includes two separate crosses, but the problem describes a single cross between two individuals, perhaps the intended answer is A. However, according to standard genetic terminology, when a problem asks for the parents of an organism resulting in a certain trait ratio, unless specified otherwise, the parent pairs are considered together in a single cross. Hence, the correct answer should be A: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, no, actually, looking back, the user provided a list where the parents are listed as pairs. For example, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, etc. But the question says \"genotypes of the parents were most likely\", implying that perhaps there are two parents, and their combined genotype possibilities need to be considered. Alternatively, maybe the parents are being crossed twice, but that seems less likely. Wait, the way the options are structured, each pair represents the possible parents. Hmm, perhaps the answer involves identifying the correct pair of parents whose gametes produce the observed phenotypic ratio.\n\nSo, since the offspring show a 3:1 ratio, which typically corresponds to a dihybrid cross when considering two different genes, but here we're dealing with a single gene. However, wait, the coat color is determined by one gene, so if the parents are heterozygous (Bb), then the expected phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (dominant to recessive). That matches exactly what's happening here\u2014three-quarters black, one-quarter white. Therefore, if the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, that would produce the observed ratio. Now, looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, and option C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and option I is BB \u00d7 bb. Wait, but according to my earlier reasoning, the correct answer should be option G or C?\n\nWait, hold on. If the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then each parent can produce gametes with B or b. So the Punnett square would look like:\n\nBb x Bb \u2192 B/B, B/b, b/B, b/b \u2192 resulting in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Then, converting to coat colors: BB and Bb would give black, while bb gives white. So indeed, 75% black, 25% white, matching the data. So option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, but BB can't produce any b alleles. So if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the possible gametes from BB are all B, and from Bb are B and b. So the cross would be:\n\nBB (B) x Bb (B and b) \u2192 All offspring will get B from the first parent and either B or b from the second. So the genotypes would be BB (if B from Bb), Bb (if b from Bb). Thus, the phenotype would be black for all individuals because BB and Bb are both dominant. Wait, that doesn't make sense because the observed data shows some white animals. So if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would all be black, not showing any white coat. Hence, that wouldn't match the observed ratio. Therefore, option G might not be correct.\n\nWait, now I'm confused. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let's think again. If both parents are Bb, then the cross would yield 75% black and 25% white, which fits. But if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be BB (100%) and Bb (50%), so all black. So that can't explain the white coats. Therefore, the parents must be Bb and Bb, making option G incorrect because in that case, the other possibility is option H, which is BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant), and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then all offspring would inherit B from the Bb parent and either B or b from the BB parent. So all offspring would be B_, meaning black, which contradicts the observation. Hence, option G (Bb \u00d7 BB) also leads to all black. Therefore, neither of those makes sense.\n\nWait, but the correct parents are both Bb, right? Because that would lead to the 3:1 ratio. So why am I getting conflicting results? Let me double-check. When you cross two Bb parents, each produces four gametes: BB, Bb, Bb, bb. So the Punnett square would be:\n\nBB | Bb | Bb | bb  \n---|---|---|---  \nBb | BB | Bb | Bb  \nBb | BB | Bb | Bb  \nbb | Bb | Bb | bb  \n\nNow, counting the phenotypes: BB and Bb are black; bb is white. The frequency of each:\n\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50% (from BB + Bb)\n- bb: 25%\n\nBut wait, in reality, each Bb parent contributes 50% B and 50% b. So combining two Bb parents, the total would be:\n\nEach parent contributes B or b.\n\nThe probability of each combination:\n- BB: 25%\n- Bb: 50%\n- bb: 25%\n\nTherefore, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (black:white).\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. As discussed, this would produce all black, which is incorrect. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. This would produce 75% black, 25% white, same as option G. Wait, so both G and H seem to produce the same ratio. But the question asks for the most likely parents based on the options provided.\n\nWait, perhaps I missed something. Let me re-examine the options. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, and option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Both would result in a 3:1 ratio. So why are they presented separately? Maybe I need to consider whether the order matters or not. But in this case, the parents are just two separate individuals, so swapping them wouldn't change the outcome. Therefore, both G and H would produce the same ratio, but the options are distinct. Perhaps the answer depends on another factor, such as dominance status. If both parents are Bb, then the F1 will all be B_. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, all F1s would be B_. Similarly, if one is BB and the other is bb, then all F1s would be B_ because B_ is dominant. Wait, no\u2014if one parent is BB and the other is bb, then the F1 would receive B from the BB parent and b from the bb parent, resulting in B_, hence black. Therefore, in all cases where at least one parent is Bb, the F1 will be B_, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Whereas if both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all F1s will be bb, resulting in 100% white.\n\nGiven that the observed data includes both black and white coats, the parents cannot be both homozygous recessive. Also, the presence of at least one B allele in the parents ensures that the F1 will express the dominant trait. Therefore, the most likely parents must carry at least one dominant allele. Looking back at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all black. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same thing. F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would lead to all black as well. E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all white. D is bb \u00d7 bb, all white. J is BB \u00d7 BB, all black.\n\nSo among the options, G, H, F, E, D, J all result in all black or all white offspring. Only option C, bb \u00d7 Bb, would result in a 25% white and 75% black ratio, similar to the case when both parents are Bb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. If both parents are Bb, the F1 is 75% B_, 25% bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 is 75% B_, 25% bb. So the presence of at least one dominant allele in the parents allows the F1 to express the dominant trait, regardless of the other parent's genotype.\n\nWait, so if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 is B_. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 is B_. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the F1 is B_. If both parents are Bb, F1 is B_ (75% black, 25% white). So the key is that if at least one parent is Bb, the F1 will be B_ and exhibit the dominant trait. Therefore, the presence of at least one B allele in the parents ensures that the F1 will be B_.\n\nLooking back at the options, G and H are Bb \u00d7 something else, whereas C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 25% white. Therefore, the correct parents must have at least one B allele. So options G, H, F, E, D, J are all possibilities except C. Among these, the most likely parents are those who are heterozygous (Bb), assuming that the other parent may also be Bb, which would produce the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, it still works because BB is homozygous dominant and will contribute B alleles to the offspring. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would always get at least one B allele from the Bb parent, so the other parent's genotype doesn't matter beyond ensuring that the B alleles are passed on.\n\nThus, the most likely parents are those who are Bb, which would allow the F1 to be B_ and exhibit the dominant trait. Therefore, the correct answer is that the parents are both Bb, which would correspond to option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no\u2014option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B_ offspring, which doesn't fit the data. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIf one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then every offspring will receive B from the Bb parent and either B or b from the BB parent. So all offspring will have B_, thus expressing the dominant phenotype (black). This would result in a 100% black phenotype, which does not match the observed 75% black and 25% white.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, then each parent can contribute B or b. The possible gametes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The F1 will thus have:\n\n- 25% BB (black)\n- 50% Bb (black)\n- 25% bb (white)\n\nWhich gives a 3:1 ratio, fitting the observed data. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce all B_ and thus all black, which doesn't fit. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also leads to all B_ offspring, same issue. Options F, E, D, J all lead to all white offspring, which doesn't fit. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the parents are both Bb, which is not present in the options. Wait, no, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, the user wrote the options as pairs, so each pair is an option. So, the options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nAh, okay, so the options are individual pairs. So, the correct parents must be one pair where both parents are Bb, which is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. No, wait, BB is homozygous dominant. So option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. If both parents are Bb and BB respectively, that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both Bb. So the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G. But option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which is different. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the options provided, the correct pair that results in 3:1 ratio is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would be option G if it's Bb \u00d7 BB, but that's not correct. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual correct pair is both Bb, which would be option G if it's Bb \u00d7 Bb. But in the options, option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce all B_ offspring, which doesn't fit the data. So perhaps none of the options correctly represent the parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the options.\n\nWait, let's approach it differently. The correct answer is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in a 3:1 ratio. Looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't produce the desired ratio. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in all B_ offspring, same as option G. So none of the options correctly show the parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in the observed ratio. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the options again.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the F1 would be 75% B_ and 25% bb, same as when both parents are Bb. So the parents in option G would result in the same 3:1 ratio as when both are Bb. So in that case, option G would also produce the correct ratio. But earlier, I thought that option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. So perhaps the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, even though it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB instead of Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option G despite the notation discrepancy. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in a 25% white and 75% black ratio, but that doesn't match the data.\n\nWait, no, the observed data is 75% black and 25% white. So the correct parents must produce at least one dominant allele in the offspring. Therefore, the correct pair must include at least one B allele. So options G, H, F, E, D, J are candidates, as they involve at least one Bb parent. But the correct answer must be among these, but none of the options directly state Bb \u00d7 Bb. The closest is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB, which, as discussed, would result in all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, despite the notation error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another angle: if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all offspring would be Bb, resulting in 100% black. Which doesn't fit. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, all offspring are B_, same as above. If one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring are B_, same as before. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then the F1 will be 75% B_ and 25% bb, which is the correct ratio. Therefore, the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, assuming a typo in the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB, but that would produce all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. Therefore, perhaps none of the options perfectly reflect the correct parents, but the intended answer is option G.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the options. Let me list all the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo the correct parents must produce a 3:1 ratio, which happens when both parents are Bb. But none of the options explicitly say Bb \u00d7 Bb. However, option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the notation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a point. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possibility: the F1 ratio is 3:1, which occurs when at least one dominant allele is present in the parents. So any pair where at least one parent is Bb would produce the correct ratio, regardless of the other parent's genotype, as long as it's Bb. Therefore, the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would be option G if it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, despite the notation, as it's the only one that meets the condition of producing the required ratio.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option G. Even though it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB, it's likely that the intended answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Therefore, in all cases where at least one parent is Bb, the F1 will be B_, leading to 75% black and 25% white. Whereas if both parents are homozygous recessive (bb), then all F1s will be bb, resulting in 100% white.\n\nGiven that the observed data includes both black and white coats, the parents cannot be both homozygous recessive. Also, the presence of at least one B allele in the parents ensures that the F1 will express the dominant trait. Therefore, the most likely parents must carry at least one dominant allele. Looking back at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all black. H is BB \u00d7 Bb, same thing. F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would lead to all black as well. E is bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all white. D is bb \u00d7 bb, all white. J is BB \u00d7 BB, all black.\n\nSo among the options, G, H, F, E, D, J all result in all black or all white offspring. Only option C, bb \u00d7 Bb, would result in a 25% white and 75% black ratio, similar to the case when both parents are Bb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. If both parents are Bb, the F1 is 75% B_, 25% bb. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 is 75% B_, 25% bb. So the presence of at least one dominant allele in the parents allows the F1 to express the dominant trait, regardless of the other parent's genotype.\n\nWait, so if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the F1 is B_. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the F1 is B_. Similarly, if one parent is BB and the other is bb, the F1 is B_. If both parents are Bb, F1 is B_ (75% black, 25% white). So the key is that if at least one parent is Bb, the F1 will be B_ and exhibit the dominant trait. Therefore, the presence of at least one B allele in the parents ensures that the F1 will be B_.\n\nLooking back at the options, G and H are Bb \u00d7 something else, whereas C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 25% white. Therefore, the correct parents must have at least one B allele. So options G, H, F, E, D, J are all possibilities except C. Among these, the most likely parents are those who are heterozygous (Bb), assuming that the other parent may also be Bb, which would produce the 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, it still works because BB is homozygous dominant and will contribute B alleles to the offspring. Wait, no\u2014the F1 would always get at least one B allele from the Bb parent, so the other parent's genotype doesn't matter beyond ensuring that the B alleles are passed on.\n\nThus, the most likely parents are those who are Bb, which would allow the F1 to be B_ and exhibit the dominant trait. Therefore, the correct answer is that the parents are both Bb, which would correspond to option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. Wait, no\u2014option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B_ offspring, which doesn't fit the data. Wait, I'm getting myself mixed up. Let me clarify once more.\n\nIf one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then every offspring will receive B from the Bb parent and either B or b from the BB parent. So all offspring will have B_, thus expressing the dominant phenotype (black). This would result in a 100% black phenotype, which does not match the observed 75% black and 25% white.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, then each parent can contribute B or b. The possible gametes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). The F1 will thus have:\n\n- 25% BB (black)\n- 50% Bb (black)\n- 25% bb (white)\n\nWhich gives a 3:1 ratio, fitting the observed data. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce all B_ and thus all black, which doesn't fit. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also leads to all B_ offspring, same issue. Options F, E, D, J all lead to all white offspring, which doesn't fit. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the parents are both Bb, which is not present in the options. Wait, no, perhaps I misread the options.\n\nLet me check the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, the user wrote the options as pairs, so each pair is an option. So, the options are:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nAh, okay, so the options are individual pairs. So, the correct parents must be one pair where both parents are Bb, which is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB. No, wait, BB is homozygous dominant. So option G is Bb \u00d7 BB. If both parents are Bb and BB respectively, that doesn't align with our earlier analysis. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both Bb. So the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G. But option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which is different. Wait, no\u2014actually, in the options provided, the correct pair that results in 3:1 ratio is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would be option G if it's Bb \u00d7 BB, but that's not correct. Wait, I'm getting confused.\n\nWait, no\u2014the actual correct pair is both Bb, which would be option G if it's Bb \u00d7 Bb. But in the options, option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which would produce all B_ offspring, which doesn't fit the data. So perhaps none of the options correctly represent the parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb. Alternatively, perhaps I've made a mistake in evaluating the options.\n\nWait, let's approach it differently. The correct answer is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which results in a 3:1 ratio. Looking at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't produce the desired ratio. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also results in all B_ offspring, same as option G. So none of the options correctly show the parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in the observed ratio. Wait, but perhaps I'm missing something. Let me reconsider the options again.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the F1 would be 75% B_ and 25% bb, same as when both parents are Bb. So the parents in option G would result in the same 3:1 ratio as when both are Bb. So in that case, option G would also produce the correct ratio. But earlier, I thought that option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, which would lead to all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. So perhaps the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, but that's not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, even though it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB instead of Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended answer is option G despite the notation discrepancy. Or maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option C: bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in a 25% white and 75% black ratio, but that doesn't match the data.\n\nWait, no, the observed data is 75% black and 25% white. So the correct parents must produce at least one dominant allele in the offspring. Therefore, the correct pair must include at least one B allele. So options G, H, F, E, D, J are candidates, as they involve at least one Bb parent. But the correct answer must be among these, but none of the options directly state Bb \u00d7 Bb. The closest is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB, which, as discussed, would result in all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. So perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, despite the notation error, or perhaps I'm missing something.\n\nWait, another angle: if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then all offspring would be Bb, resulting in 100% black. Which doesn't fit. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, all offspring are B_, same as above. If one parent is BB and the other is bb, all offspring are B_, same as before. If one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, then the F1 will be 75% B_ and 25% bb, which is the correct ratio. Therefore, the correct pair is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is not an option. Therefore, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G, assuming a typo in the notation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the intended correct answer is option G: Bb \u00d7 BB, but that would produce all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. Therefore, perhaps none of the options perfectly reflect the correct parents, but the intended answer is option G.\n\nWait, perhaps I made a mistake in analyzing the options. Let me list all the options again:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nSo the correct parents must produce a 3:1 ratio, which happens when both parents are Bb. But none of the options explicitly say Bb \u00d7 Bb. However, option G is written as Bb \u00d7 BB, which would result in all B_ offspring, same as when both parents are Bb. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is option G, despite the notation. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing a point. Let me think again.\n\nAnother possibility: the F1 ratio is 3:1, which occurs when at least one dominant allele is present in the parents. So any pair where at least one parent is Bb would produce the correct ratio, regardless of the other parent's genotype, as long as it's Bb. Therefore, the correct parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would be option G if it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB. Alternatively, perhaps the correct answer is option G, despite the notation, as it's the only one that meets the condition of producing the required ratio.\n\nIn conclusion, the most likely parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option G. Even though it's written as Bb \u00d7 BB, it's likely that the intended answer is option G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Therefore, the phenotypes would be BB (black) and Bb (black), while bb (white) wouldn't occur because neither parent gives a b allele. Thus, the offspring would be 100% black, which contradicts the given information of \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nOh wait, that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me reconsider.

Let me approach this systematically.\n\nFirstly, the offspring ratio is 3:1, which is typical for a monohybrid cross when there are no incomplete dominances or other factors. So, the parents must be heterozygous for the trait they exhibit. But wait, both parents here have black coats, so their alleles for that gene would contribute to the pigment production. However, since the ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, it implies that both parents are carriers because otherwise, if they were homozygous for black, all offspring would also be black. That doesn't fit the data, so probably both parents are heterozygous (Bb).\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If both parents are Bb, then crossing them would result in offspring with a 25% chance of being BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Then, the coat colors would be determined based on whether they have at least one B allele (black) or not (white). So:\n\nBB \u2192 black  \nBb \u2192 black  \nbb \u2192 white  \n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (three black and one white), which matches the given data. Therefore, if the parents are both Bb, then their genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would correspond to option G.\n\nBut wait, the options include F as Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me check why that might be. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would have 50% Bb and 50% bb. When considering coat color, Bb would express black and bb would express white. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 (since half are Bb and half are bb). That doesn't match the 3:1 ratio given, so F wouldn't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, resulting in a 100% black coat, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Again, that leads to a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our 3:1.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would be bb (white) and BB (black), leading to a 1:1 ratio. Not matching.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all bb (white) offspring. That's extreme and definitely not matching the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Crossing BB (homozygous dominant) with Bb (heterozygous) would give offspring 50% BB and 50% Bb. Same as before, resulting in a 1:1 phenotype ratio.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Similar logic, same outcome.\n\nOption A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which we've already established gives a 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption B is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, that seems like multiple crosses, but the way the question is phrased, the parents are crossed once. So perhaps option B refers to a scenario where one parent is BB and another is Bb, which would lead to a 1:1 ratio.

If both parents are Bb, then the F1 generation would have a 25% chance of being BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, matching the given data.

So, the parents must be heterozygous for the trait they exhibit. But wait, both parents here have black coats, so their alleles for that gene would contribute to the pigment production. However, since the ratio is \u00be black and \u00bc white, it implies that both parents are carriers because otherwise, if they were homozygous for black, all offspring would also be black. That doesn't fit the data, so probably both parents are heterozygous (Bb).\n\nWait, but let me confirm. If both parents are Bb, then crossing them would result in offspring with a 25% chance of being BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. Then, the coat colors would be determined based on whether they have at least one B allele (black) or not (white). So:\n\nBB \u2192 black  \nBb \u2192 black  \nbb \u2192 white  \n\nSo the phenotypic ratio would be 3:1 (three black and one white), which matches the given data. Therefore, if the parents are both Bb, then their genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would correspond to option G.\n\nBut wait, the options include F as Bb \u00d7 bb. Let me check why that might be. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the offspring would have 50% Bb and 50% bb. When considering coat color, Bb would express black and bb would express white. So the phenotypic ratio would be 1:1 (since half are Bb and half are bb). That doesn't match the 3:1 ratio given, so F wouldn't be correct.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are BB, then all offspring would be BB, resulting in a 100% black coat, which contradicts the 3:1 ratio.\n\nIf one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 50% BB and 50% Bb. Again, that leads to a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit our 3:1.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similarly, all offspring would be bb (white) and BB (black), leading to a 1:1 ratio. Not matching.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all bb (white) offspring. That's extreme and definitely not matching the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Crossing BB (homozygous dominant) with Bb (heterozygous) would give offspring 50% BB and 50% Bb. Same as before, resulting in a 1:1 phenotype ratio.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. Similar logic, same outcome.\n\nOption A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which we've already established gives a 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption B is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. Wait, that seems like multiple crosses, but the way the question is phrased, the parents are crossed once. So perhaps option B refers to a scenario where one parent is BB and another is Bb, which would lead to a 1:1 ratio. Alternatively, maybe it's referring to different possible pairs, but I'm not sure.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is suggesting that the parents themselves are each a combination, but the answer choices don't reflect that. Alternatively, perhaps the parents are both Bb, making option A the correct choice.\n\nLet me double-check the reasoning. If both parents are Bb, then the F1 generation would have a 25% chance of being BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). So the phenotypic ratio is 3:1, matching the given data. Therefore, the parents' genotypes are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option G.\n\nLooking back at the options provided, yes, option G is \"Bb \u00d7 Bb\". So that's the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Let me think more clearly.\n\nThe key here is understanding the possible outcomes based on the parents' genotypes. Since the ratio is 3:1, the parents must be heterozygous for the gene involved because if they were homozygous dominant (BB) or homozygous recessive (bb), the offspring would always show the same phenotype. So, the parents can't be both homozygous because then all the offspring would have the same genotype and coat color. Therefore, the parents must be heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb). That makes sense because when you cross two Bb parents, you get a 25% chance of each possible genotype: BB, Bb, and bb. But wait, the coat color is determined by the presence of at least one dominant allele (B). So, the coat color for each offspring would depend on whether they have at least one B allele.\n\nLet me calculate the expected phenotypic ratio. If both parents are Bb, then their gametes are B and b. Each parent can produce four combinations during meiosis: BB, Bb, Bb, and bb. When you combine these, the possible offspring genotypes are BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Now, since black is dominant, the bb genotype will express as white. So, the phenotypic ratio becomes 3:1\u2014three out of four offspring will be B (black) and one out of four will be b (white). That matches the given data perfectly. So, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which doesn't make sense because BB individuals can't contribute a b allele, leading to all offspring being BB (and thus black), which would give a 1:0 ratio instead of 3:1. Similarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which also wouldn't work because BB would lead to all black offspring. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would result in a 25% bb (white) and 75% Bb (black), giving a 3:1 ratio, but wait, does that happen?\n\nHold on, let me double-check. If one parent is bb (only b alleles) and the other is Bb (B and b), the possible gametes are b and B. So the offspring would get:\n\n- From the bb parent: b\n- From the Bb parent: B or b\n\nSo, possible offspring genotypes:\n- b + B = Bb (black)\n- b + b = bb (white)\n\nThe probability of each is 50%. So, 50% black, 50% white. That gives a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So that's incorrect. Then why did I initially think it was correct? Maybe I confused the calculation. Wait, no. Because the parents are Bb \u00d7 bb, each parent can pass either B or b. So, half the time an offspring gets B, making the genotype Bb (black), and half the time gets b, making bb (white). Thus, 50% black, 50% white. That's a 1:1 ratio, so that's wrong. Therefore, option C leads to a 1:1 ratio, which is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option C, both parents can only contribute b or B respectively. So, half the time, an offspring gets b from the bb parent, making bb (white), and half gets B from the BB parent, making Bb (black). Again, 50% white, 50% black, 1:1 ratio. Incorrect.\n\nOption D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive; all offspring will inherit bb, hence all white. So 100% white, which is different from the given 25% white.\n\nOption A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. As I thought earlier, this results in 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotypically, 75% black, 25% white. Which matches the given data exactly. So, the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which corresponds to option G.\n\nWait, hold on. Earlier I considered option F as Bb \u00d7 bb, which would give a 50% black and 50% white, which is incorrect. And option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which gives 75% black, 25% white. Correct.

Similarly, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which makes sense because bb is recessive and Bb can produce B and b.\n\nSo, considering the observed 3:1 ratio, I need to figure out which parent pairings would lead to that outcome. If the parents are Bb and Bb, then all the offspring would get either B or b from each parent, resulting in 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. But wait, in this case, the phenotype is based on whether they express the dominant B or not. Since B is dominant, any animal with at least one B allele will show black; otherwise, white. So, in this scenario, the expected phenotypic ratio would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white, matching the data given. Therefore, parents who are both Bb (option G) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, and 25% bb. All the B alleles would result in black, and the bb would result in white. That fits perfectly with \u00be black and \u00bc white.\n\nBut let me check other possibilities just to be thorough. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Each parent can produce gametes B and b. So, the possible offspring genotypes would be Bb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). Phenotypically, those would all be black since B is dominant. Wait, that would result in 100% black offspring, which doesn't match the 75% black and 25% white ratio. So, option F is incorrect.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar logic applies here. Each parent can produce gametes B and b. So, the offspring would be Bb (from B and b) and bb (from b and b). Again, all would be black, leading to 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. The Bb parent can produce B or b, while the BB parent always produces B. So, the possible offspring genotypes would be BB (from B and B) and Bb (from B and b). Phenotypically, all would be black, again 100% black. Not correct.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. As before, BB produces B, bb produces b. Offspring would be Bb (75%) and bb (25%). But wait, no\u2014since BB is homozygous dominant, all offspring would be Bb, meaning all would be black. Because in a cross like BB \u00d7 bb, the offspring would have one B and one b allele from each parent, making Bb. Since B is dominant, all would exhibit the dominant trait (black). So, again, 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. They would produce BB offspring, all. So, 100% black, which is incorrect.\n\nNow, going back to option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can contribute B or b. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- B from first parent and B from second \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B from first and b from second \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- b from first and B from second \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- b from first and b from second \u2192 bb (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Which matches exactly the given data: \u00be black, \u00bc white.\n\nLet me also consider option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. We already did that, which gives the correct ratio. So why does the answer not include option A as the genotype?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another possibility where the parents don't both carry the same genotype. No, because the parents must carry the necessary alleles to produce the given ratio. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: using Punnett squares. For a cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the square would show four possible combinations, each with equal probability. The number of Bs would determine the phenotype. Since each B from a parent gives the dominant trait, any presence of at least one B results in black. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 3:1, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are BB and Bb, their cross would be different. Let's see:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb: \nParent 1 (BB): B only.\nParent 2 (Bb): B and b.\nPossible offspring:\nBB (from B and B) \u2192 black\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\nbb (from b and b) \u2192 white\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would still be \u00be black, \u00bc white, same as before. Wait, but in this case, the parents aren't both Bb\u2014they\u2019re one BB and one Bb. So, according to our initial analysis, parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb would also give the correct ratio.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would yield the same phenotypic ratio. However, looking back at the options, option B includes \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which I thought was incorrect because it leads to 100% black. But perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating that option.\n\nWait, no, the option says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\" If both parents are BB and Bb, respectively, then yes, the offspring would all be Bb, leading to 100% black. Hence, option B wouldn't be correct.\n\nSimilarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would give 100% black. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same thing. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same issue. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as above.

So, again, 100% black, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant. They would produce BB offspring, all. So, 100% black, which is incorrect.\n\nNow, going back to option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb. Each parent can contribute B or b. So, the possible combinations are:\n\n- B from first parent and B from second \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B from first and b from second \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- b from first and B from second \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- b from first and b from second \u2192 bb (25%)\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio is 25% BB (black), 50% Bb (black), and 25% bb (white). Which matches exactly the given data: \u00be black, \u00bc white.\n\nLet me also consider option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb. We already did that, which gives the correct ratio. So why does the answer not include option A as the genotype?\n\nWait, perhaps there's another possibility where the parents don't both carry the same genotype. No, because the parents must carry the necessary alleles to produce the given ratio. Alternatively, maybe there's an error in my reasoning.\n\nWait, another approach: using Punnett squares. For a cross of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the square would show four possible combinations, each with equal probability. The number of Bs would determine the phenotype. Since each B from a parent gives the dominant trait, any presence of at least one B results in black. So, the phenotypic ratio is indeed 3:1, as calculated earlier.\n\nAlternatively, if the parents are BB and Bb, their cross would be different. Let's see:\n\nBB \u00d7 Bb: \nParent 1 (BB): B only.\nParent 2 (Bb): B and b.\nPossible offspring:\nBB (from B and B) \u2192 black\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\nBb (from B and b) \u2192 black\nbb (from b and b) \u2192 white\n\nSo, the phenotypic ratio would still be \u00be black, \u00bc white, same as before. Wait, but in this case, the parents aren't both Bb\u2014they\u2019re one BB and one Bb. So, according to our initial analysis, parents being Bb \u00d7 Bb would also give the correct ratio.\n\nHmm, now I'm confused because both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would yield the same phenotypic ratio. However, looking back at the options, option B includes \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb,\" which I thought was incorrect because it leads to 100% black. But perhaps I made a mistake in evaluating that option.\n\nWait, no, the option says \"BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb.\" If both parents are BB and Bb, respectively, then yes, the offspring would all be Bb, leading to 100% black. Hence, option B wouldn't be correct.\n\nSimilarly, option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which would give 100% black. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same thing. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, same issue. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, same as above. So, the only remaining correct option among the ones listed is G: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back at the original options provided, I notice that option G is present, along with others. So, the correct answer should be G. Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them:",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option B seems a bit confusing because it lists two possible parent pairs. Maybe it's a typo, but perhaps it's supposed to be two separate scenarios where F is presented as an example. Alternatively, maybe it's meant to represent a cross involving multiple possibilities. But regardless, the question is about which pair of parents would produce a \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio.\n\nSo, in a typical monohybrid cross (where one gene is involved and there are two alleles), the expected phenotypic ratio when crossing two heterozygotes (Bb \u00d7 Bb) is 3:1. That fits perfectly here because \u00be black and \u00bc white correspond to this ratio. Therefore, the parents must be heterozygous for the dominant trait. Looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Option G is also Bb \u00d7 BB, but wait, BB is homozygous dominant, while Bb is heterozygous. If you cross Bb \u00d7 BB, the offspring would be \u00bd Bb and \u00bd BB. Then, when considering coat color, since B is dominant, all offspring would express black (since B is present in both gametes). Wait no, hold on\u2014if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then all offspring would get B from the BB parent and b from the Bb parent, making Bb. All Bb individuals would show black coat color because B is dominant. So, in this case, all offspring would be Bb, hence all black. That doesn't match the \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio, so option G wouldn't fit.\n\nSimilarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. This would produce a \u00bd BB and \u00bd Bb. Since BB is homozygous dominant, they all have black coat color, and Bb produces 75% black and 25% white. So combining these, the ratio would be 75% + 25% = 100%, with 75% from BB and 25% from Bb. Wait, no\u2014actually, the total would be 50% Bb and 50% BB. So the ratio would be 50% black (from Bb) and 50% white (from Bb), which doesn't match the 3:1 ratio needed. So option H isn't correct.\n\nOption C is bb \u00d7 Bb. When you cross a homozygous recessive (bb) with a heterozygote (Bb), all offspring will receive the b allele from the bb parent and the B or b from the Bb parent. So their genotype would be Bb or bb. Since B is dominant, all individuals would have Bb or BB, right? Wait, no\u2014the offspring would get either B or b from the Bb parent, and b from the bb parent. So the possible genotypes are Bb (with B) and bb (with b). So all would have B unless they have bb. So the phenotype would be black for all except those who have bb, which would be white. So the ratio would be \u00be black and \u00bc white, matching the data. So option C seems correct.\n\nLet me double-check the other options just to be sure. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb. Both parents are homozygous recessive, so all offspring would be bb, thus all white. That doesn't fit.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option C, this would produce all Bb or BB, leading to all black. Not matching.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Same as C; all offspring would be Bb or bb, resulting in \u00be black and \u00bc white. So why is option F listed separately? Because it's another way to get the same ratio.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. This would produce \u00bd BB and \u00bd Bb. As before, 50% BB (all black) and 50% Bb (half black, half white). So the ratio would be 75% black and 25% white, not 75-25. So option I is incorrect.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. Both parents are homozygous dominant, so all offspring would be BB, hence all black. Doesn't fit.\n\nSo, options C and F both seem to lead to the desired ratio. But looking back at the options provided, does any of them say \"BB \u00d7 bb\" or \"Bb \u00d7 bb\"? Yes, option E is bb \u00d7 BB (same as option F), which is correct. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct too. However, the original answer choices include both C and F as possible answers, but looking at the options, option C is indeed correct. Wait, let me check the initial setup again. The question states that both parents are guinea pigs with black coats. So, the parents can be either BB or Bb. Now, among the options, option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. These are essentially the same scenario, differing only in order of parents. Whether the first parent is Bb and the second bb, or vice versa, the outcome is the same\u2014all offspring have Bb or bb, hence \u00be black and \u00bc white. So both options C and F are correct. However, the user instruction says to provide only a single letter, implying that only one option is correct. Wait, perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nWait, going back: the parents are both black-coated. So each parent must contribute either B or b. For the \u00be black to \u00bc white ratio, the parents must be heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb) or one homozygous dominant (BB \u00d7 Bb) or one homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 Bb). Wait, let me clarify:\n\nIf parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb:\nAll offspring are Bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white. Correct.\n\nIf parents are BB \u00d7 Bb:\nOffspring are 50% BB and 50% Bb.\nBB \u2192 100% black,\nBb \u2192 75% black, 25% white.\nTotal: 50% BB (100%) + 50% Bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white. So that works too.\n\nIf parents are bb \u00d7 Bb:\nAll offspring are Bb or bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white. Correct.\n\nBut the options don't have both C and F as separate options.

BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, option B is BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb. That's a bit unclear, but perhaps it's a way to present different parent combinations. However, based on the analysis, the correct parent combinations are:\n\nEither Bb \u00d7 Bb,\n\nOr BB \u00d7 Bb,\n\nOr bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nLooking at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb (correct),\n\noption C is bb \u00d7 Bb (correct),\n\nand option F is Bb \u00d7 bb (also correct).\n\nHowever, the user is expecting a single-letter answer. Wait, perhaps in the original problem statement, the options are labeled differently. Let me re-examine the exact wording of the question. It asks which is the most likely genotype for the parents. So, the correct options are A (Bb\u00d7Bb), C (bb\u00d7Bb), and F (Bb\u00d7bb). But the answer needs to be a single letter, so perhaps only one of these is correct based on some additional criteria.\n\nWait, perhaps the question expects us to consider that the parents are both Bb. So, option A is correct. But according to our analysis, options C and F are also correct. However, without more context, it's hard to tell. But perhaps the intended answer is A, Bb\u00d7Bb, as the standard dihybrid cross scenario.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question implies that the parents are both heterozygous, but that's not necessarily the case. So, I think the best approach is to select the option that correctly leads to the 3:1 ratio, which includes A, C, and F. However, since the user requires a single letter, perhaps the intended answer is A.\n\nWait, but let me double-check each possibility. Another way to approach this is to calculate the expected ratios for each parent combination.\n\nParent 1: Bb \u00d7 Parent 2: Bb  \nAll offspring are Bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white. Correct.\n\nParent 1: BB \u00d7 Parent 2: Bb  \nOffspring: 50% BB (100% black), 50% Bb (75% black, 25% white). Total: 50% + 75% = 125% black (but actual is 75% black and 25% white). Wait, no, because 50% BB \u2192 100% black, and 50% Bb \u2192 75% black, 25% white. So overall, 75% + (50% * 75%) = 75% + 37.5% = 112.5% black, which doesn't make sense. Wait, no, perhaps better to add fractions:\n\nBB (25%): 100% black.\n\nBb (50%): 75% black, 25% white.\n\nTotal black: 25% + (50% * 75%) = 25% + 37.5% = 62.5%.\n\nTotal white: 50% * 25% = 12.5%.\n\nThus, 62.5% black and 12.5% white. That doesn't match the 75% black to 25% white ratio. Hmm, so this contradicts my previous conclusion. So perhaps the correct parent combination should be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which gives exactly 75% black and 25% white.\n\nWait, but according to this calculation, when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white. Similarly, when one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the ratio is also 75% black and 25% white. When both parents are Bb, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white. So, in all cases except when both parents are BB, the ratio is 75% black and 25% white. So, if the parents are both Bb, it's correct. If one is BB and the other is Bb, it's still correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is also correct. Option F is Bb \u00d7 bb, which is correct too. So, depending on the options provided, which include multiple correct answers, but the user wants a single letter. Perhaps the intended answer is A, but others like C and F are also correct. However, the user might expect the parents to be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is the classic dihybrid cross.\n\nGiven that, I'll go with option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

If one is BB and the other is Bb, it's still correct.\n\nNow, looking back at the options, option A is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is correct. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which is also correct.

BB \u00d7 BB.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what kind of cross would produce a 3:1 ratio. A typical example is a dihybrid cross where both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), but wait, no\u2014wait, maybe not. Wait, no, because in a dihybrid cross, you get phenotypic ratios like 9:3:3:1 when considering two traits, but here we're dealing with just one trait. Alternatively, perhaps it's a monohybrid cross. But since the parents are both Bb \u00d7 Bb, their offspring would show a 3:1 ratio because each parent can contribute either B or b. So, for each parent, the possible gametes are B and b, each at 50%. When they mate, the Punnett square shows four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). Then, applying dominance, BB and Bb will be black (since B is dominant), and bb will be white. So indeed, the ratio would be 3:1:4? Wait, no, wait. Hold on, the total number is 4, right? So BB and Bb make up 75% (3 out of 4), and bb makes up 25%. That matches the description given in the problem. So if both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then the answer should be option G. But wait, let me check the options again. Option G is \"Bb \u00d7 BB\". Hmm, so that's different. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, then the possible gametes are B (from BB) and b (from Bb). Each parent produces these alleles in equal proportion. So the offspring would have:\n\nFrom BB: all B\nFrom Bb: 50% B and 50% b\n\nSo the possible combinations are:\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nNow, applying dominance: BB and Bb are black, bb is white. So the phenotype ratio is 3:1. Wait, but hold on\u2014the parents are Bb and BB. The BB parent will always pass B, so all gametes are B. The Bb parent can pass B or b. So the ratio is:\n\n- From BB: all B \u2192 100%\n- From Bb: 50% B and 50% b\n\nBut since BB is always B, the combined gametes are 50% B (from Bb) and 50% B (from BB). So overall, the offspring will have:\n\n- 50% B + B = 100% B (so BB)\n- 50% B + b = 50% Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014that's not quite right. Because when you combine the gametes, the offspring's genotype is based on the sum of the gametes. So each parent's gamete combines with theirs:\n\nEach offspring has two alleles. One comes from BB (always B), the other from Bb (either B or b).\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (if B from Bb)\n- Bb (if b from Bb)\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB and Bb \u2192 black\n- Bb \u2192 black? No, wait. Wait, no\u2014if one allele is B, it's dominant. So any presence of B results in black. So Bb is black, BB is black. Only bb is white.\n\nSo the ratio is:\n\n- 25% BB (all black)\n- 50% Bb (some black, some brown?) Wait no, the dominance applies regardless of which animal they are. Wait, no\u2014the animals themselves express the phenotype, so whether it's a pig named Peter or Paul doesn't matter; their color depends on the alleles.\n\nSo actually, the offspring would have:\n\n- 25% BB (all black)\n- 50% Bb (some black, some with one B and one b)\n- 25% bb (all white)\n\nThus, the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (black:white). Which matches the problem statement.\n\nSo in this case, the parents are Bb \u00d7 BB. So that corresponds to option G.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, but according to my analysis, yes. However, I had another thought earlier where I considered parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to same outcome. Now I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The parents are crossing to give both black coats. Both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would lead to the same 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the same 3:1 occurs.\n\nWait, but let me think about the other options. For instance, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. What happens there?\n\nIf one parent is BB (always B) and the other is Bb (50% B, 50% b):\n\nThe possible gametes are B from BB and B and b from Bb.\n\nSo the offspring's genotypes are:\n\n- B from BB + B from Bb \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B from BB + b from Bb \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- B from BB + B from Bb \u2192 BB (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent produces gametes independently. So the Bb parent can produce B or b, while the BB parent can only produce B. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- From BB parent: B\n- From Bb parent: B or b\n\nSo combining:\n\n- All offspring receive B from BB, so their genotype is either B (if they also get B from Bb) or Bb (if they get b from Bb).\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotype-wise, BB and Bb are black, bb is white. So the ratio is 3:1. So the parents being BB \u00d7 Bb would also produce a 3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, so both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would result in 3:1. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 BB would also result in 3:1. So why does option G say Bb \u00d7 BB and option H says BB \u00d7 Bb?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB.\n\nWhen Bb \u00d7 BB is crossed:\n\nBB parent can only give B.\n\nBb parent gives B or b.\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 BB (25%)\n- Bb (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (50%)\n\nSo phenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), bb (white). Ratio 3:1.\n\nSimilarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Same reasoning: BB can only give B, Bb can give B or b. So same result: 3:1.\n\nBut in the initial consideration, I thought that Bb \u00d7 Bb would also produce a 3:1. So why are options G and H correct? Or did I misunderstand the options?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo options G and H are both Bb \u00d7 BB and BB \u00d7 Bb respectively. They both produce 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the actual cross outcomes.\n\nIn a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, each parent can produce B or b gametes. The Punnett square is:\n\n   | B | b\n---|---|---\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black (25%)\n- Bb: black (50%)\n- bb: white (25%)\n\nTotal: 3:1.\n\nIn a Bb \u00d7 BB cross, the Bb parent can produce B or b, while BB can only produce B.\n\nSo the Punnett square becomes:\n\n   | B | B\n---|---|---\nB | BB | BB\nb | Bb | Bb\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (50%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes: BB and Bb are black, so 100% black and 0% white. That's a 1:0 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOh! Wait, that's a key point. So if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the ratio is 1:0 instead of 3:1. Because the Bb parent can produce B or b, but the BB parent can only produce B. Therefore, the offspring will always have at least one B, making all of them either BB or Bb, hence all black. That contradicts the problem statement which says 3/4 black and 1/4 white.\n\nTherefore, the correct parents must be both Bb \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the children would have:\n\nAll offspring inherit B from the BB parent. The Bb parent can pass either B or b.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from Bb and BB)\n- Bb (from Bb and BB)\n\nBoth are black. So the ratio is 100%, not 3:1. Therefore, parents cannot be Bb \u00d7 BB. Thus, the only way to get 3:1 is if both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which would yield Bb (which is black) and bb (white), giving a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nSo going back to the original options, the only pair that leads to a 3:1 ratio is when both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb (option G) or when one parent is Bb and the other is BB (but that doesn't work, as shown above). Wait, no\u2014it worked when the parents are both Bb \u00d7 Bb (G) and also when one parent is Bb and the other is BB (H), but H doesn't work because it gives 1:0 ratio.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought that option G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) both produce 3:1, but upon closer inspection, option H doesn't. Because when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring are all B, so 100% black, not 3:1.\n\nSo only option G, where both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, would produce a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is G.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I got the cross wrong. Let me consider each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 mixed crosses, probably not relevant as the problem states both parents.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 1:3 ratio (only bb and Bb \u2192 25% and 75%?)\n\nNo, wait: bb (25%) and Bb (50%) \u2192 phenotypes: 25% white, 50% black. So 1:2 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 100% white \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% bb (white), 75% BB (black) \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 similar to E: 75% black, 25% white \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 1:0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as E: 75% black, 25% white \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 75% BB, 25% bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo options A, E, F, I, J produce 3:1. Options B, C, D, H produce less. Option G also produces 3:1.\n\nBut the question asks for the most likely genotype, meaning the cross that would produce 3:1. So multiple options could theoretically produce 3:1, but perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but in reality, both G and H produce 3:1. Let me see if I made an error in evaluating H.\n\nH is BB \u00d7 Bb. As I analyzed before, the offspring would all have at least one B allele, so all black, thus 100% black. Therefore, H doesn't match the 3:1 ratio required in the problem.\n\nSo the only options that produce 3:1 are A, E, F, I, J, and G. But among those, the most straightforward answer is G, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back, I initially thought that G and H are both possible, but H doesn't fit. So the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene.

So that corresponds to option G.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought option G was Bb \u00d7 BB, but according to my analysis, yes. However, I had another thought earlier where I considered parents as Bb \u00d7 Bb, leading to same outcome. Now I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me re-examine the problem. The parents are crossing to give both black coats. Both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which would lead to the same 3:1 ratio. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the same 3:1 occurs.\n\nWait, but let me think about the other options. For instance, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. What happens there?\n\nIf one parent is BB (always B) and the other is Bb (50% B, 50% b):\n\nThe possible gametes are B from BB and B and b from Bb.\n\nSo the offspring's genotypes are:\n\n- B from BB + B from Bb \u2192 BB (25%)\n- B from BB + b from Bb \u2192 Bb (50%)\n- B from BB + B from Bb \u2192 BB (25%)\n\nWait, no\u2014each parent produces gametes independently. So the Bb parent can produce B or b, while the BB parent can only produce B. So the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- From BB parent: B\n- From Bb parent: B or b\n\nSo combining:\n\n- All offspring receive B from BB, so their genotype is either B (if they also get B from Bb) or Bb (if they get b from Bb).\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (25%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotype-wise, BB and Bb are black, bb is white. So the ratio is 3:1. So the parents being BB \u00d7 Bb would also produce a 3:1 ratio.\n\nHmm, so both Bb \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 Bb would result in 3:1. Similarly, Bb \u00d7 BB would also result in 3:1. So why does option G say Bb \u00d7 BB and option H says BB \u00d7 Bb?\n\nWait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me clarify.\n\nOption G is Bb \u00d7 BB.\n\nWhen Bb \u00d7 BB is crossed:\n\nBB parent can only give B.\n\nBb parent gives B or b.\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 BB (25%)\n- Bb (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (50%)\n\nSo phenotypes: BB (black), Bb (black), bb (white). Ratio 3:1.\n\nSimilarly, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Same reasoning: BB can only give B, Bb can give B or b. So same result: 3:1.\n\nBut in the initial consideration, I thought that Bb \u00d7 Bb would also produce a 3:1. So why are options G and H correct? Or did I misunderstand the options?\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\n\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\n\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\n\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo options G and H are both Bb \u00d7 BB and BB \u00d7 Bb respectively. They both produce 3:1 ratio.\n\nBut wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me think about the actual cross outcomes.\n\nIn a Bb \u00d7 Bb cross, each parent can produce B or b gametes. The Punnett square is:\n\n   | B | b\n---|---|---\nB | BB | Bb\nb | Bb | bb\n\nSo the phenotypes are:\n\n- BB: black (25%)\n- Bb: black (50%)\n- bb: white (25%)\n\nTotal: 3:1.\n\nIn a Bb \u00d7 BB cross, the Bb parent can produce B or b, while BB can only produce B.\n\nSo the Punnett square becomes:\n\n   | B | B\n---|---|---\nB | BB | BB\nb | Bb | Bb\n\nSo the offspring genotypes are:\n\n- BB (50%)\n- Bb (50%)\n\nPhenotypes: BB and Bb are black, so 100% black and 0% white. That's a 1:0 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOh! Wait, that's a key point. So if one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the ratio is 1:0 instead of 3:1. Because the Bb parent can produce B or b, but the BB parent can only produce B. Therefore, the offspring will always have at least one B, making all of them either BB or Bb, hence all black. That contradicts the problem statement which says 3/4 black and 1/4 white.\n\nTherefore, the correct parents must be both Bb \u00d7 Bb, resulting in 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but let me confirm once more. If one parent is Bb and the other is BB, the children would have:\n\nAll offspring inherit B from the BB parent. The Bb parent can pass either B or b.\n\nSo the possible genotypes are:\n\n- BB (from Bb and BB)\n- Bb (from Bb and BB)\n\nBoth are black. So the ratio is 100%, not 3:1. Therefore, parents cannot be Bb \u00d7 BB. Thus, the only way to get 3:1 is if both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nAlternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, then the cross would be Bb \u00d7 bb, which would yield Bb (which is black) and bb (white), giving a 1:1 ratio, which doesn't fit the problem statement.\n\nSo going back to the original options, the only pair that leads to a 3:1 ratio is when both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb (option G) or when one parent is Bb and the other is BB (but that doesn't work, as shown above). Wait, no\u2014it worked when the parents are both Bb \u00d7 Bb (G) and also when one parent is Bb and the other is BB (H), but H doesn't work because it gives 1:0 ratio.\n\nWait, now I'm confused because earlier I thought that option G (Bb \u00d7 Bb) and option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) both produce 3:1, but upon closer inspection, option H doesn't. Because when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring are all B, so 100% black, not 3:1.\n\nSo only option G, where both parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, would produce a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, the correct answer is G.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Maybe I got the cross wrong. Let me consider each option:\n\nOption A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption B: BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 mixed crosses, probably not relevant as the problem states both parents.\n\nOption C: bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 1:3 ratio (only bb and Bb \u2192 25% and 75%?)\n\nNo, wait: bb (25%) and Bb (50%) \u2192 phenotypes: 25% white, 50% black. So 1:2 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 100% white \u2192 no.\n\nOption E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2192 25% bb (white), 75% BB (black) \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2192 similar to E: 75% black, 25% white \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2192 1:0 \u2192 no.\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2192 same as E: 75% black, 25% white \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2192 75% BB, 25% bb \u2192 3:1 \u2714\ufe0f\n\nSo options A, E, F, I, J produce 3:1. Options B, C, D, H produce less. Option G also produces 3:1.\n\nBut the question asks for the most likely genotype, meaning the cross that would produce 3:1. So multiple options could theoretically produce 3:1, but perhaps the intended answer is G (Bb \u00d7 Bb).\n\nWait, but in reality, both G and H produce 3:1. Let me see if I made an error in evaluating H.\n\nH is BB \u00d7 Bb. As I analyzed before, the offspring would all have at least one B allele, so all black, thus 100% black. Therefore, H doesn't match the 3:1 ratio required in the problem.\n\nSo the only options that produce 3:1 are A, E, F, I, J, and G. But among those, the most straightforward answer is G, which is Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n\nWait, but looking back, I initially thought that G and H are both possible, but H doesn't fit. So the correct answer is G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

But wait, no\u2014the parents here may not necessarily be heterozygotes because sometimes they could be homozygous.

Wait, no, let me check:\n\nOption G: Bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 yes, both parents are Bb and BB respectively.\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2013 both parents are Bb and BB respectively?\n\nWait, no, let me clarify.

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option H says BB \u00d7 Bb, which might be another possible pair. But I think the way the parents are described in some cases can affect the outcome. Since both parents are guinea pigs with black coats, their possible genotypes must allow for the appearance of the dominant trait. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, since the phenotype is black (dominant) and white (recessive), the genotype possibilities for each parent could be either homozygous dominant (BB) or heterozygous (Bb). Because if they were homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning all white, which doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. Therefore, the parents cannot both be homozygous recessive because that would make all the children white, which contradicts the observed data. So, any parent being bb is invalid here because it leads to an impossible outcome. Therefore, both parents must be heterozygous, Bb \u00d7 Bb, because that allows for the possibility of both alleles showing up in the offspring.\n\nNow, considering that, when you cross two Bb parents, what happens? Let's outline the Punnett square for that:\n\nParent 1: B b  \nParent 2: B b  \n\nThe possible gametes from each parent are B and b, each with equal probability. So, when they combine, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from first parent) + B (from second parent) = BB  \n- B (first) + b (second) = Bb  \n- b (first) + B (second) = Bb  \n- b (first) + b (second) = bb  \n\nSo, the phenotypes will be:\n- BB \u2192 Black  \n- Bb \u2192 Black  \n- bb \u2192 White  \n\nTherefore, the ratios would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white, which matches exactly what was observed in the problem. Now, looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which aligns perfectly with this analysis. Let me double-check why the other options don't work.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2013 as discussed earlier, this would lead to all white offspring, which doesn't match the \u00be black ratio. Similarly, option C: bb \u00d7 Bb would also result in all white since the bb parent would always pass on b, leading to all offspring being bb, hence all white.

BB \u00d7 BB\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to solve this genetics problem about guinea pigs. Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nWait, actually, option H says BB \u00d7 Bb, which might be another possible pair. But I think the way the parents are described in some cases can affect the outcome. Since both parents are guinea pigs with black coats, their possible genotypes must allow for the appearance of the dominant trait. Let's consider each possibility.\n\nFirst, since the phenotype is black (dominant) and white (recessive), the genotype possibilities for each parent could be either homozygous dominant (BB) or heterozygous (Bb). Because if they were homozygous recessive (bb), then all offspring would be bb, meaning all white, which doesn't fit the \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. Therefore, the parents cannot both be homozygous recessive because that would make all the children white, which contradicts the observed data. So, any parent being bb is invalid here because it leads to an impossible outcome. Therefore, both parents must be heterozygous, Bb \u00d7 Bb, because that allows for the possibility of both alleles showing up in the offspring.\n\nNow, considering that, when you cross two Bb parents, what happens? Let's outline the Punnett square for that:\n\nParent 1: B b  \nParent 2: B b  \n\nThe possible gametes from each parent are B and b, each with equal probability. So, when they combine, the possible offspring genotypes are:\n\n- B (from first parent) + B (from second parent) = BB  \n- B (first) + b (second) = Bb  \n- b (first) + B (second) = Bb  \n- b (first) + b (second) = bb  \n\nSo, the phenotypes will be:\n- BB \u2192 Black  \n- Bb \u2192 Black  \n- bb \u2192 White  \n\nTherefore, the ratios would be 3/4 black and 1/4 white, which matches exactly what was observed in the problem. Now, looking back at the options, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which aligns perfectly with this analysis. Let me double-check why the other options don't work.\n\nOption D: bb \u00d7 bb \u2013 as discussed earlier, this would lead to all white offspring, which doesn't match the \u00be black ratio. Similarly, option C: bb \u00d7 Bb would also result in all white since the bb parent would always pass on b, leading to all offspring being bb, hence all white. Option E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 same thing; bb would produce bb offspring, all white. Option F: Bb \u00d7 bb \u2013 same issue as above, all white. Option I: BB \u00d7 bb \u2013 same reasoning. Option H: BB \u00d7 Bb \u2013 that's similar to option G. Wait, no\u2014the parents are both Bb, so that's G. Option J: BB \u00d7 BB \u2013 that would result in all BB offspring, all black, which is 100% black, not matching the \u00be black ratio. Option A: Bb \u00d7 Bb \u2013 yes, that's what we've concluded. Options B, C, D, etc., involve at least one parent who is bb, which would result in all offspring being bb, hence all white, which doesn't fit the data. Option E: bb \u00d7 BB \u2013 same issue. So the only viable option is G: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to figure out what genotype combinations would produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. Let's think about what possible combinations exist. If the parents are homozygous (both alleles same), like BB \u00d7 BB, then all offspring will be BB, so all black. That wouldn't give any white coats, so option D or E might not fit since they don't explain the 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if they were homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb), all would be bb, all white. So options F, G, H, J also can't explain 3:1 unless there's an heterozygote involved.\n\nSo probably, the parents must be a mix\u2014some heterozygotes. Now, considering that the offspring are \u00be black and \u00bc white, the possible combinations for the parents are where one parent is homozygous dominant (B_) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), because then their offspring would show a \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. Alternatively, another possibility is that both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio when crossed, but here the ratio is 3:1, so maybe it's simpler than that.\n\nWait, but in the case of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the expected ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1 because each parent can contribute either B or b. But in this problem, the ratio is 3:1. So perhaps the parents are one homozygous dominant (BB) and one heterozygous (Bb), meaning the cross would be BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: BB produces all B alleles, and Bb produces a 50% B and 50% b. When you combine them, half of the offspring will get B from the BB parent and B from the Bb parent, making BB (and thus black). The other half will get B from the BB parent and b from the Bb parent, making Bb (so still black, as B is dominant). Wait no, wait\u2014if the parents are BB and Bb, then the gametes from BB are all B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring will receive B from BB and B/b from Bb. So all offspring will be BB or Bb, both of which are black. That would give a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't match the problem statement. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the parents. Let me think again. The problem states that both parents have black coats. So their genotypes could be either BB, Bb, or Bb (since Bb and BB both express black). We're told that the cross results in \u00be black and \u00bc white. So perhaps one parent is BB (always black) and the other is Bb. As I thought earlier, that would make all offspring black. No, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, their offspring would have a 25% chance of being bb (white) and 75% BB or Bb (black). So the ratio would be 3:1, which matches the problem. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. But wait, looking back at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So that would make sense. Let me confirm:\n\nCrossing Bb \u00d7 Bb:\nEach parent can contribute B or b.\nGametes: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nPhenotype ratios: BB and Bb = black; bb = white.\nThus, 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem. So the correct answer should be parents who are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which seems incorrect based on our reasoning. Wait, no\u2014the parents in this case would actually be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option H. But in the options provided, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\", which I just realized was a typo because BB \u00d7 Bb is not a standard notation. Wait, no\u2014the original options say:\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nYes, so if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, then the cross would yield 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Thus, 75% black, 25% white. So that would result in the desired ratio. So why did I initially think it was Bb \u00d7 Bb?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me re-express this.\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then all offspring will have a 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem. However, according to the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So is that correct? Or am I missing something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me check the options again. Option H says \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". So yes, that's correct. So the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 3:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option H. However, looking back, the options list option H as \"BB \u00d7 Bb\" and others include BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, etc. So if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, then the answer is H. But let me check whether any other options could also lead to the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see: Bb \u00d7 bb would result in offspring with 25% Bb, 25% bb, 25% bb, 25% bb. So Bb would be black, and bb would be white. Thus, the ratio would be 75% black, 25% white, which matches the problem. So both option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) could theoretically produce a 3:1 ratio. But the question is about the genotypes of the parents. So in the case of option F, one parent is Bb and the other is bb. So the parents are Bb (heterozygous) and bb (homozygous recessive). So their offspring would have a 3:1 ratio as well. So both options F and H could be correct, depending on the parents' genotypes. But in reality, the actual outcome depends on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, but the problem asks which is the most likely genotype pair. So perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is more straightforward. Alternatively, Bb \u00d7 bb would also work. But the question is about the most likely, implying that among the options, which one is correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Both could produce a 3:1 ratio. So perhaps the answer is either H or F. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of the following is the most likely genotype pair. So perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option H. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, it's option F.\n\nBut in reality, the actual genotypes depend on whether the parents are homozygous or heterozygous. Since the question gives us the cross between two guinea pigs, both black, and the expected ratio, I need to determine which of the parent pairs can produce such a ratio.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the phenotypic ratio. The parents' phenotypes are both black, but some offspring are white. To achieve a 3:1 ratio, one parent must carry the recessive allele (b), while the other does not. Because if one parent is bb (homozygous recessive), all its gametes are b. If the other parent is Bb, it can produce B and b. So when crossed, the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb parent: 50% B, 50% b.\n- From bb parent: all b.\n\nSo the offspring would inherit either B (from Bb) + b (from bb) \u2192 Bb (black) or b (from Bb) + b (from bb) \u2192 bb (white).\n\nThus, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, which is 50% each. But wait, the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white, so 3:1. So that approach doesn't fit. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me redo this. Suppose one parent is Bb (heterozygous) and the other is BB (homozygous dominant). Then the gametes from Bb would be 50% B and 50% b, and from BB, all B. So the offspring would receive either B (from BB) and B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black) or B (from BB) and b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black). Thus, all offspring would be black, which is 100%, not 3:1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nNow, suppose one parent is Bb and the other is Bb. Then each parent can produce B or b. The Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotypes: BB and Bb are black; bb is white. So 3:1 ratio. That works.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. So looking at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So that would be 3:1, as needed. So the correct answer is option H.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would also produce a 3:1 ratio. Let me double-check. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the gametes from Bb are 50% B and 50% b, and from bb, all b. So the offspring would have Bb (B from Bb and b from bb) \u2192 black; or bb (b from Bb and b from bb) \u2192 white. So 50% black, 50% white. That's a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So option F is incorrect.\n\nSo going back, the correct parents are those that produce a 3:1 ratio. Which means one parent must be Bb and the other must be Bb. So among the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is incorrect because both parents cannot be Bb if one is BB. Wait, no\u2014it's not necessarily that one parent is BB and the other is Bb. For example, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), their cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So that's a 3:1 ratio. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb, which would be option I, which is BB \u00d7 bb. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, their cross would produce:\n\nFrom BB: all B.\n\nFrom Bb: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSo the offspring would have:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from Bb) \u2192 bb (white)\n\nWait, that's four outcomes:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So phenotypes: 75% black, 25% white. That's a 3:1 ratio. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb, which is option I. But earlier I thought option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would do the same thing. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the previous analysis, I thought that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. That's exactly the same as when one parent is BB and the other is Bb. So in that case, the correct answer is option I, which is BB \u00d7 bb? Wait, no, because when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So the 3:1 ratio comes from the fact that the Bb from the Bb parent combines with B from the BB parent to form BB or Bb, both black. And the bb from the Bb parent forms white. So the ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut now I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier, I thought that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce a 3:1 ratio, but upon recounting, option I (BB \u00d7 Bb) would also produce a 3:1 ratio, whereas option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would produce 1:1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the confusion arises because when both parents are Bb, the cross produces 3:1 ratio. When one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross also produces 3:1 ratio. So which parents are listed in the options?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB\n\nOption K: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption L: Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption M: bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption N: bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption O: bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption P: bb \u00d7 BB\n\nOption Q: BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014the user presented the options as A to J, but the system showed more. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo among these, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, option I is BB \u00d7 bb, etc.\n\nIn the analysis, I saw that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 3:1 ratio. Also, option I (BB \u00d7 bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So same ratio. Whereas option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would produce 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), giving a 1:1 ratio. Similarly, option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) is similar to F, giving 1:1. Option B includes two separate crosses, which might complicate things. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is same as H. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which gives 100% white. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as H. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which gives 100% black. Option M is bb \u00d7 Bb, same as F. Option N is bb \u00d7 bb, same as D. Option O is bb \u00d7 BB, same as E. Option P is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as H. Option Q is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as H.\n\nSo among these, option H and option I both produce a 3:1 ratio, but option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So the parents would be BB and bb, producing 3:1. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would also produce 3:1. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1, as explained before. Same with if one parent is BB and the other is bb. So both scenarios would result in a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is about the genotypes of the parents, not the possible outcomes. So both BB \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. But in reality, when you cross a heterozygote (Bb) with another heterozygote (Bb), you get a 3:1 ratio. When you cross a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb), you also get a 3:1 ratio. So which of these options is correct?\n\nThe question is asking which pair of parents would result in a 3:1 ratio. Both H and I produce a 3:1 ratio. But perhaps the intended answer is option H because it's more common to refer to a homozygous dominant and a heterozygous parent, but technically, both are correct. However, in the context of the question, the most accurate representation would be option H: BB \u00d7 Bb, because it involves a homozygous dominant (BB) and a heterozygote (Bb), which is a typical setup for a 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is BB (always black) and the other is Bb (half black, half white), the cross would produce:\n\n- From BB: all B\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the offspring would have:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from BB) \u2192 bb (white)\n\nSo all except the last 25% would be black, resulting in a 75% black and 25% white ratio. So that's a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, option I (BB \u00d7 bb) would also result in a 3:1 ratio because the offspring would be:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhich is 75% black and 25% white. So both H and I produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is about the genotype of the parents. So if the parents are BB and Bb, that's option H, and if they're BB and bb, that's option I.\n\nGiven that the options are presented as A to J, and the user lists the options as:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\nJ.

However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair, so perhaps the intended answer is H because it's more commonly represented as a homozygous dominant and a heterozygous parent, but technically, both are valid. But in the context of the question, perhaps H is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Let me read through it again carefully. The scenario is that a scientist crossed two guinea pigs, both with black coats. Black hair is dominant over white, so we know that the dominant trait (black) is expressed, and the recessive trait (white) isn't visible in the presence of the dominant version. The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios. Let me break down what I remember from Mendelian genetics. Since the coat color is determined by one gene, and it's a dominance situation, each parent contributes either the dominant or recessive allele for that gene. Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio. In terms of probabilities, this could mean that each offspring has a 75% chance of having at least one dominant allele (black), and a 25% chance of having none (all recessives, white). So, if we're looking at dihybrid crosses or other combinations, how do the parents' genotypes look? The options given are A to J, but let me list them: \n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb  \nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb  \nC. bb \u00d7 Bb  \nD. bb \u00d7 bb  \nE. bb \u00d7 BB  \nF. Bb \u00d7 bb  \nG. Bb \u00d7 BB  \nH. BB \u00d7 Bb  \nI. BB \u00d7 bb  \nJ. BB \u00d7 BB  \n\nHmm, okay. First, I need to figure out what genotype combinations would produce a 3:1 phenotypic ratio when crossed. Let's think about what possible combinations exist. If the parents are homozygous (both alleles same), like BB \u00d7 BB, then all offspring will be BB, so all black. That wouldn't give any white coats, so option D or E might not fit since they don't explain the 3:1 ratio. Similarly, if they were homozygous recessive (bb \u00d7 bb), all would be bb, all white. So options F, G, H, J also can't explain 3:1 unless there's an heterozygote involved.\n\nSo probably, the parents must be a mix\u2014some heterozygotes. Now, considering that the offspring are \u00be black and \u00bc white, the possible combinations for the parents are where one parent is homozygous dominant (B_) and the other is heterozygous (Bb), because then their offspring would show a \u00be black and \u00bc white ratio. Alternatively, another possibility is that both parents are heterozygous (Bb \u00d7 Bb), leading to a 9:3:3:1 ratio when crossed, but here the ratio is 3:1, so maybe it's simpler than that.\n\nWait, but in the case of Bb \u00d7 Bb, the expected ratio is indeed 9:3:3:1 because each parent can contribute either B or b. But in this problem, the ratio is 3:1. So perhaps the parents are one homozygous dominant (BB) and one heterozygous (Bb), meaning the cross would be BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see: BB produces all B alleles, and Bb produces a 50% B and 50% b. When you combine them, half of the offspring will get B from the BB parent and B from the Bb parent, making BB (and thus black). The other half will get B from the BB parent and b from the Bb parent, making Bb (so still black, as B is dominant). Wait no, wait\u2014if the parents are BB and Bb, then the gametes from BB are all B, and from Bb are B and b. So the offspring will receive B from BB and B/b from Bb. So all offspring will be BB or Bb, both of which are black. That would give a 100% black phenotype, which doesn't match the problem statement. So that can't be right.\n\nWait, maybe I mixed up the parents. Let me think again. The problem states that both parents have black coats. So their genotypes could be either BB, Bb, or Bb (since Bb and BB both express black). We're told that the cross results in \u00be black and \u00bc white. So perhaps one parent is BB (always black) and the other is Bb. As I thought earlier, that would make all offspring black. No, that's not matching. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, if both parents are Bb, their offspring would have a 25% chance of being bb (white) and 75% BB or Bb (black). So the ratio would be 3:1, which matches the problem. Therefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. But wait, looking back at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So that would make sense. Let me confirm:\n\nCrossing Bb \u00d7 Bb:\nEach parent can contribute B or b.\nGametes: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nPossible offspring genotypes:\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), Bb (50%), bb (25%).\n\nPhenotype ratios: BB and Bb = black; bb = white.\nThus, 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem. So the correct answer should be parents who are Bb \u00d7 Bb. Looking at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which seems incorrect based on our reasoning. Wait, no\u2014the parents in this case would actually be Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option H. But in the options provided, option H is \"BB \u00d7 Bb\", which I just realized was a typo because BB \u00d7 Bb is not a standard notation. Wait, no\u2014the original options say:\n\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nYes, so if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, then the cross would yield 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Thus, 75% black, 25% white. So that would result in the desired ratio. So why did I initially think it was Bb \u00d7 Bb?\n\nAh, perhaps I made a mistake in my initial assumption. Let me re-express this.\n\nIf the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, then all offspring will have a 3:1 ratio, which fits the problem. However, according to the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. So is that correct? Or am I missing something else?\n\nWait, perhaps I'm mixing up the letters. Let me check the options again. Option H says \"BB \u00d7 Bb\". So yes, that's correct. So the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce a 3:1 ratio. So the correct answer should be option H. However, looking back, the options list option H as \"BB \u00d7 Bb\" and others include BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb, etc. So if the parents are BB \u00d7 Bb, then the answer is H. But let me check whether any other options could also lead to the 3:1 ratio.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Let's see: Bb \u00d7 bb would result in offspring with 25% Bb, 25% bb, 25% bb, 25% bb. So Bb would be black, and bb would be white. Thus, the ratio would be 75% black, 25% white, which matches the problem. So both option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) and option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) could theoretically produce a 3:1 ratio. But the question is about the genotypes of the parents. So in the case of option F, one parent is Bb and the other is bb. So the parents are Bb (heterozygous) and bb (homozygous recessive). So their offspring would have a 3:1 ratio as well. So both options F and H could be correct, depending on the parents' genotypes. But in reality, the actual outcome depends on the parents' genotypes.\n\nWait, but the problem asks which is the most likely genotype pair. So perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is more straightforward. Alternatively, Bb \u00d7 bb would also work. But the question is about the most likely, implying that among the options, which one is correct.\n\nLooking back at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, and option F is Bb \u00d7 bb. Both could produce a 3:1 ratio. So perhaps the answer is either H or F. However, the way the question is phrased, it's asking which of the following is the most likely genotype pair. So perhaps the parents are Bb \u00d7 Bb, which is option H. Alternatively, if one parent is Bb and the other is bb, it's option F.\n\nBut in reality, the actual genotypes depend on whether the parents are homozygous or heterozygous. Since the question gives us the cross between two guinea pigs, both black, and the expected ratio, I need to determine which of the parent pairs can produce such a ratio.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the phenotypic ratio. The parents' phenotypes are both black, but some offspring are white. To achieve a 3:1 ratio, one parent must carry the recessive allele (b), while the other does not. Because if one parent is bb (homozygous recessive), all its gametes are b. If the other parent is Bb, it can produce B and b. So when crossed, the offspring would be:\n\n- From Bb parent: 50% B, 50% b.\n- From bb parent: all b.\n\nSo the offspring would inherit either B (from Bb) + b (from bb) \u2192 Bb (black) or b (from Bb) + b (from bb) \u2192 bb (white).\n\nThus, 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white). That gives a 1:1 ratio, which is 50% each. But wait, the problem states \u00be black and \u00bc white, so 3:1. So that approach doesn't fit. Wait, so perhaps I made a mistake earlier.\n\nLet me redo this. Suppose one parent is Bb (heterozygous) and the other is BB (homozygous dominant). Then the gametes from Bb would be 50% B and 50% b, and from BB, all B. So the offspring would receive either B (from BB) and B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black) or B (from BB) and b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black). Thus, all offspring would be black, which is 100%, not 3:1. So that doesn't fit.\n\nNow, suppose one parent is Bb and the other is Bb. Then each parent can produce B or b. The Punnett square would show 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. Phenotypes: BB and Bb are black; bb is white. So 3:1 ratio. That works.\n\nTherefore, the parents must be Bb \u00d7 Bb. So looking at the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So that would be 3:1, as needed. So the correct answer is option H.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought that option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would also produce a 3:1 ratio. Let me double-check. If one parent is Bb and the other is bb, the gametes from Bb are 50% B and 50% b, and from bb, all b. So the offspring would have Bb (B from Bb and b from bb) \u2192 black; or bb (b from Bb and b from bb) \u2192 white. So 50% black, 50% white. That's a 1:1 ratio, not 3:1. So option F is incorrect.\n\nSo going back, the correct parents are those that produce a 3:1 ratio. Which means one parent must be Bb and the other must be Bb. So among the options, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is incorrect because both parents cannot be Bb if one is BB. Wait, no\u2014it's not necessarily that one parent is BB and the other is Bb. For example, if one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), their cross would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So that's a 3:1 ratio. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb, which would be option I, which is BB \u00d7 bb. Wait, no\u2014I'm getting confused now.\n\nWait, let's clarify. If one parent is BB and the other is Bb, their cross would produce:\n\nFrom BB: all B.\n\nFrom Bb: 50% B, 50% b.\n\nSo the offspring would have:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from Bb) \u2192 bb (white)\n\nWait, that's four outcomes:\n\nBB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%). So phenotypes: 75% black, 25% white. That's a 3:1 ratio. So in this case, the parents are BB and Bb, which is option I. But earlier I thought option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would do the same thing. So perhaps I made a mistake in counting.\n\nWait, in the previous analysis, I thought that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. That's exactly the same as when one parent is BB and the other is Bb. So in that case, the correct answer is option I, which is BB \u00d7 bb? Wait, no, because when one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the offspring would be 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So the 3:1 ratio comes from the fact that the Bb from the Bb parent combines with B from the BB parent to form BB or Bb, both black. And the bb from the Bb parent forms white. So the ratio is 3:1.\n\nBut now I'm getting conflicting conclusions. Earlier, I thought that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce a 3:1 ratio, but upon recounting, option I (BB \u00d7 Bb) would also produce a 3:1 ratio, whereas option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would produce 1:1.\n\nWait, no\u2014the confusion arises because when both parents are Bb, the cross produces 3:1 ratio. When one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the cross also produces 3:1 ratio. So which parents are listed in the options?\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nOption H: BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption I: BB \u00d7 bb\n\nOption J: BB \u00d7 BB\n\nOption K: Bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption L: Bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption M: bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption N: bb \u00d7 bb\n\nOption O: bb \u00d7 Bb\n\nOption P: bb \u00d7 BB\n\nOption Q: BB \u00d7 Bb\n\nWait, no\u2014the user presented the options as A to J, but the system showed more. Wait, the user wrote:\n\nOptions:\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo among these, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, option I is BB \u00d7 bb, etc.\n\nIn the analysis, I saw that option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So 3:1 ratio. Also, option I (BB \u00d7 bb) would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So same ratio. Whereas option F (Bb \u00d7 bb) would produce 50% Bb (black) and 50% bb (white), giving a 1:1 ratio. Similarly, option C (bb \u00d7 Bb) is similar to F, giving 1:1. Option B includes two separate crosses, which might complicate things. Option G is Bb \u00d7 BB, which is same as H. Option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which gives 100% white. Option E is bb \u00d7 BB, same as H. Option J is BB \u00d7 BB, which gives 100% black. Option M is bb \u00d7 Bb, same as F. Option N is bb \u00d7 bb, same as D. Option O is bb \u00d7 BB, same as E. Option P is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as H. Option Q is BB \u00d7 Bb, same as H.\n\nSo among these, option H and option I both produce a 3:1 ratio, but option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which would produce 25% BB, 50% Bb, 25% bb. So the parents would be BB and bb, producing 3:1. Option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which would also produce 3:1. So which one is correct?\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is BB and the other is Bb, the expected phenotypic ratio is 3:1, as explained before. Same with if one parent is BB and the other is bb. So both scenarios would result in a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is about the genotypes of the parents, not the possible outcomes. So both BB \u00d7 Bb and BB \u00d7 bb would produce a 3:1 ratio. But in reality, when you cross a heterozygote (Bb) with another heterozygote (Bb), you get a 3:1 ratio. When you cross a homozygous dominant (BB) with a heterozygote (Bb), you also get a 3:1 ratio. So which of these options is correct?\n\nThe question is asking which pair of parents would result in a 3:1 ratio. Both H and I produce a 3:1 ratio. But perhaps the intended answer is option H because it's more common to refer to a homozygous dominant and a heterozygous parent, but technically, both are correct. However, in the context of the question, the most accurate representation would be option H: BB \u00d7 Bb, because it involves a homozygous dominant (BB) and a heterozygote (Bb), which is a typical setup for a 3:1 ratio.\n\nWait, but in reality, if one parent is BB (always black) and the other is Bb (half black, half white), the cross would produce:\n\n- From BB: all B\n- From Bb: 50% B, 50% b\n\nSo the offspring would have:\n\n- B (from BB) + B (from Bb) \u2192 BB (black)\n- B (from BB) + b (from Bb) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + B (from BB) \u2192 Bb (black)\n- b (from Bb) + b (from BB) \u2192 bb (white)\n\nSo all except the last 25% would be black, resulting in a 75% black and 25% white ratio. So that's a 3:1 ratio. Therefore, option H (BB \u00d7 Bb) is correct.\n\nSimilarly, option I (BB \u00d7 bb) would also result in a 3:1 ratio because the offspring would be:\n\n- BB (25%), Bb (50%), bb (25%)\n\nWhich is 75% black and 25% white. So both H and I produce a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is about the genotype of the parents. So if the parents are BB and Bb, that's option H, and if they're BB and bb, that's option I.\n\nGiven that the options are presented as A to J, and the user lists the options as:\n\nA. Bb \u00d7 Bb\nB. BB \u00d7 BB and Bb \u00d7 bb\nC. bb \u00d7 Bb\nD. bb \u00d7 bb\nE. bb \u00d7 BB\nF. Bb \u00d7 bb\nG. Bb \u00d7 BB\nH. BB \u00d7 Bb\nI. BB \u00d7 bb\nJ. BB \u00d7 BB\n\nSo among these, option H is BB \u00d7 Bb, which is correct because it would produce a 3:1 ratio. Option I is BB \u00d7 bb, which also produces a 3:1 ratio. However, the question is about the most likely genotype pair, so perhaps the intended answer is H because it's more commonly represented as a homozygous dominant and a heterozygous parent, but technically, both are valid. But in the context of the question, perhaps H is the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

The offspring's traits are \u00be black and \u00bc white. The question is asking about the genotypes of the parents, specifically which combination would result in these offspring ratios.

Given that all three-quarters of the offspring have black coats and one-quarter has white, that suggests a 3:1 ratio.

That seems like an example where one parent is heterozygous (Bb) and the other is homozygous recessive (bb). This would lead to a 1:1 ratio because all the offspring would be Bb (since the other parent can't contribute b), resulting in all showing the dominant trait. But here, the ratio is 3:1, not 1:1. So maybe option F isn't correct.\n\nLet me think more systematically. If the ratio is 3:1, then the parents must produce gametes in a way that when they combine, half the time they give a dominant allele (resulting in black) and half the time recessive (resulting in white). Alternatively, it might involve some sort of blending of alleles, but since we're dealing with dominant-recessive ratios, it should be straightforward.\n\nSince the parents are crossing and producing \u00be black and \u00bc white, perhaps each parent gives a certain combination. Let's consider possible parents:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are Bb. Then each parent can produce B or b gametes. The Punnett square would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So the ratio would be 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb, leading to 3/4 black and 1/4 white. That fits the given ratio. So if both parents are Bb, their offspring would have a 3:1 ratio, as required. Therefore, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems promising.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Let's see. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the possible gametes are B from the first parent and B/b from the second. So the offspring would get either BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Since B is dominant, all offspring would express the dominant trait (black). That would result in a 1:0 ratio, which doesn't fit our 3:1 ratio. So that's not right.\n\nAnother case: One parent is BB and the other is bb. Then the offspring would always receive B from the BB parent and b from the bb parent, making all Bb individuals. Again, 100% black, which doesn't match.\n\nWhat about one parent being BB and the other Bb? As above, same issue\u2014offspring are Bb, so 100% black.\n\nAlternatively, both parents being BB would definitely result in all Bb offspring, no blacks. Not relevant here.\n\nNow, considering the other cases. For instance, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, as in option G, the Punnett square shows \u00be BB and \u00bc bb, which results in \u00be B (black) and \u00bc b (white). Perfect. So this matches the observed ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would yield 25% Bb and 75% bb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the opposite; if one parent is bb (homozygous recessive) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be Bb (25%) and bb (75%). So the phenotype would be 25% B (black) and 75% b (white). That\u2019s 1:3 ratio, which is different from 3:1. So option C wouldn\u2019t fit.\n\nSimilarly, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all bb offspring, meaning 100% white coat. Not matching.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option C, this would produce 25% Bb and 75% bb, resulting in 25% B and 75% b. Again, 1:3 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. As discussed earlier, this would result in 25% B and 75% b, not 3:1.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see, the Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent can only give B. So the offspring would be 50% BB (B) and 50% Bb (B). So all would be B, meaning 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Same as H, all offspring would be Bb, so 100% B. Not matching.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so 100% B.

Alternatively, it might involve some sort of blending of alleles, but since we're dealing with dominant-recessive ratios, it should be straightforward.\n\nSince the parents are crossing and producing \u00be black and \u00bc white, perhaps each parent gives a certain combination. Let's consider possible parents:\n\nCase 1: Both parents are Bb. Then each parent can produce B or b gametes. The Punnett square would show four possibilities: BB (25%), Bb (50%), and bb (25%). So the ratio would be 3/4 Bb and 1/4 bb, leading to 3/4 black and 1/4 white. That fits the given ratio. So if both parents are Bb, their offspring would have a 3:1 ratio, as required. Therefore, option G is Bb \u00d7 Bb, which seems promising.\n\nBut wait, another possibility is that one parent is BB and the other is Bb. Let's see. If one parent is BB (homozygous dominant) and the other is Bb (heterozygous), then the possible gametes are B from the first parent and B/b from the second. So the offspring would get either BB (from B and B) or Bb (from B and b). Since B is dominant, all offspring would express the dominant trait (black). That would result in a 1:0 ratio, which doesn't fit our 3:1 ratio. So that's not right.\n\nAnother case: One parent is BB and the other is bb. Then the offspring would always receive B from the BB parent and b from the bb parent, making all Bb individuals. Again, 100% black, which doesn't match.\n\nWhat about one parent being BB and the other Bb? As above, same issue\u2014offspring are Bb, so 100% black.\n\nAlternatively, both parents being BB would definitely result in all Bb offspring, no blacks. Not relevant here.\n\nNow, considering the other cases. For instance, if one parent is Bb and the other is Bb, as in option G, the Punnett square shows \u00be BB and \u00bc bb, which results in \u00be B (black) and \u00bc b (white). Perfect. So this matches the observed ratio.\n\nLooking back at the options, G is Bb \u00d7 Bb. Option C is bb \u00d7 Bb, which would yield 25% Bb and 75% bb. Wait, no\u2014that\u2019s the opposite; if one parent is bb (homozygous recessive) and the other is Bb, then the offspring would be Bb (25%) and bb (75%). So the phenotype would be 25% B (black) and 75% b (white). That\u2019s 1:3 ratio, which is different from 3:1. So option C wouldn\u2019t fit.\n\nSimilarly, option D is bb \u00d7 bb, which would produce all bb offspring, meaning 100% white coat. Not matching.\n\nOption E is bb \u00d7 BB. Similar to option C, this would produce 25% Bb and 75% bb, resulting in 25% B and 75% b. Again, 1:3 ratio, not 3:1.\n\nOption F is Bb \u00d7 bb. As discussed earlier, this would result in 25% B and 75% b, not 3:1.\n\nOption H is BB \u00d7 Bb. Let's see, the Bb parent can give B or b, and the BB parent can only give B. So the offspring would be 50% BB (B) and 50% Bb (B). So all would be B, meaning 100% black. Not matching.\n\nOption I is BB \u00d7 bb. Same as H, all offspring would be Bb, so 100% B. Not matching.\n\nOption J is BB \u00d7 BB. All offspring would be BB, so 100% B. Also not matching.\n\nSo the only option that produces a 3:1 ratio is option G: Bb \u00d7 Bb.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
