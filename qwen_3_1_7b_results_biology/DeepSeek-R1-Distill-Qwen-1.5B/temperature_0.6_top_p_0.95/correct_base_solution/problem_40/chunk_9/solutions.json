Option E claims glucose is solely used for energy. While that's true for animals, plants also use glucose for photosynthesis, so E is too narrow. Option F says glucose can be directly converted into protein. That doesn't align with what I know since proteins are synthesized from amino acids, which requires glucose, but the conversion itself might not happen immediately. Option G states glucose cannot be stored in any form. Definitely wrong because cells do use glucose for various purposes beyond just being a fuel. Option H claims glucose is used to make nucleic acids exclusively. That's not correct either because nucleic acids are made via rRNA and tRNA, not glucose.

This makes no sense because cells function without glucose, and even when present, they're often in small amounts. Structural components refer to parts of cells, not the substance itself.\n\nFinally, Option J mentions that glucose is not involved in cell metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. This is completely false since glucose is a key player in cellular energy and biosynthesis pathways, and it's abundant enough to serve as a food source.\n\nAfter reviewing each option, the most accurate statement aligns with what I know about glucose's role in cell metabolism. It's involved in both energy production and storage, and there are specific ways it's utilized in different processes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this question about glucose's role in cell metabolism. The user has provided a list of options from A to J, each making a statement about how glucose is used or not used in different cellular processes. My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. I think cells use glucose for both energy and other processes, so they shouldn't be limited to fat. Option C suggests glucose is only used in synthesizing amino acids. That's probably incorrect too because amino acids are usually derived from proteins via deamination, which uses glucose. So C is out. Option D states that glucose can be stored only as starch in humans. No, I recall that in animals, glucose is often stored as glycogen, especially after meals when blood sugar levels drop. Starch storage is more common in plants. So D isn't accurate either. Option E says glucose is only used for energy production. While it definitely plays a role in energy, there are other important functions like building muscles (glutathione synthase), transporting oxygen (cytosolic H+ gradient), and even playing a role in aging (nucleotide excision repair). So E oversimplifies things, making it incorrect. Option F claims glucose can convert directly into protein. That would mean bypassing most metabolic steps, which isn't true. Cells still have enzymes for various reductions of glucose to amino acids, then those are further reduced to histidine, etc., before being encoded into proteins. So F is wrong. Option G says glucose can't be stored. No, in humans, glucose is typically stored as glycogen after being mobilized for energy needs. Storing it as starch is rare, especially post-meal. So G is incorrect. Option H suggests glucose is used exclusively for producing nucleic acids. That's not true; nucleic acids are synthesized using amino acids, which come from glucose via deaminases. So H is false. Option I states glucose is only used structurally in cells. No, it's definitely functional. Cells use glucose to fuel processes, build proteins, transport molecules, etc. So I overstates its exclusivity. Finally, Option J says glucose isn't involved but is just a dietary fiber. That's completely wrong because I'm certain glucose is essential for metabolism, and it's abundant in human cells. So J is out. After going through all the options, Option A stands out as the correct answer because it accurately describes glucose's multifaceted role in energy, storage, and synthesis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all.",

    "rollout": " I know that during anabolic processes, cells use glucose for energy and also store it as glycogen before breaking down fat later. So B is incorrect. Option C states that glucose is exclusively used in amino acid synthesis. That doesn't make sense either. Cells require various nutrients besides glucose; amino acids are part of proteins, so this isn't accurate. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in starch form in humans. While carbohydrates like starch are stored in cells, I'm not sure if all stores are starch or if some other form exists too. But I think other forms might exist depending on the cell type. So D might not be entirely correct. Option E says glucose is only used for energy. That's partially true because without enough energy, cells can't grow, but it's also not exclusive. They do use glucose for other purposes like synthesizing amino acids and storing energy. So E is too restrictive. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. Again, I don't recall this being the case. Protein synthesis requires enzymes that break down glucose, but it's more efficient to convert it into glycogen first before using enzymes like amylase. So F is probably incorrect. Option G states that glucose cannot be stored in any form. That doesn't fit because even though some cells store glucose in different forms like starch, others might have other storage mechanisms. So G is incorrect. Option H suggests glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. That's definitely wrong because the process involves multiple steps beyond just producing nucleic acids\u2014enzymes for DNA synthesis, ribosomes, etc. So H is out. Option I says glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. That doesn't align with my knowledge either. Structural components include things like proteins' domains, lipids, etc., but cells also use glucose as an energy source. So I is incorrect. Finally, Option J states that glucose is not involved in cell metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. No, that's completely false. Glucose is crucial for most metabolic processes.

This is true, but it's too narrow because glucose is also utilized for building proteins, producing enzymes, and even in glycolysis for other functions. Option F says glucose can be directly converted into protein. That's partially correct because some pathways convert glucose into amino acids which then become proteins, but it's not exclusive. Option G claims glucose cannot be stored in any form. That's false because cells do store glucose in multiple forms like glycogen and starch. Option H states glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. This is incorrect because nucleic acids aren't produced solely from glucose; they require other nutrients first. Option I says glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. This isn't accurate because glucose itself isn't a structural component; its derivatives are.

My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. Cells can use glucose for various purposes beyond just fat; they're also used for other substances like amino acids, lipids, etc. Option C states that glucose is exclusively used in the synthesis of amino acids. That's definitely incorrect because amino acids are derived from glucose through metabolism, so glucose isn't the sole source there. Option D suggests glucose can only be stored in starch in human cells. While starch is a common way to store glucose, it's not exclusive since cells can metabolize glucose into other forms like glycogen or fatty acids. Option E claims glucose is only used for energy.

Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in the form of starch in human cells. Starch storage is a common way for plants to store glucose, but in animals, it's more common to have glycogen. So D might not be entirely true either. Option E says glucose is only used for energy production. That's incorrect because while it's used for energy, it's also part of other processes like biosynthesis. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. Protein synthesis requires enzymes that consume glucose, so this makes sense. But wait, I should check if it's only directly converted or if other steps are involved. Option G states glucose cannot be stored in any form. This is definitely false because glucose is highly abundant and can be stored in various forms. Option H says glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. This is incorrect because nucleic acid synthesis involves multiple steps and isn't limited solely to glucose.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this question about glucose's role in cell metabolism. The user has provided a list of options from A to J, each making a statement about how glucose is used or not used in different cellular processes. My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. It would mean glucose isn't used for other purposes, which contradicts my understanding. Option C states that glucose is exclusively used in amino acid synthesis. No, I don't think so. Glucose is more versatile; it's used for various reactions, including protein synthesis, glycolysis, etc. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in starch form. That's incorrect because I've heard that other forms like ribose are also possible under certain conditions, though not common. Option E claims glucose is only used for energy. While it's true that gluconeogenesis occurs, it's not exclusive since it's also used in other processes. Option F says glucose can be directly converted into protein. That's accurate because amino acids can be linked via peptide bonds, and some can even be linked via amide bonds if done correctly, leading to proteins without intermediates. Option G states that glucose cannot be stored. Definitely wrong because I know that carbohydrates like glucose are stored in various forms like glycogen, ketoprotein, or starch. Option H claims glucose is used to make nucleic acids exclusively. That's incorrect because nucleic acids are typically synthesized via tRNA-cRNA mechanisms, not directly from glucose. Option I asserts that glucose is only used structurally in cells. No, I'm pretty sure that plays a significant role in cell structure and function. Option J says glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. That's clearly false because I know that the primary metabolic cost of food is glucose. \n\nSo, going back, the most accurate statements seem to be A and F. But wait, the question asks for the roles that glucose plays, implying multiple aspects. Let me reevaluate. Option A covers energy, storage, and conversion into fat, which are key parts of metabolism. Option F is specific about converting glucose into protein, which is another critical aspect. However, looking at the answer choices, they're presented as independent statements, each claiming a unique aspect. Therefore, both A and F could be correct depending on interpretation.

So E is incorrect. Option F asserts that glucose can be directly converted into protein. That's partially true, but I think it's more nuanced than that. Glucose isn't directly converted into proteins; instead, it undergoes several steps in the body, including glycolysis, the TCA cycle, and ultimately, the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, which leads to the synthesis of proteins via the Calvin-Benson cycle. So F is somewhat true but incomplete compared to option H. Option G says glucose cannot be stored in any form. That's clearly incorrect because there are multiple ways cells store glucose, including as free glucose (in the blood), glycogen, and starch. Therefore, G is wrong. Option H states that glucose is used exclusively for producing nucleic acids. That's incorrect because, similar to protein synthesis, glucose isn't solely used for making nucleic acids. Instead, it's primarily used in the TCA cycle and gluconeogenesis (the process where glucose is broken down to release energy). So H is incorrect.

Wait, I think I've heard that both gluconeogenesis (breaking down glucose for energy) and gluconeptosis (making glucose available for energy elsewhere) are part of metabolism. Also, some cells use glucose directly, so J might not be correct either. Now, reviewing my initial thoughts, A and F seem to make more sense. Let me double-check. For A, the statements cover primary energy, storage, and fat storage, which aligns with what I know. For F, since protein synthesis requires converting glucose to amino sugars, F is correct. So both A and F could be correct. But looking back, the user asked to answer with only a single letter, implying there's one correct option. Since multiple options could be correct, perhaps the intended answer was A, as it covers primary energy, storage, and fat storage, which are key aspects of cell metabolism.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So, glucose isn't exclusively used for nucleic acid production; it's used in both. Option I says glucose is only used structurally in cells. That's not quite right because it's used energetically and adaptively, not solely structurally. Option J claims glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is a dietary fiber. That's incorrect because glucose is a key metabolite throughout many biological processes. Based on this analysis, the most accurate statements are in option A and possibly another point, but looking back, option A seems to cover the main points of energy conversion into ATP, storing via glycogen, and providing energy for fat storage. However, I should double-check if there are other aspects I'm missing, like whether glucose serves other roles beyond just being an energy source. From my knowledge, yes, it plays a crucial role in various metabolic pathways, including those related to protein synthesis and carbohydrate metabolism. Therefore, the best answer aligns with option A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

The user has provided a list of options from A to J, each making a statement about how glucose is used or not used in different cellular processes. My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. It should be able to convert into other forms too, especially when cells are growing or needing to use more energy than just fat provides. Option C states that glucose is only used in amino acid synthesis. That doesn't align with my understanding; I believe glucose is a precursor for amino acids and plays a role in their synthesis. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in starch form. While storing glucose as starch makes sense in certain contexts, it's not exclusive\u2014it could also be stored elsewhere if needed. Option E points out that glucose is only used for energy. That's incorrect because cells require it for various processes beyond just energy. Option F says glucose can be directly converted into protein. Hmm, proteins do require some form of energy, often through amino acids, but glucose isn't the direct substrate.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nAlright, let's tackle this question about glucose's role in cell metabolism. The user has provided a list of options from A to J, each making a statement about how glucose is used or not used in different cellular processes. My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. It implies glucose isn't used elsewhere besides fat, which contradicts my understanding. Option C states that glucose is exclusively used in synthesizing amino acids. That\u2019s incorrect because amino acids are synthesized using other sugars like glucose, specifically via the Calvin cycle. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only as starch in humans. No, I recall that cells store glucose as both glycogen and freeform glucose, so it's not restricted to starch. Option E says glucose is only used for energy. While true, it's too simplistic because other uses include synthesis and storage, so maybe E isn\u2019t the best answer since it excludes other functions. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. Wait, no, that's not accurate either; proteins are made from amino acids, which come from glucose after being processed. Option G says glucose can\u2019t be stored in any form. Definitely false, as I mentioned earlier that it's stored as glycogen and free-form glucose. Option H states glucose is used to make nucleic acids exclusively. No, nucleic acids are synthesized from\u6838\u7cd6\u4f53\u4e0a\u7684tRNA\u548crRNA\uff0cwhich requires amino acids, not glucose. Option I says glucose is only used structurally in cells. That's incorrect because glucose serves multiple purposes beyond just structure. Option J suggests glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is a dietary fiber. No, that's completely wrong. Dietary fibers like carbs are metabolized, including glucose. \n\nSo going back, Option A seems to cover all the necessary aspects: energy use (glucose), storage (glycogen and perhaps even free glucose?), and conversion into fat. Even though there's some uncertainty about whether free glucose is considered storage, it's a common point of confusion, but the main idea aligns with what I know. Therefore, Option A should be the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all. I think glucose is used in multiple ways\u2014energy, storing, and maybe even some other processes. Option C states that glucose is only used in amino acid synthesis. That doesn't make sense either; I know that amino acids are synthesized from glucose derivatives, so this might be incorrect. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in starch form in humans. Starch is a major storage form for glucose, so I don't think this is accurate. Option E says glucose is only used for energy. While that's true in most situations, it's not exclusive. It can also be used for growth, repair, etc., so E isn't the best answer. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. Protein synthesis definitely requires glucose intermediates, especially in the form of glucose-6-phosphate. So F makes sense. Option G asserts that glucose cannot be stored in any form. That's clearly false since organisms do use glucose for both energy and storage. Option H states glucose is used exclusively for producing nucleic acids. That's incorrect; nucleic acids require glucose, but they're not exclusively. They're often produced from glucose via glycolysis and the Calvin cycle. Option I says glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. Again, this is too narrow. Cells have many uses beyond just storing and providing energy. Finally, option J mentions glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is a dietary fiber. No, that's completely wrong\u2014it plays a huge role in metabolism. So after going through each option, I'm more confident that option A is correct because it accurately describes glucose's roles across various processes in cell metabolism.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Glucose isn't the sole fuel source here; other sugars like ribose are used instead. So C is likely incorrect. Option D suggests that glucose can be stored only in the form of starch in human cells. Starch is a carbohydrate, so I think that's true because glucose is broken down into glucose-6-phosphate, which enters glycolysis and ultimately forms glucose-1-phosphate, which enters the citric acid cycle and stores as pyruvate before becoming palmitoyl-CoA. Palmitoyl-CoA becomes a precursor for storing in adipose tissue, where it becomes glucose-6-phosphate again, forming glycogen. So D could be correct if it's referring specifically to human cells, but wait, the answer needs to be a single letter, so maybe another option is better. Let me revisit my earlier thoughts. Option E says glucose is only used for energy production. Well, while gluconeogenesis involves glucose being broken down quickly, it's still primarily used as an energy source, especially after oxidation to CO2 and water. However, some sources suggest that even in liver cells, excess glucose is excreted, indicating that it's a significant energy consumer. So E might not capture all uses accurately. Option F states that glucose can be directly converted into protein. That doesn't seem right because protein synthesis requires multiple steps involving aminoacyl-tRNA transferases, enzymes, etc., along with coenzymes and cofactors. Glucose is metabolized into pyruvate, which enters the mitochondria for further processing, leading to acetyl-CoA, which is then used in the TCA cycle to produce NADH. Without the proper enzymes, conversion to protein wouldn't occur efficiently. So F might not be accurate. Option G claims that glucose cannot be stored in any form. From my previous knowledge, I know that under normal conditions, glucose can be converted into both glycogen and fat, meaning it can indeed be stored. So G is probably incorrect. Option H says glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. That's definitely wrong because nucleic acids are synthesized from\u6838\u7cd6\u4f53\u5185\u7684mRNA andtRNA, which are made fromrRNA and\u6838\u7cd6\u3002Glucose doesn't directly contribute to producing these molecules; it's more involved in biochemistry rather than gene expression. So H is incorrect. Option I states that glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. This is false because cells have various components, including lipids, carbohydrates, proteins, etc., all serving different functions. For example, lipids provide structural support, proteins serve functional roles, and carbohydrates are essential for structure and metabolism. So I is incorrect. Finally, Option J says glucose is not involved in cell metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. This is completely false since glucose is a fundamental energy currency for most cells, including humans. It plays a crucial role in providing energy, storing energy, and supporting various metabolic pathways. Therefore, none of the options A through J perfectly align with my understanding, except perhaps Option A, which mentions converting glucose into energy (ATP) and storing it (glc-glyc), but I'm not sure if it covers all aspects mentioned.

Option D states glucose can be stored only in starch form. Again, this seems incorrect since other forms like glycogen are used extensively. Option E says glucose is only used for energy production. While it's true that some cells do use glucose for energy, others do use it for storing energy or modifying proteins, so it's not exclusive. Option F claims glucose can be converted into protein directly. This makes sense because enzymes convert glucose into amino acids, which then form proteins. However, the initial conversion of glucose to these intermediates would require steps beyond direct conversion. Option G suggests glucose cannot be stored in any form. This is clearly wrong because different organisms have various ways to store glucose\u2014like glycogen in animals or starch in plants. Option H mentions glucose being used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. That's incorrect because nucleic acids are made from proteins, which come from amino acids derived from glucose. Option I states glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. This is false because many cells have internal components made from glucose, such as red blood cells. Option J says glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. This is completely incorrect; glucose is part of normal metabolic processes. After reviewing all the options, the most accurate statement is in option F, where glucose can indeed be converted directly into protein. Therefore, the correct answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage.

Option D suggests that glucose can be stored only in the form of starch in human cells. Starch is a carbohydrate, so it makes sense that it would be stored there.

While it's true that cells need glucose for energy, especially when growing or undergoing certain metabolic processes, they also use it for other things too. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. Protein synthesis involves converting glucose into amino acids, then assembling them into proteins.

Option G states that glucose cannot be stored in any form. That contradicts my earlier understanding where cells do use different forms of glucose for different purposes. Option H says glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. That's incorrect because nucleic acids are produced via a series of reactions starting with glucose, often involving amino acids and other enzymes. Option I claims glucose is only used as a structural component in cells.

My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible.

    "rollout": " If glucose were the only way to convert into fat, then other forms of fat wouldn't make sense. I think carbohydrates can be converted into various fats depending on the pathway, so B is incorrect. Option C states that glucose is exclusively used in the synthesis of amino acids. That doesn't sound accurate either. Cells use glucose for a variety of purposes beyond just building proteins; they're involved in everything from glycolysis to transporting molecules. So C isn't correct. Option D suggests glucose can be stored only in the form of starch in human cells. Starch is a common storage form for glucose, especially in plants, but in humans, it might vary depending on the individual. However, while storage is a possible function, I don't recall storing glucose solely in starch form, as other forms are more common. So D is probably not entirely true. Option E claims glucose is only used for energy production. While it's definitely used for energy, there are other uses as well. For example, during anabolic processes, cells still need glucose for growth and repair. So E is too narrow and excludes other uses. Option F says glucose can be directly converted into protein. Again, I'm pretty sure that's not the case. Protein synthesis typically requires amino acids, which come from glucose via glycolysis, but the conversion itself isn't direct. So F is incorrect. Option G states that glucose cannot be stored in any form. From what I know, glucose is often stored as glycogen or starch, but sometimes it can be stored as free glucose, particularly in certain tissues or under specific conditions. So G is not universally correct. Option H claims glucose is used to produce nucleic acids exclusively. That's completely wrong since nucleic acids require ribozymes, enzymes that recognize the sugar-phosphate backbone. Without glucose, these enzymes can't function properly, so H is incorrect. Option I asserts that glucose is only used as a structural component in cells. While glucose is present in many cell components like chromatin and DNA, it's not exclusively a structural component. It's also part of metabolic intermediates. So I is misleading. Option J suggests that glucose is not involved in cell metabolism but is only a dietary fiber. This is false because glucose is a key metabolite in most cells, including those producing proteins. Therefore, J is incorrect.

The user has provided a list of options from A to J, each making a statement about how glucose is used or not used in different cellular processes. My task is to determine which option is correct based on what I know about glucose metabolism. First, I'll go through each option one by one to understand their implications. Option A says that glucose is the primary source of energy for all cells, can be converted to glycogen and stored, and can be converted into fat for storage. This sounds familiar because I remember that during anabolic processes like growth, cells need energy (like fat breakdown) and also store energy (like glycogen). So this seems plausible. Option B claims that glucose can only be converted into fat. That doesn't sound right at all.",

Option C suggests glucose is only used in amino acid synthesis. No way, cells do use glucose for a lot more than just building proteins\u2014like in glycolysis, breaking down glucose into pyruvate, and then into acetyl-CoA for various reactions. Option D states that glucose can only be stored as starch in humans. That's incorrect because plants store glucose as glucose itself, and animals have other ways to store it too. Option E says glucose is only used for energy. While true for cells needing quick energy, it's not exclusive since they also use it for other processes. Option F claims glucose can be directly converted into protein. No, that's not accurate either. Cells convert glucose via glycolysis into pyruvate, which enters the mitochondria to generate ATP, and then converts into acetyl-CoA for other reactions. Protein synthesis requires other enzymes besides those involved in glucose metabolism. Option G asserts glucose cannot be stored in any form. Definitely false, as both carbohydrates and glucose are common forms of stored energy. Option H mentions glucose is used exclusively to make nucleic acids. That's incorrect because nucleic acids are synthesized using histones and other proteins, not glucose. Option I says glucose is only used structurally in cells. No, cells use glucose for various functions beyond structure, like signaling and metabolism. Option J states glucose isn't involved in metabolism but is a dietary fiber.
