  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes.\n\nReptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost.\n\nSo, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage.\n\nAnother thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense.\n\nThen there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation.\n\nOption E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases.\n\nOption F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So maybe their excretes less salt and more other substances. Option G and H mention excreting ammonia and urea respectively. I'm not sure if these are the main adaptations, but ammonia is definitely important for waste management.\n\nOption J lists several adaptations, including a dry skin and specific duct structures. Dry skin reduces water loss, and specific ducts allow for better recycling of water, which is exactly what I was thinking earlier with the secondary bladder and larger glomeruli.\n\nPutting it all together, the excretary system must have evolved to store lost water (secondary bladder), increase excrements where needed (more water storage), and manage salt levels appropriately (less salt). Also, the structure of the system allows for better water recycling, which matches options A, E, and J.\n\nLooking at the options provided, A, E, and J seem related. However, the question asks for a single answer. Since J combines multiple points, perhaps it's the best fit because it describes the comprehensive adaptation described in the question.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",
