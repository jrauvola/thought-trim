But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So having more salt excretion could be beneficial. Option G is about producing ammonia directly. I'm not sure about that; maybe it's more indirect production via enzymes. Option H mentions urea. Urea is another form of nitrogenous waste, but I'm not certain if that's the main pathway. Option J gives a detailed description of changes like a dry skin, smaller glomeruli, increased reabsorption, and excretion of urea or ammonia. That seems comprehensive. \n\nLooking at all these options, some seem more direct than others. For instance, having a secondary bladder (A) and the excretion of ammonia (D) both address water retention. However, J provides a broader explanation of how the system adapts, including structural changes and mechanisms to manage water loss effectively. It also mentions specific adaptations like a dry skin, which reduces the surface area exposed to water, thus retaining more water. \n\nI should consider whether the answer expects a single mechanism or a combination. Since the question asks for the \"evolution,\" multiple points make sense. However, looking at the options, J seems to cover several aspects clearly. It describes the complex series of ducts for water recycling, which supports the idea of using the skin's properties (like being dry) to absorb excess water. It also mentions conserved water and nitrogenous waste excretion, which ties back to their adaptation to different environments. \n\nTherefore, after considering each point and evaluating which ones best explain the transition, J seems to encapsulate the necessary details comprehensively.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. But I'm not sure if that's necessary here. Maybe it's more about managing salts locally.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. But some reptiles, especially those with gills, still need to manage their salt intake somehow. So maybe they adjust their salt excretion levels, but that's more about excreting salts rather than simply excreting ammonia. Option G mentions producing ammonia directly. While ammonia is useful, does that mean they've evolved to do it specifically? Maybe, but it's part of a broader strategy. Option H and I talk about urea, which is another form of excreted waste. Urea is more organic, so perhaps they use it instead of ammonia. But again, the main point here is conservation of water, so ammonia seems more relevant. Option J describes all these adaptations together: a coarse skin, smaller glomeruli, better reabsorption, and excreting nitrogenous wastes as urea. That seems comprehensive. \n\nSo putting it all together, the answer should reflect the key adaptations: secondary bladder (A), ammonia production (G), and a more efficient water recycling mechanism (I). Alternatively, having a secondary bladder allows them to retain water, while ammonia helps in managing their waste. So combining these, the best answer would be J because it covers all these aspects together.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So perhaps their excretory system adjusts to reduce salt loss. Option G mentions excreting ammonia directly. Turtles definitely do this, so G seems relevant. Option H is about urea, but ammonia is a common solvent, so that's covered in G. Option J gives a detailed description of changes like skin texture, size of glomeruli, etc., which all support the idea of conservation of water. Option I is about ducts recycling water, which supports the idea of efficient water use. Now, looking at the options, the question asks which single letter represents the correct answer. The options are A to I. I remember that both J and I are quite detailed descriptions. However, the question is asking about the evolution step-wise, so perhaps J is the best fit because it outlines the specific adaptations like skin texture and efficiency of water recycling. Alternatively, I might be overcomplicating it. Maybe the correct answer is J because it provides a comprehensive view of how the excretory system adapts. Since I'm supposed to choose only one letter, I'll go with J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life.

Option G talks about producing ammonia directly, which is another way to manage water loss, but again, it's part of a larger system. Option H suggests excreting nitrogenous wastes as urea, which is similar to option J.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So maybe their bodies shift towards being salt-free instead. That makes sense. Option G mentions evoking ammonia production directly. If a reptile produces ammonia directly, it might be more efficient than other methods. So J's point about conserving water with a dry skin and large glomeruli fits with that idea. Option H and I talk about urea production and complex ducts. Urea is another form of excreted waste, but if the system is already advanced, maybe urea isn't needed here. The complex ducts might be part of the system to handle different types of waste. Option C says smooth, wet skin. While skin type doesn't directly explain the transition, smooth skin might improve efficiency, especially for gases. However, the main changes are about water retention and waste management. So putting it all together, the answer should reflect both water storage and waste management adaptations.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions.

That sounds very similar to what I was thinking earlier. So putting it all together, the best options seem to be A, B, E, G, and J. Wait, the question asks for the evolution to account for transitioning from aquatic to terrestrial habitats. So the key changes are increased water retention (larger glomeruli), a secondary bladder, and perhaps ammonia production. Also, the skin being smooth and wet allows better absorption. So looking at the options, J covers all these points. It describes the structure changes, water retention, and ammonia production. Therefore, the correct answer should be J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

This makes sense because it involves multiple adjustments to manage water and nutrient excretion efficiently.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to choose the best fit. The question is about the evolution to conserve water. Having a secondary bladder (A) is important because it stores water when gills can't handle it. Excreting more water isn't ideal, but if they can manage better, they might excrete more. Producing ammonia (D) allows them to eliminate waste without needing to produce as much salt. Larger glomeruli (E) would help retain more water, which is good. Developing finer skin (C) would make them less likely to sweat, thus retaining more water. Decreased size of glomeruli (F) means each filters more water out, keeping more inside. Coarse, dry skin (J) protects against dehydration. Excreasing salt excretion (F) reduces salt loss, which is good for terrestrial life. Recycling water via ducts (I) ensures that any excess is reused, preventing overflow.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer should reflect several adaptations: secondary bladder, ammonia production, smaller glomeruli, dry skin, increased salt excretion, and efficient water recycling.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So, maybe they reduce salt excretion. Option G is about producing ammonia directly. That seems related to option D but perhaps more specific. Option H and I mention urea instead of ammonia. Urea is another form of excreted nitrogenous waste, so maybe some vary in production. Option J describes a complex system involving skin structure and ducts. This makes sense because it involves multiple adjustments to manage water and nutrient excretion efficiently.\n\nNow, looking at the options, I need to choose the best fit. The question is about the evolution to conserve water. Having a secondary bladder (A) is important because it stores water when gills can't handle it. Excreting more water isn't ideal, but if they can manage better, they might excrete more. Producing ammonia (D) allows them to eliminate waste without needing to produce as much salt. Larger glomeruli (E) would help retain more water, which is good. Developing finer skin (C) would make them less likely to sweat, thus retaining more water. Decreased size of glomeruli (F) means each filters more water out, keeping more inside. Coarse, dry skin (J) protects against dehydration. Excreasing salt excretion (F) reduces salt loss, which is good for terrestrial life. Recycling water via ducts (I) ensures that any excess is reused, preventing overflow.\n\nSo putting it all together, the correct answer should reflect several adaptations: secondary bladder, ammonia production, smaller glomeruli, dry skin, increased salt excretion, and efficient water recycling. Looking at the options, J fits all these points well.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So instead, they might focus on other solutes like ammonia. Option G mentions producing ammonia directly. That's another way they can manage their waste without relying solely on salt. Option H and I deal with urea and recirculation of water. Urea is a nitrogenous waste, and if they recycle water better, that would be helpful. However, I'm not sure if all these options are strictly necessary but just beneficial. \n\nNow, looking at the answer choices (A-I), the user wants only one letter. They mentioned \"only a single letter,\" implying a single choice. So I need to pick the best answer that accurately describes the evolution. Let me go through each option again:\n\nA: Secondary bladder for water storage. Makes sense because they lose water via gills and need to retain it.\n\nB: Excrete more water. Maybe possible, but considering they're already using gills, perhaps not necessary unless they're losing a lot.\n\nC: Smooth, wet skin. While skin type changes are part of adaptation, it's not necessarily the main change in the excretary system itself.\n\nD: Excrete nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. This is a common method for managing waste, especially useful in terrestrial habitats where salt isn't needed.\n\nE: Larger glomeruli. Yes, this is another adaptation to retain more water.\n\nF: Increase salt excretion. Not likely; salt isn't essential on land.\n\nG: Produce ammonia directly. Also a good point.\n\nH: Urea production. Could be related, but not as direct as ammonia.\n\nI: Complex ducts for water recycling.

Options B, D, E, G are possible answers. Since the question is about the transition from aquatic to terrestrial, both retaining water and managing waste are important.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how the reptilian excretary system changed to adapt to moving from an aquatic to a terrestrial habitat. Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean. So maybe they reduce salt excretion. Option G says their kidneys produce ammonia directly. That\u2019s another way they eliminate waste efficiently. Option H and I mention urea production and complex duct systems. Urea is a waste form, but I'm not sure if that's the main focus here. The main point seems to be about water retention rather than specific waste products. Between these options, I think the key points are either a secondary bladder (A), increased glomerulus size (E), or ammonia production (G). But I'm trying to remember if I've seen any studies suggesting all three. It might be that having a secondary bladder allows them to store excess water, and then using ammonia as a solvent for excreting waste makes sense. Also, larger glomeruli would help retain more water. So putting it together, the best answer should include both retaining water and using ammonia efficiently.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Since all these points are valid, but the question asks specifically about the transition from aquatic to terrestrial habitats, the key changes are likely related to water storage and excretion. Options B, C, and J focus on these aspects. However, the question wants the answer to be concise and single-lettered, so perhaps the most comprehensive answer is option J, as it directly addresses both water storage (via the complex ducts) and ammonia production for efficient hydration. Alternatively, if I had to choose based on the main mechanisms, I'd go with option G or H for ammonia production, but J seems broader and covers both water retention and ammonia use.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Let me start by recalling what I know about reptiles and their excretes. Reptiles like lizards, snakes, turtles, etc., have gills because they live in water, which helps them breathe underwater. But when they move to land, their gills can't function properly anymore, so they lose water through their gills. This is why they sweat a lot\u2014water turns into sweat, which gets trapped under their skin and lost. So, when they start living on land, they must find ways to store that lost water without losing it entirely. One idea is to have a secondary bladder or something similar. That would help them retain water during periods of low oxygen, maybe around sunset. I think option A says that's correct because they do have a secondary bladder for water storage. Another thought is about excreting more water. If they're losing water through gills, maybe they excrete more in certain conditions. But since they're adapting, they probably don't want to lose too much water. So having a secondary bladder makes sense. Then there's the idea of producing ammonia. Ammonia is used as a solvent when dealing with waste materials like urine. Turtles are known to produce ammonia, which helps in eliminating waste. So option D mentions excreting nitrogenous wastes as ammonia, which also aligns with this adaptation. Option E talks about developing larger glomeruli. Larger glomeruli mean less filtration per unit, which could help retain more water. That sounds plausible too. If you have larger glomeruli, each one retains more water before passing it on to the next, so overall water retention increases. Option F suggests increasing salt excretion for marine life. When they move to land, they might not need to excrete salt as much because there's no ocean.",

Option C is about smooth, wet skin, but while smooth skin protects against water loss, it doesn't directly relate to storing water. It's more about preventing external loss than internal storage. Option B is about excreting more water, which could happen if they adjust their excretion based on their environment, but the main change was likely due to using external storage mechanisms rather than changing excretion rates. Option G mentions producing ammonia directly. While ammonia is part of the process, the key adaptation was having a secondary bladder, so G might not be the best choice. Option H talks about excreting nitrogenous wastes as urea. Urea is a form of ammonia, just packaged differently, so H is related to G but might not capture the essence as well.
