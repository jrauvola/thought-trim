  "problem": "Euglena is a common green flagellate protozoan found in fresh water ponds. Describe briefly the method of locomotion, nutrition, and asexual reproduction in this organism.\n\nA. Euglena moves by contracting its body, carries on heterotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through fragmentation.\n\nB. Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition and can switch to heterotrophic when necessary, and reproduces asexually through cytokinesis.\n\nC. Euglena moves by pseudopodia, carries on heterotrophic nutrition, and reproduces sexually.\n\nD. Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but cannot shift to heterotrophic, and reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nE. Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on chemosynthetic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through sporulation.\n\nF. Euglena moves by undulating its flagellum, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under darkness, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission.\n\nG. Euglena moves by jet propulsion, carries on autotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through multiple fission.\n\nH. Euglena moves by cilia, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic under light, and reproduces asexually through binary fission.\n\nI. Euglena moves by gliding along surfaces, carries on autotrophic nutrition but can shift to heterotrophic in the absence of light, and reproduces asexually through budding.\n\nJ. Euglena moves by flagellum, carries on mixotrophic nutrition, and reproduces asexually through longitudinal binary fission and sporulation.",
