  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out the minimum number of base substitutions required to change codons from various amino acids to others. Let's take each part one by one.\n\nStarting with a), changing glutamic acid (GLN) to lysine (KLY). GLN has the codon G-403, which translates to a lysine residue. So in terms of amino acids, there are no changes needed because they're both lysine. Wait, but sometimes when you convert an amino acid to another, especially if it's a stop codon, you might have to substitute some bases. In this case, both are just lysine, so maybe zero substitutions? Hmm, but let me think again. If converting a protein from one amino acid to another doesn't involve any substitution, then yes, zero. But the options don't include zero, so perhaps I'm missing something here. Maybe considering that converting between two different codons might require some changes, but since both are KLY, maybe none needed. Alternatively, perhaps it's about the specific codon positions, like the third position being Lysine vs Glu. But wait, GLU is Gly, not Lysine. Oh! Wait, no, the user said glutamic acid to lysine. GLU is Glutamic Acid, which codes for Glutamine (G-403). YLD is Lysine (L-405). So actually, to go from GLU to LYS, we'd have to change the third position from G to L. That would be one substitution. Because the first two positions remain the same, only the third changes from G (G-403) to L (YLD).\n\nSo for a), it's 1 substitution.\n\nNext, b), changing leucine (LEU) to alanine (ALN). LEU is L-406, ALN is A-408. So the second and third positions change from L to A. The fourth position remains N. So how many substitutions? Third position: L \u2192 A (1), fourth position: N \u2192 N (no change). So total of 1 substitution.\n\nWait, but the question says \"minimum number,\" so maybe I should check if more substitutions could happen elsewhere. For example, if there's a possibility to use a different codon or substitution pattern, but in this case, it's straightforward\u2014only the third position needs substitution. So 1 substitution.\n\nBut looking back at the options provided, I see that option D mentions 1 substitution for leucine to alanine, etc. So perhaps that's correct.\n\nMoving on to c), changing phenylalanine (Phe) to glycine (Gly). Phe is F-407, Gly is G-404. So the fourth position changes from F to G. First three positions remain the same. So that's 1 substitution.\n\nd), changing valine (VAL) to glutamic acid (GLN). VAL is V-417, GLN is G-403. So the first, second, and third positions change from V to G. Each of these requires substitution. So that's 3 substitutions.\n\ne), changing valine to glutamic acid via glutamic acid to glutamic acid... Wait, the user wrote valine to glutamic acid as |valinetoglutamicacid|. Valine is V-417, glutamic acid is G-403. So the first, second, and third positions change from V to G. That's 3 substitutions.\n\nNow, compiling the answers:\n\na) 1 substitution.\nb) 1 substitution.\nc) 1 substitution.\nd) 3 substitutions.\ne) 3 substitutions.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n\nOption E says 2 substitutions for all amino acids, which isn't correct because our calculations show 1 for a-e.\n\nOption B lists substitutions as 2 for glutamic acid to lysine, 3 for leucine to alanine, 1 for phenylalanine to glycine, 1 for tryptophan to serine, and 3 for valine to glutamic acid. That seems off because our calculations show mostly 1s except for d and e.\n\nOption H suggests 1 for glutamic acid to lysine and tryptophan to serine, 3 for the rest. That also doesn't match.\n\nOption C says 1 for all substitutions, which is incorrect.\n\nOption D says 1 for leucine to alanine, 2 for glutamic acid to lysine, phenylalanine to glycine, and valine to glutamic acid, 3 for tryptophan to serine. That seems too high because our calculations say 1 for most.\n\nOption G says 3 for leucine to alanine, 1 for the rest. Doesn't fit.\n\nOption F lists 2 for glutamic to lysine, 1 for leucine to alanine, etc., totaling 2 for most. Not matching.\n\nOption J says 3 for glutamic to lysine, 2 for leucine to alanine, etc. Again, higher than our calculation.\n\nOption I suggests 1 for glutamic to lysine, 2 for leucine to alanine, etc. That matches our counts.\n\nWait, no, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check:\n\nFor a), GLN to KLY: third position G\u2192L (1 substitution).\nb), LEU to ALN: third position L\u2192A (1 substitution).\nc), Phe to Gly: fourth position F\u2192G (1 substitution).\nd), VAL to GLN: first three positions V\u2192G (3 substitutions).\ne), VAL to GLN: same as d) \u2192 3 substitutions.\n\nTotal: 1+1+1+3+3 = 9 substitutions across all parts. Now looking at the options:\n\nOption I states:\n1 for glutamic acid to lysine,\n2 for leucine to alanine,\n2 for phenylalanine to glycine,\n1 for tryptophan to serine,\n1 for valine to glutamic acid.\n\nThat adds up to 1+2+2+1+1=7, which is less than 9. Hmm, maybe I miscounted somewhere.\n\nWait, let's re-examine each part:\n\na) GLN (G-403) to KLY (Y-405): third position G\u2192L \u2192 1 substitution.\nb) LEU (L-406) to ALN (A-408): third position L\u2192A \u2192 1 substitution.\nc) Phe (F-407) to Gly (G-404): fourth position F\u2192G \u2192 1 substitution.\nd) VAL (V-417) to GLN (G-403): first, second, third positions V\u2192G \u2192 3 substitutions.\ne) VAL (V-417) to GLN (G-403): same as d) \u2192 3 substitutions.\n\nTotal: 1(a)+1(b)+1(c)+3(d)+3(e)=9.\n\nLooking at the options, none seem to add up to 9. Perhaps I misunderstood the substitutions. Maybe each amino acid requires multiple substitutions, such as changing the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth residues. Wait, but the problem didn't specify that; it was about substituting codons, meaning changing the amino acids directly. So each amino acid may require multiple substitutions if their codons differ in multiple positions.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer refers to the number of amino acid substitutions, not codon substitutions. But the question asks about base substitutions within the codons, so amino acid differences count per position.\n\nIn that case, for a), 1 substitution (third position G\u2192L).\nb), 1 substitution (third position L\u2192A).\nc), 1 substitution (fourth position F\u2192G).\nd), 3 substitutions (first, second, third positions V\u2192G).\ne), 3 substitutions (same as d)).\n\nAdding up to 9 substitutions, but the options don't reflect that. Therefore, perhaps the intended answer is based on the number of amino acid substitutions rather than codon-based ones. So checking the options again:\n\nOption I says 1 for a), 2 for b), etc., which sums to 7. Option E says 2 for all, which is incorrect. Option H says 1 for a and e, 3 for d and others, which sums to 1+1+3+3=8, still not matching.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the options. Looking back, option F lists substitutions as 2 for a, 3 for b, etc., summing to 2+3+1+3+3=12, which is way off.\n\nHmm, perhaps the question is referring to the number of amino acid substitutions, including those beyond the third position. For instance, some amino acids have conserved residues beyond the third position, requiring fewer substitutions. However, without specific data, it's hard to tell.\n\nGiven the time constraints, perhaps the closest option is E, which says 2 for all amino acids, but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the intended answer is based on amino acid substitutions only, ignoring codons, which would mean:\n\na) 1 substitution (G\u2192L)\nb) 1 substitution (L\u2192A)\nc) 1 substitution (F\u2192G)\nd) 3 substitutions (V\u2192G)\ne) 3 substitutions (V\u2192G)\n\nTotal: 9 substitutions, but none of the options match exactly. However, option I sums to 7, which is close but not exact.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question counts amino acid changes differently, such as considering that some amino acids have fewer substitutions. For example, tryptophan (TRP) has a fixed structure, so changing it might require fewer substitutions. But without knowing the specific cases, it's speculative.\n\nGiven the available options, the most plausible answer, even though it's not perfect, might be option I, assuming some substitutions can be done in fewer steps. Or perhaps the correct answer is E, but that contradicts my earlier calculation.\n\nAfter careful consideration, I believe option I is the best choice despite the discrepancy in the total count.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",
