  "solution": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer.\n\nI remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences.\n\nLooking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding.\n\nOption J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence.\n\nOption F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence.\n\nOption B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids.\n\nWait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence.\n\nAlternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem possible, but the question asks for experimental evidence, which I think refers to the actual experiments themselves, not just the outcomes.\n\nSo the most direct evidence comes from the ribosome experiments, where mutations in genes lead to defects in protein folding, hence mismatches in amino acid sequences.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
