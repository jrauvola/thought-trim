One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. That would support the idea that genes control them. So E might refer to mutation effects, but maybe the actual evidence is earlier, like the ribosome experiment. Alternatively, I recall that in the 1960s, experiments showed that altering a gene affects the protein structure. For example, in the case of the rRNA gene, mutations in its encoding led to changes in amino acid sequences. So perhaps that's what E is referring to. Alternatively, option J is about uniformity across species, which is another supportive point. Hmm, I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to recall: the classic experiment is about ribosomes and whether their function depends on the absence of a gene. If a gene is missing, the ribosome can't assemble correctly, leading to a wrong amino acid sequence. This directly links the absence of a gene to a change in amino acids. So E might actually be referring to that aspect. Therefore, E could be the correct answer since it discusses the effect of mutations caused by gene defects.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence amino acids. So option E is about mutation leading to issues, but if a gene is absent, then mutations in that gene wouldn't matter much because the gene itself wasn't there. Hmm. Alternatively, maybe option J is referring to the fact that proteins look similar across species despite being produced by different genes. But that's more about evolution and common descent rather than direct evidence of gene control. Option I mentions ribosome malfunction producing identical sequences. That seems similar to the earlier point about mutations in genes causing issues. So I'm getting a bit confused here. Maybe I should focus on the most established experiments. The classic example is the ribosome experiment where a gene's absence caused a mismatch. This showed that genes directly influence the amino acid sequence. So among the options, E might refer to this specific finding. Also, option J states that identical sequences suggest genetic control, which aligns with the idea that genes determine amino acid sequences.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. However, the question asks for evidence, which might include observations of gene function. Option E specifically mentions mutation in a gene causing a problem, but maybe it's more about the effect of genes on proteins rather than the direct evidence of control. Alternatively, option G talks about amino acid being controlled by environment, which contradicts the question since we're looking for evidence that genes do control them. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which would show their origin but doesn't explain control. Option J emphasizes uniformity across all organisms, reinforcing genetic control. So putting it together, I think option J is the best fit because it directly addresses the role of genes in determining amino acid sequences.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the best fit since it connects the absence of a gene to a problem in protein synthesis. Alternatively, option J also makes sense because identical sequences suggest genetic control. Hmm, maybe both E and J are possible, but looking back, option E specifically mentions mutation in genes affecting amino acid sequences, whereas J is about uniformity across species.

This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes control them. So among the options, E seems to relate to mutations caused by gene defects, but maybe it's about the effect on protein structure, which could be seen through changes. Alternatively, J is about the presence of identical sequences across species, which also supports genetic control. Hmm. I'm a bit confused here. Let me try to recall more details. From what I remember, the first successful proof came from Griffith's experiment with mules, where the loss of the horse chromosome 21 caused a loss of pigmentation. This showed that certain genes affect protein synthesis. Then later, experiments with ribosomes showed that if a gene is missing, the ribosome can't function, so the proteins don't match. So that's a direct link between genes and amino acid sequences. So looking at the options, E is about mutations causing issues, which relates to the effect of genes. Alternatively, J is about identical sequences across species, which also ties into genetic control. But the question is specifically about experimental evidence indicating that genes control amino acid sequences. So both E and J seem plausible, but E emphasizes the impact of mutations due to gene defects, while J looks at the similarity across species. However, the most direct evidence comes from the ribosome experiments, which show that the absence of a gene causes a failure in protein synthesis, thus altering amino acid sequences. Therefore, E might be the best fit.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes control them. So option E might be referring to that. Alternatively, I recall that in E. coli, when the rRNA gene is deleted, the ribosome can't function, leading to a truncated protein called rRNAsomething. In this case, the amino acid sequence would differ because the ribosome can't recognize the missing gene's product. So that's a direct experimental evidence.

This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, looking at the options, E is about mutation causing issues, which fits because if a gene is mutated, the protein changes. So E seems to fit better than other options. Alternatively, option J also relates to genetic control, but it's more about observations after evolution. Hmm, now I'm confused. Let me think again. The question asks specifically for experimental evidence. The ribosome example is an experiment where a gene's absence caused a problem, showing that the gene affects the outcome. So E fits because it attributes the issue to mutation in a gene, thus showing causation between gene and amino acid sequence. So E would be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence amino acid sequences. Therefore, option E is probably referring to that aspect, even though the exact wording might differ slightly. Alternatively, another possibility is that the correct answer is G, but G says aminoacids are determined by environment, which contradicts the question since the question is about evidence, not just assumptions.

    "rollout": " So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. However, the options don't specify that; they're just statements. So looking again, option E refers to a study by Ingram where mutating a gene caused a problem, leading to incorrect amino acids. While that's important, it's more about the effect of mutations rather than direct evidence of gene control influencing the sequence. Option J argues based on species similarity, which is more of an empirical observation. Alternatively, option G says aminoacids are determined by environment, which contradicts the idea that genes control them. Option C is opposite, stating genes don't control amino acids, which is clearly wrong. Option D talks about removing genes affecting the sequence, which also seems off. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which relates to ribosomes and gene function but doesn't directly show control. Option A is saying the amino acid sequence isn't related to genetics, which is likely false. Option B is about direct observation, which could be part of the evidence, but the question asks for experimental evidence indicating gene control. Option F is about identical sequences across species, which supports genetic control through evolution.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. However, the options don't specify that; they're just statements. So looking again, option E refers to a study by Ingram where mutating a gene caused a problem, leading to incorrect amino acids. While that's important, it's more about the effect of mutations rather than direct evidence of gene control influencing the sequence. Option J argues based on species similarity, which is more of an empirical observation. Alternatively, option G says aminoacids are determined by environment, which contradicts the idea that genes control them. Option C is opposite, stating genes don't control amino acids, which is clearly wrong. Option D talks about removing genes affecting the sequence, which also seems off. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which relates to ribosomes and gene function but doesn't directly show control. Option A is saying the amino acid sequence isn't related to genetics, which is likely false. Option B is about direct observation, which could be part of the evidence, but the question asks for experimental evidence indicating gene control. Option F is about identical sequences across species, which supports genetic control through evolution. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing same sequences, which aligns with the earlier point about gene impact. So putting it together, both B and I seem relevant, but since the question specifically asks for experimental evidence, I think the best fit is either E or I. However, E is about mutation effects, while I is about ribosomal issues. Given that the question is about direct evidence, I might lean towards E, but I'm not entirely sure.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence the amino acid sequences. Therefore, option E, which states that mutation in a gene causes an abnormal sequence, fits this scenario. Alternatively, option B is about direct observation in live cells, which could also show that genes attach to amino acids. Hmm. Maybe both B and E are possible, but the question asks for the single letter answer indicating the evidence, so probably E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening.

Therefore, the correct answer should be E, because it's about the effect of mutations in genes on the amino acid sequences. Alternatively, option J also makes sense because identical sequences suggest control, but perhaps the most direct evidence comes from the ribosome experiments. Wait, another angle: the question asks for experimental evidence. The ribosome experiment is an experimental setup where a gene is mutated (or absent) and observed. If the resulting protein has a different amino acid sequence, it shows that the gene affects the protein. So E fits here because it attributes the mutation in a gene to an abnormal amino acid sequence. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence amino acids. Therefore, option E might be referring to this phenomenon. Alternatively, another option could be G, which says aminoacids are determined by environment, but that's more about regulation rather than causation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence amino acid sequences. Therefore, option E might be referring to the effect of mutations in genes on protein structure, which is a biological consequence rather than direct evidence of causation. Alternatively, option J suggests that proteins from different species show similar sequences, implying a shared origin via genes, but that's more about evolution than direct evidence. Option G says aminoacids are controlled by environment, which contradicts what we know. Option C is the opposite; genes don't control them. Option D talks about removing genes affecting amino acid sequences, but that doesn't explain why they exist in the first place. Option A says the amino acid sequence isn't related to genetics, which is false because we know they are.

If E is referring to the effect of mutation disrupting a gene on the amino acid sequence, then it's showing the relationship between genes and amino acids through mutation effects. Alternatively, option B is about directly observing the attachment of genes to amino acids. That could be another angle, but I'm not sure if that's the primary evidence sought after. Another point is option G, which says aminoacids are determined by environment. That's more about post-translational regulation, which is indirect. Option C is the opposite; genes don't control amino acids. Option D is about removing genes affecting amino acids. Not sure. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material. That relates to ribosomes and gene expression, but again, it's about how genes influence the outcome. Option I talks about ribosomal malfunction producing matching sequences elsewhere. That also ties into the first idea. So putting it together, the most direct evidence I recall is the ribosome experiment where gene disruption caused misfolding of proteins. Therefore, option E fits best because it discusses the effect of mutations in genes on the amino acid sequences.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence the amino acid sequences. Therefore, option E might be referring to that, even though it's more about mutation effects rather than direct attachment. Alternatively, another option might better fit. Let me reconsider. Option G says aminoacids are determined by environment, which contradicts the question. Option H is about synthesizing amino acids without genetic material, which relates more to synthetic biology, not necessarily the evidence we're looking for. Option C is about genes having no control, which is opposite of what the question asks. Option D talks about removing genes affecting amino acid sequences, which seems like an inverse effect. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing identical sequences, which aligns with the ribosome example I thought of earlier. So that would point to option I being correct. Alternatively, since the question is about what evidence directly shows that genes control amino acid sequences, option I provides a specific example within a lab setting. However, option E is about mutation effects, which could also indicate a lack of control. Hmm. I'm getting a bit confused here. Let me try to recall: The classic example is that the absence of the rRNA gene causes ribosomes to fail, leading to incorrect amino acid sequences. So this experiment demonstrates that genes (specifically rRNA) influence the amino acid sequences. So among the options, E is about mutation effects, but maybe that's still experimental evidence supporting the idea that genes control amino acids. Alternatively, J states that identical sequences suggest genetic control, which is more of an observation than experimental evidence. Option I is a specific case within a controlled study, which would provide evidence that genes do influence amino acids. So I'm leaning towards either E or I. Since the question is about experimental evidence, I think E is a good candidate because it describes a real-world experiment (in the lab) that showed the effect of missing genes on amino acid sequences.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Option B is about direct observation in live cells, which could show physical attachment but not necessarily causation. Option H is about synthesis without genetic material, which doesn't make sense because genes provide the necessary materials. Option I is about ribosome malfunction producing identical sequences, which fits with the ribosome example. So both E and I seem related. However, the question asks for experimental evidence, so maybe I should focus on the ribosome example. Option E specifically talks about mutation in a gene causing abnormal amino acid sequences, which aligns with the ribosome experiment. Therefore, the correct answer is E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
