    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence.

Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem plausible. Wait, but the question asks for experimental evidence indicating that genes control amino acid sequences. So E is about mutation effects, which is part of the evidence, while I is about the consequences of a gene being absent. Both point to the idea.

Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem plausible. Hmm. The question asks specifically for experimental evidence that genes control amino acid sequences. The most direct evidence comes from seeing the effect of missing genes on protein structure, such as mismatches observed in ribosome function.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem relevant. But looking at the options provided, the user wants a single answer. The most direct evidence would likely involve the ribosome experiment, where mutations in genes lead to changes in amino acid sequences. So I'll go with E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence.

Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. Both E and I seem plausible.

Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. Both B and E could be correct, but since the question asks for experimental evidence, E is more about the effect of mutations on the outcome, whereas B is about seeing the association in live cells. However, the primary evidence comes from the ribosome experiments showing the link between gene presence and protein sequence. So I think E is the best answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. Both E and I seem plausible, but I think E is more about the effect of mutation on the sequence, while I is about the mechanism causing defects. Since the question asks for evidence that genes control amino acid sequences, both could be valid, but I'm less sure about E because it specifically mentions mutation in a gene, whereas I is about the result of that mutation. However, given the options, I'll go with E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. But I'm a bit confused because both B and E seem plausible. However, the question asks specifically about experimental evidence, and B is about direct observation in live cells, while E is about the effect of mutation on the sequence. Since the question is about evidence that genes control, E seems more about the mechanism\u2014how changing genes affects the sequence. Whereas B is about seeing it happen in real-time. Hmm, I'm still unsure. Another angle: the most well-known experiment that links genes to amino acids is the ribosome experiment. In that study, they showed that the absence of the rRNA gene caused ribosomes to fail, leading to nonfunctional proteins. This demonstrated that the gene plays a role in determining the amino acid sequence. So option E, which talks about mutation causing issues, fits better here. But wait, I'm also thinking that option J ties it to the uniformity across species, which is another piece of evidence but not the same as the direct evidence of the gene's role.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. But the question specifically asks for evidence that genes control the amino acid sequences, so both I and E seem relevant. However, the most direct evidence comes from the ribosome experiments, so I think option E is the best fit.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences.

Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem plausible. But looking at the options, I need to choose just one. Since the question asks for experimental evidence, and I know that experiments showed that genes were necessary for proper protein synthesis, including ribosome function, then option E is about the effect of a gene mutation on a protein's amino acid sequence, which directly links genes to amino acid changes.

Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening.

That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. So both E and I seem plausible. But looking at the options, only one should be correct. Since the question asks for experimental evidence, I think E is better because it specifically mentions a mutation caused by a gene, demonstrating causation. Whereas I is more about the outcome after a mutation. So I'll go with E.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which answer corresponds to the question about experimental evidence showing that genes control amino acid sequences in proteins. Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. Both E and I seem plausible.

One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein.",

That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids.

This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence.

Let me break it down. First, the question is asking for what evidence supports the idea that genes determine these amino acids. The options are labeled A to J, each making a statement. My task is to pick one correct answer. I remember that when studying genetics, especially at the molecular level, there were some key experiments. One famous one involves ribosomes and their role in protein synthesis. I think that in lab settings, they saw that without a specific gene (like the rRNA gene), ribosomes couldn't assemble properly. This led to a mismatched amino acid sequence in the proteins made. So if a gene isn't present, the resulting protein doesn't match expectations. That seems relevant because it shows direct interaction between genes and amino acid sequences. Looking at the options, option E says \"Ingram's discovery was proof that a mutation in a gene resulted in an abnormal amino acid sequence in a protein.\" Wait, but I thought it was about ribosome malfunction leading to mismatched sequences. Maybe E refers more to mutation effects rather than the direct evidence about genes controlling amino acids. Or perhaps E is talking about how mutations in genes cause problems, but maybe that's part of the broader understanding. Option J mentions that proteins from different species have identical sequences, suggesting genetic control. But that might be more of an evolutionary or phylogenetic argument rather than direct experimental evidence. Option F talks about identical sequences in unrelated proteins. That sounds like it points towards common ancestry, supporting genetic control. But again, that's more of an observational fact rather than experimental evidence. Option B is about directly observing genes attached to amino acids in live cells. That sounds more like in vivo studies where you can see the process happening. But I'm not sure if that's considered the same as the evidence that genes control amino acids. Wait, going back to the ribosome experiment, when a gene is missing, the ribosomes can't form correctly, causing a mismatch. This shows that the absence of a gene leads to a change in amino acid sequence. So that would support the idea that genes influence these sequences. Therefore, option E might be the right choice here because it discusses a mutation in a gene affecting the sequence. Alternatively, option I says ribosome malfunction causes identical sequences elsewhere. That also makes sense because if the gene isn't present, the ribosome can't function, leading to a defect in the protein. Both E and I seem relevant. However, the question specifically asks for experimental evidence indicating that genes control amino acids. Option E focuses on mutation effects, while I highlights the functional consequence of gene absence. Maybe both are valid, but since the question asks for evidence, perhaps E is better because it's about mutation disrupting the gene's effect on amino acids.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",
