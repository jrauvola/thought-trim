Option I says non-random mating causes differential reproduction. That fits well because if certain traits make mating harder or more common, that leads to varying reproductive success. Option J states that all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That would imply no selection pressure, meaning no differential reproduction. But without selection, there wouldn't be any differential reproduction either. Option K mentions differences in offspring fertility. That's a possibility, but again, without specific selection pressures, it's not necessarily differential reproduction. Option L says all offspring inherit randomly, which is too broad and doesn't account for any selection mechanisms. Option M talks about physical strength, which again is part of heritability but not causing differential reproduction. Option N says all genotypes have the same survival rate, which is the opposite of differential reproduction. Option O suggests environmental temperature affects reproduction. Hmm, but that's similar to F and H. Finally, option P says differential reproduction is when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That aligns with J, which says all offspring inherit randomly regardless of parents, implying no selection. But wait, J is saying they're inherited randomly regardless of parents, so it's more about genetics than reproduction. Maybe I confused the options earlier. Let me go back.\n\nThe best fit seems to be option I: differential reproduction occurs when nonrandom mating, differential fecundity, or differences in zygote viability/fecundity occur. That makes sense because these factors can lead to varying survival rates across genotypes, resulting in differential reproduction. So, putting it together, the answer should be I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That seems too narrow; strength isn't the main factor. Option H mentions species strength. Again, too vague. Option I says that non-random mating leads to differential reproduction. That fits because if parents don't mix randomly, the offspring will have traits that weren't present in the parents. Option J suggests random inheritance regardless of parents' genotypes. That would mean no selective pressure or heritable factors. Option K isn't here. Option L isn't either. Option M isn't relevant. Option N isn't listed. Option O talks about having the same genotype for all offspring. That would be random mating without any selection, which again wouldn't create differential reproduction. Finally, option P states it's based on environmental temperature. That aligns with how temperature affects survival rates across generations, especially in environments where temperature changes significantly. So putting it together, I think P is the best answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That might be more about individual fitness in general, not specifically about how they contribute to reproduction rates. Option H connects to physical strength again, which might not be directly relevant here. Option I explains it as non-random mating causing issues. Non-random mating does lead to differential reproduction because it affects the likelihood of certain genotypes reproducing. For example, if males preferentially mate with certain females, the offspring will reflect those preferences. Option J suggests that offspring inherit traits randomly regardless of parents. That's the definition of Mendelian genetics under ideal conditions, but in reality, many factors affect survival and fertility, leading to differential reproduction. Option K is missing, so I'll skip it. Finally, Option L isn't listed, so I can ignore it too.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That's similar to option H, both talking about individual strength affecting reproduction. Maybe they're redundant. Option H says it's related to physical strength. Hmm, that's interesting. If physical strength affects how strong an organism is, that could influence survival rates.

That doesn't make much sense because parents provide the genes, so they should determine how the offspring express them. The idea here is probably similar to Mendelian genetics, where traits are passed on independently based on parents' alleles. However, I'm not entirely confident about J. Option K isn't listed, so I'll skip it. \n\nSo, putting it together:\n- Differential reproduction involves varying survival rates.\n- Factors include predators (B), non-random mating (I), etc.\n- Equal survival rates (A) don't fit because some genotypes may have higher chances.\n- Heritable traits (G) aren't directly causing differential reproduction.\n- Environmental factors (F, H) can influence survival rates.\n- Random mating (E) vs. non-random (I): I is better as it explains heritable differences caused by selective mating patterns.\n\nTherefore, the best answers seem to be B, I, and J. But wait, J says all offspring inherit traits randomly, which doesn't make sense because parents pass genes, so it's not random. Maybe the closest is I, which deals with nonrandom mating causing differential reproduction. So I think B, I, and J are possible, but J seems incorrect. So perhaps the answer is B, I, and J, but considering J is wrong, the most accurate ones are B and I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That seems too narrow; strength affects many traits, not directly causing differential reproduction between genotypes. Option H connects to physical strength again, so probably not the right choice. Option I explains it as non-random mating resulting from factors like differential fertility or zygote viability. That aligns with what I thought earlier\u2014genetic factors like selection and heritability can cause some genotypes to produce more offspring. Option J says all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That doesn't make sense because parents' genes determine the offspring's traits. If the parents had different alleles, the offspring will reflect both. Option K isn't listed here. Option L isn't available either. So, narrowing down, I think option I is the best answer.

Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That's too vague; physical strength affects survival but doesn't directly explain differential reproduction between genotypes. Option H connects to species strength. Again, too general without specifics. Option I defines differential reproduction as when viability can't be explained by random mating due to factors like non-random mating, lower fertility, etc. That seems accurate because it's about why some genotypes don't replicate as much. Option J describes random mating leading to equal inheritance, which contradicts differential reproduction since that wouldn't show differences. So the correct answer should relate to factors causing some genotypes to have higher survival rates. Looking back, option I seems best because it captures both non-random mating effects and varying fertility rates. So I think the correct letter is I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Nonrandom mating can lead to differential fertility or survival. For example, if males prefer certain phenotypes, their offspring might have a skewed sex ratio. Option J suggests that all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That sounds like Mendelian inheritance, where traits are passed independently, but even then, it's a specific case where the parents' genotypes don't affect the offspring's traits.

Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That's more about individual traits and how they contribute to reproductive success, but again, it's not the main cause of differential reproduction. Option H connects to physical strength, so similar reasoning as G here. Option I describes when nonrandom mating affects offspring. Yeah, this seems close. Nonrandom mating can lead to differential fertility or survival. For example, if males prefer certain phenotypes, their offspring might have a skewed sex ratio. Option J suggests that all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That sounds like Mendelian inheritance, where traits are passed independently, but even then, it's a specific case where the parents' genotypes don't affect the offspring's traits. However, this is a subset of differential reproduction where the outcome depends entirely on chance without any interaction between parents. Option K isn't provided, so I'll skip it. Option L isn't mentioned either. Finally, option M isn't present. \n\nSo, going back, I think I was confused earlier but now I see that option I fits better. It explains that nonrandom mating leads to differential reproduction because the fates of offspring aren't purely random anymore. When parents mate in a way that's influenced by other factors like age, behavior, or environment, the outcomes aren't just random. This makes sense because such influences are external to genetic transmission and directly impact survival and reproduction probabilities. Therefore, the answer should be I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Option G relates to physical strength. That seems too narrow and probably not the main factor. Option H suggests it's about the strength of the species. Again, too vague. Option I explains that non-random mating leads to differential reproduction. Yeah, that fits because if parents don't choose mates randomly, some genotypes will end up passing on traits more often. Option J says it's when all offspring inherit traits randomly. Wait, that's more about genetic drift, which is a different concept altogether. It doesn't directly relate to differential reproduction. So, putting it together, the best fit seems to be option I. It accurately describes how non-random mating, differing reproductive success, or varying zygote/future offspring viability/risk can lead to differential reproduction.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That's too narrow; strength isn't the main factor in reproduction. Option H talks about species strength, which again, isn't the primary mechanism. Option I says nonrandom mating leads to differential offspring. Yeah, that aligns with how heredity works through nonrandom fertilization. Option J says random mating regardless of parents' genotypes. That doesn't make much sense. If mating is random, the offspring should inherit genes randomly without any preference between parents. So I think J is incorrect. The best option left is I because it correctly identifies that nonrandom mating causes differential reproduction.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. That seems too narrow; strength is a trait, not a factor in differential reproduction. Option H suggests it's related to strength again, which doesn't seem right. Option I explains that non-random mating causes differential reproduction. That makes sense because if parents don't choose mates randomly, some genotypes might have a higher chance of reproducing, leading to differential success. Option J says that all offspring inherit traits randomly. Again, that's more about Mendelian genetics where traits are passed independently, but real life often has some correlation. The key here is that differential reproduction involves unequal survival or reproductive success based on genotype. So looking back, I think option I captures both the mechanism and the underlying reason. It accounts for how non-random mating leads to differential success without necessarily requiring Mendelian inheritance. So I believe the answer is I.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. This seems too specific and probably not the general definition. Option H talks about being related to strength. Again, too specific. Option I says that differential reproduction occurs when the outcome depends on random mating and that other factors like non-random mating or differential fertility lead to different outcomes. That aligns with how selection works\u2014some genotypes may have a higher chance of passing on traits due to their fitness. Option J says it's when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parents. That sounds similar to random mating but doesn't account for the possibility of selection bias or other factors that could still lead to differential reproduction. Option K isn't listed here, so I don't need to worry about it. Option L isn't mentioned either. Finally, Option M is about environmental temperature during breeding seasons. This ties into how temperature affects survival, but again, it's not the defining factor of differential reproduction. \n\nSo, going back, the best fit seems to be option I. It correctly identifies that differential reproduction arises not just from random mating but also from other factors like selection pressure, differing reproductive success among genotypes, and possibly unequal mating chances. It explains that outcomes depend on various influences beyond pure randomness.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Option H connects to physical strength as well, which again points towards overall fitness rather than specific genotypic differences. Option I describes non-random mating leading to differential outcomes. This fits better because if parents don't mix randomly, the offspring might have traits that aren't present in either parent, leading to unequal reproduction. Option J says all offspring inherit traits randomly. That's too simplistic; even with random mating, some traits might still show up in the offspring, especially if they're dominant. Option K isn't listed here, but generally, factors like predation, environmental stressors, environmental temperature, etc., can drive differential reproduction. So putting it together, option I seems to best capture both differential reproduction and the factors involved.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

So, I think I need to pick between A, B, E, F, G, H, I, or J. From my earlier analysis, A is incorrect because it's about equal survival, not differential. B is about predators, which could drive differential reproduction, especially in environments where predators vary in their impact. E and F don't seem right either. G and H are talking about strength, which might influence, but not directly causing differential reproduction. I and J don't fit because they suggest randomness without considering parental effects.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is E",

Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. Not directly about reproduction; maybe indirectly through survival chances. Option H suggests strength affects reproduction, but again, not specifically tied to reproduction itself. Option I explains that non-random mating causes differential outcomes. This aligns with how different genotypes interact in reproduction, especially if they don't assort independently. Option J says all offspring inherit traits randomly. Again, this is more about Mendelian genetics where traits assort independently, leading to a 100% ratio of offspring types. But in reality, this is rare and influenced by various factors, not necessarily the case here. Option K isn't listed, so I'll skip that. Finally, Option L isn't present either. So considering these, I think option I is the best fit because it describes the scenario where non-random mating leads to differential reproduction.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. Maybe stronger species have better reproductive success, but again, it depends on how strong they are compared to others. Option H is about relating to physical strength. Similar to G, perhaps, but I think G is broader. Option I explains that nonrandom mating causes differential reproduction. That aligns with my initial thought. Option J says differential reproduction happens when all offspring inherit traits randomly. That sounds like Mendel's laws, where independent assortment leads to random segregation, resulting in gametes without any preference for one allele over another. So, if all offspring get their alleles independently, there's no differential reproduction because everyone ends up with the same combination. But wait, that's not necessarily true; some might still have different combinations. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing things up here. Option K isn't listed, so I'll skip. Option L isn't either. Option M isn't part of the original options. So, putting it together, the best answer should be I because it correctly describes how nonrandom mating leads to differential reproduction, considering factors like selection pressure.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is I",

Differential reproduction occurs when all offspring inherit traits randomly, regardless of parental genotypes\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out what differential reproduction means and what factors cause it. Let me start by understanding each term. Differential reproduction refers to situations where individuals of different genotypes produce offspring at different rates. That makes sense because if two parents have different combinations of genes, their offspring might end up being more or less likely to survive or reproduce. So, looking at the options: Option A says that differential reproduction is due to equal survival rates for all genotypes. Wait, no\u2014that's more like equal survival, not differential. Because some genotypes might actually have higher survival rates than others. So maybe A isn't correct. Option B mentions predators driving differential reproduction. That sounds plausible because predators would affect survival rates depending on the environment. But I'm not sure if that's always the case or just a possible factor. Option C talks about certain traits preventing mating. This seems more like something that could lead to heredity rather than differential reproduction. Like if one trait makes a parent unable to mate with another, then the offspring would carry those traits, leading to heritable differences, not differential reproduction. Option D states that mutation is the only factor influencing offspring. No, that doesn't sound right. Mutation can happen in any genotype, but other factors like selection (which is related) also play a role in differential reproduction. Option E says it's purely based on random mating. That would mean there's no influence from other factors besides chance. But we know that other things like environmental pressures, predators, and heritable traits can influence outcomes beyond random chance. Option F is about environmental temperature affecting reproduction. While temperature can influence survival rates, it's not the primary driver of differential reproduction unless specific conditions favor certain genotypes over others. Option G relates to physical strength. This is too vague; I think it's better to focus on biological factors rather than physical strength. Option H suggests it's related to physical strength. Again, too broad without context.
