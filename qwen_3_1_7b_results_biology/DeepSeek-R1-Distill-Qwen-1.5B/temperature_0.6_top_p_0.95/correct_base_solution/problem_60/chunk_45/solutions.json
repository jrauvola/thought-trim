First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, C directly addresses components.

Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate.

However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive.",

From my notes, the nuclear membrane is a double-layered structure consisting of two membranes connected by nuclear pores. It's semi-permeable, allowing certain molecules but not others. So it's made up of these two layers, and the pores enable communication. Therefore, option C is correct in describing its structure and function regarding nuclear communication. Option G is correct in stating it's a barrier, but perhaps the primary function is encapsulation, which is covered in C. Since the question is asking for the structure and function, both aspects are important. But looking again, option C mentions nuclear pores for nuclear communication, which directly relates to the function. Option G is about the barrier aspect.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, if the question is about the structure, then C is better. But the question combines structure and function. Maybe the best answer is G because it accurately describes the role of the nuclear membrane as an impermeable barrier. Or is C more accurate? Wait, the question is whether the membrane has those features or not. Since the user asked for the structure and function, both aspects are important. But looking at the options again, C mentions two leaflets and nuclear pores, which directly address both parts of the description. G mentions being a barrier, which is a key function. However, the question doesn't ask which is more functional\u2014it just asks which describes the structure and function. So both C and G are correct, but since we have to pick one, perhaps C is the better choice because it covers the structural aspect (two leaflets) and includes the function (communication via nuclear pores). Alternatively, G is correct in describing the membrane's role as a barrier, but maybe the question expects a broader answer that includes both structure and function. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. In many textbooks, the nuclear membrane is described as being a double-layered structure (so G is correct), and it has nuclear pores for nuclear-to-yolk communication. So perhaps G is the correct answer. But I'm not entirely sure. Another angle: the structure of the nuclear membrane involves two leaflets separated by a fluid interface. It also has nuclear pores, which are channels where materials move between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Chlorophyll is part of chloroplasts, which aren't directly related to the nuclear membrane. So G is correct in terms of its role as a barrier. Therefore, despite some confusion, I'll go with G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, maybe both are correct, but likely G is the better answer because it directly addresses the membrane's role as a barrier.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, if the question is asking solely about the structure and function, then both aspects (structure and function) are covered in C and G. But I think C is about components, and G is about the function. Since the question includes both structure and function, maybe the best answer is C or G. Wait, looking again, the options are separate. Perhaps the correct answer is both C and G, but since only one can be chosen, I'll go with G because it directly addresses the structure and function.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier.

Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive.",

However, since the options are separate letters, and only one needs to be chosen, perhaps C is the main point about its function (communication via pores), whereas G is more about its role as a barrier. I'm going to settle on C because it directly addresses the function involving nuclear pores.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, if the focus is solely on the structure and function, including the components like pores would make C correct. Hmm, I'm a bit torn here. Maybe I should check my notes or textbooks. From what I recall, the nuclear membrane is indeed double-layered and has nuclear pores for communication. So C would be correct regarding structure and function. As for G, it's also correct about being a barrier, but since the question is about the nuclear membrane's structure and function, C is better. Or maybe both C and G are correct, but the user wants only one letter. Since G covers both structure and function, it's more encompassing. Alternatively, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me see the original options again: C mentions two leaflets and nuclear pores, which are structural features. G states it's a rigid, impermeable barrier, which is a functional description. Depending on whether the question emphasizes structure or function, either could be correct. But given the options, I'll go with C because it directly addresses the structure and function in terms of components.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, if the question is about the membrane itself, then C is better. Wait, looking again, the question is asking what the nuclear membrane consists of, including its structure and function. So both parts are important. But the user instruction was to select one letter, implying only one correct answer. Maybe I should reconsider. The nuclear membrane is a double-layered structure with nuclear pores. So C is correct regarding its components. G talks about its role as a barrier, which is another aspect. Since the question includes both structure and function, and both C and G cover different aspects, but the user wants a single letter. Perhaps the best fit is C because it directly addresses the structure and function points: two layers and nuclear pores for communication. Alternatively, G covers the role as a barrier, which is significant. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check the options again. Option C says two leaflets with nuclear pores for cytoplasmic communication. That's correct. Option G says it's a rigid, impermeable barrier.

Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. Alternatively, C directly addresses components. Since the question includes 'function,' maybe C is better because it lists specific aspects of the function related to nuclear communication. Therefore, I'll go with C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
