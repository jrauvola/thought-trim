    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I need to answer this question about the nuclear membrane. Let me think through each option carefully. First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description.

Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus.

First, the question asks which statement correctly describes the structure and function of the nuclear membrane. There are options from A to J, but since it's multiple-choice and I'm supposed to pick one letter, maybe only one option is correct. Let me go through them: A. Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable.

Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores.

However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description. Alternatively, sometimes questions ask about specific aspects. Wait, another thought: the nuclear membrane is indeed double-layered, so C is correct in that aspect. Also, it has nuclear pores, so C includes that. But then, G is also correct in stating it's a barrier. Perhaps the most comprehensive answer is G because it covers both the structure and function, whereas C only partially does so. Alternatively, since the question is about the structure and function, both parts are covered in G. But maybe the user wants the main characteristic\u2014the barrier.

Nuclear membrane functions independently of ER and Golgi. Hmm, I don't think they're independent because both are involved in transporting materials within the nucleus. So probably wrong. B. Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description.

E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus.

Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate.

However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements.

Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components.

Alternatively, sometimes questions ask about specific aspects. Maybe the best approach is to see which options are clearly correct based on standard knowledge. From what I recall, the nuclear membrane is indeed a double-layer structure (so C is partially correct), and it has nuclear pores for nuclear-cytoplasmic communication. It is a rigid, impermeable barrier (G). Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so D is incorrect.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate.

H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description. Alternatively, sometimes questions ask about specific aspects. Given that, perhaps C is more about the composition, while G is about the function as a barrier. But the question combines both structure and function. Hmm, this is a bit tricky. To make sure, I'll recall that the nuclear membrane has two layers, a double layer, and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a double-layer structure surrounding the nucleus. Therefore, G correctly describes it as a rigid, impermeable barrier. While C describes its components, including the nuclear pores, which are important for nuclear communication. So, perhaps both are correct, but the question is asking for a single-letter answer. Given that, I think the primary description is about the barrier aspect, making G the correct choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus.

Single-leaflet structure? I remember that the nuclear membrane is double-leafed, right? So B might be incorrect. C. Two membranes with nuclear pores for communication. Yes, I believe nuclear pores allow communication between the nucleus and cytoplasm, so C sounds correct. D. Chlorophyll for photosynthesis. No, chloroplasts have chlorophyll, not the nuclear membrane. So D is out. E. Single layer fusing with ER. I think the nuclear envelope is more than just one layer; it has other structures too. E seems wrong. F. Free of pores. Definitely not. Pores are part of the nuclear membrane. F is incorrect. G. Rigid, impermeable barrier around nucleus. That makes sense because it keeps the nucleus together without letting things inside escape. G seems correct. H. Completely permeable. No, the nuclear membrane is selective, not fully permeable. H is wrong. I. Disassembles during division. Not true; the nuclear envelope reforms after division. I is wrong. J. Disassembles and isn't re-formed. Also false as mentioned earlier. So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description.

So now I'm left with C and G. Both seem plausible. Wait, let me confirm. The nuclear membrane consists of two layers (double membrane) and has nuclear pores for nuclear communication. Chlorophyll is in chloroplasts, so G is also correct. But wait, the question is about the nuclear membrane itself, not chloroplasts. So G would describe the nuclear membrane being a barrier, while C talks about its components\u2014pores. Looking back at the options, perhaps both C and G are correct, but since I can only choose one, I need to decide which is more accurate. The question specifically says \"nuclear membrane,\" so focusing on its structure and function. It does have two layers and nuclear pores for communication. However, the function could also include being a barrier, making G more comprehensive. But considering each option individually, both C and G could be correct statements. Wait, but looking again, the options are separate choices. Maybe only one is intended. Let me check my notes or textbook knowledge. Wait, actually, I think the nuclear membrane is a double-layer structure with nuclear pores for nuclear communication. It's a rigid, impermeable barrier, so G is correct. Meanwhile, C is also correct regarding the two layers and pores. But if I have to choose between C and G, perhaps G is better because it directly addresses the structure and function as stated in the question. Alternatively, C highlights the components. Hmm, perhaps the best way is to consider what each option states. Option C mentions two leaflets with nuclear pores, which are key features. Option G states it's a barrier, which is also accurate. Since I can only pick one, and given that both are correct, but likely the primary focus is on the barriers, so G might be the intended answer. Or maybe C is the structural description. Alternatively, sometimes questions ask about specific aspects. Wait, the user provided an initial answer with G as correct. Let me see: the assistant initially answered G as correct, thinking it was the nuclear membrane being a barrier. So perhaps that's the intended choice.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",
