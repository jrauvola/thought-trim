  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out why the neurotransmitter travels unidirectionally from the presynaptic axon to the postsynaptic dendrite. Let me think about what I know about synapses and neurotransmitters.\n\nFirst, when a neurotransmitter is released into the synaptic vesicles, it needs to be sent to the correct place. If it goes the other way, like from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic, that wouldn't make sense because the signal should go down the axon. So maybe the presynaptic area doesn't send anything there. But wait, some experiments show that sometimes neurotransmitters do get sent back, but they have different effects. That's probably where option J comes in\u2014dendrites release a different neurotransmitter that negates the effect.\n\nBut the main reason is probably something else. I remember something about the cell bodies or the sites where neurotransmitters are stored. Maybe if the presynaptic neurons don't have enough vesicles, the neurotransmitters might just stay inside the axon instead of being sent out. So option C says neurotransmitters are only present in the axonal end, which makes sense because if they're inside, they can't leave without signaling.\n\nAlso, the postsynaptic neurons probably don't have the machinery to take up neurotransmitters unless they've been signaled before. So if the neurotransmitters are only in the axon, they can be released when needed. That would fit with option H, where the neurotransmitter is present in the dendrites. Wait, no, H says dendrites pump it back, so maybe the presence in the axon allows them to be sent out.\n\nSo putting it together, the correct answer must be either C or F. Option C is about the neurotransmitters being in the axonal end, allowing them to exit. Option F suggests degradation right away, but I think neurotransmitters usually persist longer than that. Also, F isn't one of the options; looking back, E is about axonal terminals not releasing, but that's more about the mechanism rather than the result.\n\nWait, another thought: the release process itself requires certain signals. If the axon terminals can't release, then neurotransmitters can't move. So option E says axonal terminals lack machinery, which could prevent neurotransmitter release. But does that mean they don't release? Or does it stop their movement? Hmm, maybe the terminal cells themselves aren't active in sending neurotransmitters, but the vesicles have to be released somehow.\n\nLooking again, the options: A is about electrical signals leading to release. B talks about receptor placement. D is about vesicle location. G mentions dendritic presence. H is about the vesicle being in the dendrite.\n\nThe most likely reasoning is that neurotransmitters are only available in the axon ends (C) because if they were in the postsynaptic areas, the postsynaptics might not handle them properly. Alternatively, the absence of release mechanisms in the axon terminals could prevent neurotransmitters from being sent out.\n\nWait, but if the axon terminals can't release, then perhaps they don't receive neurotransmitters, making the neurotransmitters inaccessible elsewhere. So the correct explanation is probably that the neurotransmitters are stored in the axon end, allowing them to be released as needed. So option C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",
