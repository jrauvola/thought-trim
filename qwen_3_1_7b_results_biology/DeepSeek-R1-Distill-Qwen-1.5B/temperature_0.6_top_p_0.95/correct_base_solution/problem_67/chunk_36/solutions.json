Hmm, I'm a bit confused here. Let me check the definitions again. Flipper of an acetacean\u2014yes, that's a common flapping structure in birds and some marine mammals. Wing of a butterfly\u2014well, butterflies do have wings, but they're larger and more specialized. So maybe A is the better choice because it's a more general homologous structure, while C is specific. Since the question doesn't specify, but likely wants a general similarity, A is probably correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me consider all options. Option F: Dorsal fin of a shark. Sharks have fins, but they're adapted for swimming and eating, not flight. So probably not. Option G: Shell of a turtle. Turtles have shells, but not specifically related to flight. Option H: Horn of a rhinoceros. Horns are used for defense, not flight. Option I: Hindlimb of an elephant. Elephants have hindpaws, but that's for walking, not flying. Option J: Tail of a beaver. Beavers have tails for swimming, not flight. Option K: Not listed here. Wait, no, the options go up to J. So between A and C, but the question is about homologous to a bird's wing. If a bird's wing is similar to a flipper, then A is the answer. But C is the wing itself. Wait, the question is asking for an anatomical structure, not necessarily a wing. So maybe both A and C could be correct, but the options don't allow multiple letters. Since the user wants only one letter, perhaps A is the better choice because it's a broader term. Alternatively, C is the specific structure that's homologous to the bird's wing. Maybe the answer is C. Wait, I'm getting myself confused. Let me try to remember: Birds have wings called frills, which are similar to the flipper. So the correct answer should be A. Alternatively, C is just the wing. So perhaps the answer is C because it's the wing itself, but that's too specific. No, wait, the question is about being homologous to the wing of a bird, so the wing itself would be the homologous structure. Therefore, the answer should be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, but the way the options are structured, each is a separate option. So perhaps the intended answer is A, the flipper, because it's a type of wing structure found in some birds like eagles. Alternatively, C is the wing of a butterfly, which is homologous to a bird's wing. Maybe the best answer is C because it directly refers to a homologous structure. Wait, no, the question is asking for the structure that is homologous to the bird's wing, so the wing itself is a homologous structure. But that's too direct. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A because it's a type of wing structure, even if it's in a different animal. I'm a bit confused here. Maybe I should consider that the wings are the homologous structures. So the answer would be C because it's a homologous structure. Wait, no, because C is the wing of a butterfly, which is homologous to a bird's wing. But the question is about the wing of a bird, so maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure. I'm getting mixed up. Perhaps the correct answer is A, the flipper of an acetacean, because it's a type of wing structure, similar to a bird's wing. Alternatively, C is the wing of a butterfly, which is homologous to a bird's wing. Since the options are separate, maybe the answer is C. But the question is about the wing of a bird, so perhaps the answer is C because it's a homologous structure. I'm not sure, but I'll go with C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, no, the user provided all the options, so I should pick one. The question is asking for the homologous structure, so it's likely the wings themselves. Therefore, the wing of a butterfly (Option C) would be homologous to the bird's wing. Or maybe the flipper (Option A). Since both are related, perhaps the best answer is A, as it refers to a similar structural feature. Alternatively, C is more direct because it's the wings themselves.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Maybe the answer is C because it's specifically the wing of a butterfly, which is homologous to the bird's wing. Or perhaps the question is simpler, just choosing the wings' structural component, so A.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, maybe the best answer is C, the wing of a butterfly, because it's directly homologous. But wait, the question is asking for the wing of a bird, so perhaps it's referring to the structure within birds, not across all animals. In that case, A would make sense. But I'm a bit confused now. Let me try to recall. Wings are a structural feature, so any structural feature homologous would be a good candidate. The wings themselves are a structure, so the wing of a butterfly is homologous. Similarly, the flipper is homologous to a bird's wings. But the question specifies the wing of a bird, so maybe it's specifically about the bird's own wing. Therefore, among the options, C is the wing of a butterfly, which is homologous to the bird's wing. But wait, the question is phrased as \"of the following anatomical structures, which is homologous to the wing of a bird?\" So it's about the structure corresponding to the bird's wing. So perhaps the answer is C because it's the same kind of structure. Alternatively, A could be correct because it's a similar structure. Hmm, maybe I should consider both A and C. But since the user asked for a single letter, maybe the intended answer is C. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is A, thinking of the flipper as analogous to the bird's wing.

So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should consider each option.\n\nOption A: Flipper of an acetonacean. Flippers are found in various animals, including some birds. So yes, they can serve a similar function as a bird's wing.\n\nOption B: Antennae of a butterfly. Not related to flight; uses sound for communication.\n\nOption C: Wing of a butterfly. This is directly similar to the bird's wing, just for butterflies.\n\nOption D: Hindlimb of an elephant. Elephants have hindpaws, not wings.\n\nOption E: Forelimb of a crocodile. Crocodiles use paws for moving through water, not wings.\n\nOption F: Dorsal fin of a shark. Sharks have fins for swimming, not flight.\n\nOption G: Shell of a turtle. The shell provides protection, not flight.\n\nOption H: Horn of a rhinoceros. Horns protect the head, not flight.\n\nOption I: Hindlimb of a kangaroo. Kangaroos use tarsus for jumping, not wings.\n\nOption J: Tail of a beaver. Beavers have tails for sheltering, not flight.\n\nSo, between A and C, both are possible. But the question asks for a structure homologous to a bird's wing, which would make sense for A being a general term for wings in other animals, and C being a specific instance. Since the options are independent, both might seem correct, but likely A is intended because it's a more general term. However, sometimes questions expect the most direct match. So, C is a specific example, while A is a broader concept. Therefore, the answer might be C.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm, I'm a bit confused now. Let me check the options again.\n\nWait, the options are:\n\nA. Flipper of an acetacean\n\nB. Antennae of a butterfly\n\nC. Wing of a butterfly\n\nD. Hindlimb of an elephant\n\nE. Forelimb of a crocodile\n\nF. Dorsal fin of a shark\n\nG. Shell of a turtle\n\nH. Horn of a rhinoceros\n\nI. Hindlimb of a kangaroo\n\nJ. Tail of a beaver\n\nSo, the question is asking which anatomical structure is homologous to the wing of a bird. The wings of birds are similar to the wings of other animals. So, the flipper (A) is a similar structure, found in some birds and other marine animals. The wing of a butterfly (C) is similar to the bird's wing but specific to butterflies. Since the question is about a general homologous structure, perhaps A is the best answer because it's a similar structure to the bird's wings, even though it's called a flipper. Alternatively, C is a specific case, but the question doesn't specify whether it needs to be a general structure or just a possible example.\n\nBut wait, the user mentioned \"answer with only a single letter,\" implying there's one correct answer. Given that, perhaps the intended answer is A because it's a homologous structure (flipper) compared to the bird's wings, whereas the wing itself is C. Or maybe the answer is C because it's specifically a homologous structure. I'm a bit torn here. In biology, both flipper and wing are examples of homologous structures, but the question refers to the wing of a bird, so perhaps the answer is A because it's a similar structure. Alternatively, C is more accurate because it's the wing itself. I think the best choice is A because it's a homologous structure related to the bird's wings.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out which anatomical structure in the options is homologous to the wing of a bird. Let me break this down. First, what does \"homologous\" mean? It means that two structures are similar because they evolved from a common ancestor. So, if something's homologous to another, it probably has a similar function and shape. The question is about the wing of a bird. Birds have wings for flying, right? The wing is part of their respiratory system. So, looking at the options: Option A: Flipper of an acetacean. Acetaceans include birds like eagles and ducks. Their flipper is used for flapping, similar to how birds flap their wings. That seems relevant. Option B: Antennae of a butterfly. Those are for communication, not flight. So probably not homologous to a bird's wing. Option C: Wing of a butterfly. Wait, that's exactly the same as option A but for butterflies instead of birds. But since the question is about birds, maybe it's still relevant because both have wings. Wait, the question says \"of the following anatomical structures,\" so maybe both A and C could be correct depending on whether we're considering different species. But perhaps the answer expects one option. Maybe the main point is the wing itself, so either could be considered. But let me think again. The wing of a bird is similar to the wings of other animals. Flippers (like in A) are common in many marine animals, including birds. Butterflies also have wings, though those are specialized. So maybe A and C are both correct. However, the question asks to choose one letter, implying there's only one correct answer. Looking back, the options are separate, so perhaps only one structure is homologous. If A is a flipper, which is a type of wing-like structure, then it might fit. Alternatively, C is the wing itself, but that's more specific. Wait, the original question is about \"the wing of a bird.\" So perhaps the homologous structure would be a wings-like feature. So maybe A or C. But the options don't list a wings structure except A and C. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because it's a similar structure to the bird's wing. Or C because it's a homologous pair. Hmm. The user wants a single letter answer, so likely one option. Since A and C are both possible, perhaps the intended answer is A, as it refers to a flipper, which is analogous to a bird's wing. Alternatively, C is the exact homologous structure. I'm a bit confused here. Let me check each option again:\n\n- A: Flipper \u2013 similar to bird's wing.\n- B: Antennae \u2013 for communication.\n- C: Wing \u2013 exact homologous.\n- D: Hindlimb of an elephant \u2013 trunk/hind leg, not related.\n- E: Forelimb of a crocodile \u2013 similar to bird hindlimb, but not wings.\n- F: Dorsal fin of a shark \u2013 similar to bird fin, but not wings.\n- G: Shell of a turtle \u2013 not related.\n- H: Horn of a rhinoceros \u2013 for defense, not flight.\n- I: Hindlimb of a kangaroo \u2013 trunk/hind leg, not wings.\n- J: Tail of a beaver \u2013 tail structure, not wings.\n\nSo between A and C, both could be correct.
