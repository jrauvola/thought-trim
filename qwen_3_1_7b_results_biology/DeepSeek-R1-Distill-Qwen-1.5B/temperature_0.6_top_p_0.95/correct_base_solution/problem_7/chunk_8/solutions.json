Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, if the label decays, it'll tell you when the original compound was present. That sounds like it could help trace pathways because you'd see where the label moves as the molecules change.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Labels are a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways and applicable elsewhere.\nB. Used for food flavor and texture\u2014probably not related to biological research.\nC.

First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. So when analyzing the sample later, you can see if specific compounds are present or absent based on whether the label is still there. That helps identify what's happening in the cell\u2014like whether a pathway is active or not. \n\nLooking at the options, option B talks about using radioactive isotopes for food flavoring, which doesn't fit. Option C mentions stimulating the immune system, which isn't directly related to biological pathways of synthesis. Option D focuses on oxygen-carrying capacity, not specifically pathways. Option E is about enhancing crops, again unrelated. Option F says they're used as a direct nutrient supplement. While some isotopes like cobalt-64 are used for supplements, they aren't primarily for that purpose but rather for metabolism. Option G suggests creating glow-in-the-dark materials, which I know uses ionized molecules, not necessarily isotopes. Option H is about providing energy for spacecraft, which is entirely unrelated. Option I relates to killing cancer cells, which is more toxicological than biological labeling. Lastly, option J uses radioactive isotopes for dating samples, which is another application beyond labeling pathways.\n\nPutting it all together, the most accurate answer should be option B. Even though they aren't mainly for flavoring, the concept of labeling and tracking is similar. Alternatively, option I could be considered, but it's more about dating rather than tracing pathways. Since the question asks specifically about tracing metabolic pathways, option B fits better because labeling allows identification of compounds formed during synthesis.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Radioactive isotopes are used for dating archaeological samples.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. So, if you start with a compound in a living cell and track its formation over time using radioisotopes, you can see where it comes from. That would help in understanding metabolic pathways. \n\nLooking at the options now:\n\nA. Labels are powerful for studying metabolic pathways and various areas. This seems like a good fit because labeling allows you to track changes over time and identify sources, which traces pathways effectively.\nB. Uses for food and flavor? No, that's unrelated to biological research or pathfinding.\nC. Stimulates the immune system? Not really; immune response is more about recognizing threats rather than tagging molecules.\nD. Increase oxygen-carrying capacity? That sounds more like an engineering application, not radioactive isotopes.\nE. Enhance crops? Again, not directly related to tagging or tracking.\nF. Directly as a nutrient? While nutrients are important, it's not the primary use of radioisotopes here.\nG. Glow-in-the-dark materials? Maybe, but again, not the main purpose.\nH. Energy for spacecraft? Definitely unrelated.\nI. Kill cancer cells? That's a medical application, not lab technique.\nJ. Date artifacts? No, dating usually involves methods like carbon-14 decay.\n\nSo, narrowing it down, option A stands out because it clearly mentions labeling and tracking metabolic pathways, which aligns perfectly with how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research. Other options either pertain to different applications (like enhancing nutrients) or don't touch upon the core functionality of labeling for pathway tracing.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

G sounds like it's creating glow materials, which might involve some radiation but isn't exactly labeling. H is about spacecraft energy, irrelevant context. I and J relate to dating and killing cancer cells, neither of which ties into labeling or pathway tracing.\n\nSo putting it together, option A fits best because radioactive labeling allows us to track metabolic pathways efficiently across various biological studies without needing immediate detection of all changes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. This allows scientists to track where compounds come from or go to within a cell or organism. So that ties into metabolic pathways because it would help identify the origin of each metabolite. \n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA. Seems correct because it mentions labeling with radioactive isotopes to study metabolic pathways and other areas. That fits what I was thinking earlier.\n\nB. Doesn't seem right because radioactive isotopes aren't used to improve food taste or texture. That might be something else entirely, like enhancing flavor through chemical processes, not radioactivity.\n\nC. Also doesn't fit because stimulating the immune system directly isn't a common application of radioisotopes. It's more related to immune response mechanisms rather than labeling or tracking.\n\nD. Improving oxygen-carrying capacity... Hmm, maybe in some cases, but I recall that labeling is more about tracking where things go rather than directly increasing oxygen levels.\n\nE. Enhancing crop growth\u2014maybe, but again, that sounds more like a physical process rather than using labeling.\n\nF. As a direct nutrient supplement\u2014I don't think that's the primary use of radioisotopes. They\u2019re more about labeling than providing nutrients directly.\n\nG. Creating glow-in-the-dark materials... Maybe in some specialized applications, but not the main purpose when it comes to labeling.\n\nH. Providing energy for spacecraft\u2014definitely unrelated. Spacecraft rely on batteries, which are usually non-radioactive.\n\nI. Killing cancer cells\u2014radiation therapy does that, but labeling is a different mechanism altogether.\n\nJ. Dating ancient samples\u2014While radioactive isotopes do age things exponentially, the primary use isn't labeling specific compounds over time. They're more about establishing timelines rather than pinpointing exact compounds.\n\nSo, putting it all together, option A seems to best describe how radioactive isotopes are used to label substances, thereby enabling the tracking of metabolic pathways and other biological processes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

It's like creating a map of where things are moving\u2014so if you want to study pathways, using labeled isotopes would help identify these movements without needing to know exactly what each molecule is composed of beforehand. \n\nLooking at the options now:\n\nA. Seems good because it mentions tracking metabolic pathways and various biological research areas.\nB. No, radioactive isotopes aren't used for improving food taste or texture; that's more of a culinary application.\nC. Not related to immune systems; those are usually addressed with vaccines or anti-inflammatory medications.\nD. Oxygen-carrying capacity isn't the primary goal when using radioisotopes in metabolism.\nE. Agricultural crops? Maybe for stress responses or something, but not the main purpose.\nF. Direct nutrients supplement? I don't recall that being the main role of radioisotopes in pathway studies.\nG. Glow-in-the-dark materials? That's more of a scientific tool application rather than pathfinding.\nH. Energy for spacecraft? Definitely unrelated to biological processes.\nI. Killing cancer cells? That's more about treatment rather than measurement.\nJ. Dating ancient samples? Radiocarbon dating is a common method here, but the key aspect is tracking through metabolism.\n\nSo, option A fits best because it directly addresses the use of radioactive isotopes in biological research, specifically in tracing metabolic pathways. It emphasizes their versatility across various fields within biology, which aligns perfectly with the question's focus.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, if the original compound decays or breaks down, its label remains attached, allowing researchers to see where it went. So this must help in mapping pathways because you can track where the radioisotopes end up. Looking at the options, option A says labeling is a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways, which sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Then there are some other options too, but they seem less likely. For example, B talks about food products, which isn't related to biological research. C and D mention the immune system and oxygen-carrying capacity, neither of which connects directly to tracing pathways in living cells. E and F relate to agriculture and nutrition supplements, again not relevant. G mentions glow-in-the-dark materials, which doesn't apply here. H is about space travel, unrelated. I and J are about dating and killing cells, which aren't part of the application described. So putting it all together, option A fits best because labeling with radioactive isotopes allows tracking of metabolic pathways efficiently.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. This way, scientists can track where molecules come from or go to. That aligns with the idea of \"tracing pathways\" in biological processes. \n\nLooking at the options now:\n\nA. Labels substances with isotopes, useful for metabolic pathways and other areas.\nB. Used for improving food taste and texture \u2013 doesn't fit.\nC. Stimulate the immune system \u2013 not related to biological research specifically.\nD. Increase oxygen-carrying capacity \u2013 irrelevant context.\nE. Enhance agricultural crops \u2013 unrelated to biological studies.\nF. As a direct supplement for animals \u2013 more of a nutritional supplement role.\nG. Create glow-in-the-dark materials \u2013 again, unrelated to biological applications.\nH. Provide energy for spacecraft \u2013 space-related, not biological.\nI. Kill cancer cells \u2013 medical application, not research.\nJ. Date archaeological samples \u2013 historical use, not relevant here.\n\nSo, focusing on option A, it seems like the best choice. It mentions labeling with isotopes for metabolic pathways and general biological uses, which fits perfectly with what the question is asking. Other options either pertain to non-biological contexts or incorrect roles within biological research. Therefore, A is the most accurate answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

So perhaps J is more precise because it's about dating and thus understanding the process. Alternatively, A is more general but still applies since some applications include dating.

Maybe the intended correct answer is J, even though it's about dating rather than labeling. Alternatively, maybe another option better fits. Let me reconsider. Labeling allows scientists to track compounds' movement through a pathway by detecting where the radioactive label ends up. This technique helps identify intermediates and bottlenecks in metabolic pathways. Therefore, among the given options, the most accurate choice would be J, as it involves labeling substances to study pathways, even if it's more about dating. Or perhaps another option? Let me check again. Option I is about killing cancer cells, which is treatment, not labeling. Option G is about glow-in-the-dark materials, which uses radioactivity differently. Option A talks about a powerful method for specific pathways and other areas. That seems plausible because radioactive labeling is effective for studying various processes. So, maybe A is the best choice. It states that labeling is powerful for specific pathways and others. Since the question asks about biological research for tracing pathways, A fits well because it emphasizes its versatility across different applications.

So, when scientists study these compounds, they can track where the radioactive material ends up, indicating the pathway it was part of. That fits with using radioactive isotopes in biological research. Now, looking at the answer choices, option B says radioactive isotopes improve food flavor and texture, but that doesn't seem right because labeling isn't about taste or texture improvement. Option C talks about stimulating the immune system, which again sounds more like a medical application rather than biological research for pathways. Option D mentions increasing oxygen-carrying capacity, which might relate to metabolism but not specifically pathway tracing. Option E is about enhancing crop growth, which could be related to nutrition but not directly about labeling. Option F suggests using them as nutrient supplements for animals, which is another medical application. Option G is creating glow-in-the-dark materials, which uses radioactivity in a different way, probably for decoration rather than research purposes. Option H is providing energy for spacecrafts, which is unrelated. Option I is killing cancer cells, which is a treatment application. Option J says they're used for dating ancient samples, which ties into radiometric dating methods used in archaeology and geology, similar to radioactive labeling. But wait, the question is about tracing pathways in living cells, not dating ancient samples. So option J might be more about age determination than pathfinding. Then there's option K, which isn't listed here. Wait, the options go up to J, so perhaps none of them perfectly fit. However, considering the closest match, option J deals with dating, which isn't exactly about labeling for pathways. Maybe the intended correct answer is J, even though it's about dating rather than labeling. Alternatively, maybe another option better fits. Let me reconsider. Labeling allows scientists to track compounds' movement through a pathway by detecting where the radioactive label ends up. This technique helps identify intermediates and bottlenecks in metabolic pathways. Therefore, among the given options, the most accurate choice would be J, as it involves labeling substances to study pathways, even if it's more about dating. Or perhaps another option? Let me check again. Option I is about killing cancer cells, which is treatment, not labeling. Option G is about glow-in-the-dark materials, which uses radioactivity differently. Option A talks about a powerful method for specific pathways and other areas. That seems plausible because radioactive labeling is effective for studying various processes. So, maybe A is the best choice. It states that labeling is powerful for specific pathways and others. Since the question asks about biological research for tracing pathways, A fits well because it emphasizes its versatility across different applications. Even though J is about dating, it's still relevant because labeling is a key tool in biological studies. So, between A and J, A seems more appropriate.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, if the original compound is broken down or transformed, the radioactive label should indicate where it came from. So this could help trace pathways. \n\nLooking at the options, option A says labeling is a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways and applies to many areas. That fits what I was thinking earlier. Option B talks about improving food flavor, which doesn't seem related to biological research on cellular processes. C mentions stimulating the immune system, again unrelated. D is about increasing oxygen-carrying capacity in blood, which relates more to physiological aspects rather than labeling. E is about enhancing crop growth, still not directly connected. F suggests using them as direct nutrients, but that's more about feeding than labeling. G is about creating glow-in-the-dark materials, which isn't about labeling. H uses them for spacecraft energy, which is more about energy production than labeling. I discusses killing cancer cells, another medical application, not labeling. J is about dating ancient samples, which involves radiometric dating techniques, not labeling. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the key points are labeling allowing tracking of changes over time, applying it to metabolic pathways, and being effective across various fields. Therefore, option A seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Option H is about providing energy for spacecrafts, which doesn't make sense. Option I is about killing cancer cells, but isotopes wouldn't be used that way. Finally, option J suggests dating ancient samples using isotopes. Wait, I remember something about carbon-14 being used for radiocarbon dating, which does involve isotopes. But was it for life cycles or for something else? Carbon-14 is used for organic molecules like proteins and DNA, helping date things up to around 5300 years old. So maybe J is correct. But wait, earlier I thought about labeling for metabolic pathways. Hmm, now I'm confused between J and another option. Let me go back. The key point is tracking the pathway of synthesized compounds. So if you label the starting material, you can track where each subsequent molecule comes from. That helps in understanding the biochemical pathways. But none of the options specifically say \"labeling for metabolic pathways.\" However, option J is about dating samples, which involves isotopes but isn't exactly about tracking pathways. Maybe I'm mixing concepts here. Alternatively, perhaps option J is referring to a different technique. Wait, no, option J is about dating, which uses isotopes for that. So maybe the answer is J because isotopes are used for dating, even though it's a bit different from tracing pathways. Or perhaps I missed another option.

Option E about crops. Option D about oxygen. Option C about immune systems. Option B about flavor. Option A about metabolic pathways. Oh! Option A says labeling helps study specific metabolic pathways. That aligns perfectly with what I was thinking earlier.

Similarly, C and D discuss other areas like immune systems and nutrient support, which aren't directly related to pathfinding in living cells. E is about agriculture, too vague. F is about animal diets, again unrelated. G is about glow-in-the-dark materials, which doesn't fit. H is space travel, irrelevant. I is about cancer, which isn't addressed by the question. J is about dating samples, which involves radiometric dating methods but not the labeling itself.\n\nSo yes, A seems solid. It clearly states the application in biological research for metabolic pathway tracing. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works.

That doesn't seem right because improving taste usually involves enzymes and other chemical processes, not radioactive isotopes. Option C talks about stimulating the immune system, which again sounds unrelated to tracking compounds in living cells. Option D mentions increasing oxygen-carrying capacity, which would relate more to biochemical reactions rather than labeling. Option E is about enhancing agricultural crops, which is definitely outside the scope of biological research on pathways. Option F says they're used as a direct nutrient supplement in animals' diets. While they do help with metabolism, it's not about tracking pathways in living cells. Option G is about glow-in-the-dark materials, which doesn't fit either. Option H is about providing energy for spacecrafts, which isn't related to biological studies. Option I is about killing cancer cells, another unrelated application. Option J suggests using them for dating ancient samples, like in archaeology. That's a bit off too\u2014most dating methods involve radiometric decay, but labeling is still important there. Finally, option K (if it were present) might refer to reducing waste or something, but none of the given options match what I know about labeling isotopes for pathway tracing.

But based on my analysis, option B doesn't fit, so maybe the correct choice is something else. Let me reconsider. Option J refers to dating, which uses isotopes to determine age, but labeling isn't exactly dating itself. Alternatively, perhaps none of the options perfectly capture the intended meaning, but the closest is option B, even though I'm uncertain. However, upon reevaluation, I realize that labeling isotopes is indeed crucial for tracking metabolic pathways in living cells, making option B incorrect. Therefore, none of the options perfectly describe the use, but if forced to choose, maybe none. Wait, no\u2014the initial problem states \"answer with only a single letter,\" implying one option is correct. Given that, perhaps the best fit is option B despite doubts? Or am I missing something? Maybe option J is about dating, but labeling is part of it. Alternatively, perhaps none, but since the instruction requires selecting one, I must choose the most fitting. After careful consideration, option B isn't correct because it's about improving food, which isn't relevant. Instead, option J is about dating, which does use isotopes, but it's a separate process. Hmm. Perhaps the best fit among the options is option B, but I'm unsure. Alternatively, maybe none, but the user expects an answer.

Upon reflection, radioactive isotopes are indeed used for tracking metabolic pathways in living cells, so option B, though incorrect, might be the closest.

Radioactive isotopes are used for dating archaeological samples.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, if the original compound breaks down, the label should remain attached until the decomposition rate matches the decay of the isotope. That process helps determine when the breakdown happened. So, maybe option B is talking about labeling but incorrectly saying they're used for food improvement, which doesn't make sense. Option C mentions stimulating the immune system, but I recall that labeling is more about tracking, not directly causing immune responses. Option D talks about increasing oxygen-carrying capacity, which relates to hemoglobin or something else, but again, that's more about biochemical processes rather than labeling. Option E is about enhancing agricultural crops, which ties into yield, not specifically labeling. Option F says they're used as a direct nutrient supplement. Wait, isn't that what labeled compounds do? You give them extra nutrients via labeling instead of delivering them directly. Option G suggests creating glow-in-the-dark materials, which I know is done using radioactive materials like strontium-90, not labeling itself. Option H is about providing energy for spacecraft, which is unrelated. Option I is about killing cancer cells, which is another application, though not exactly labeling. Option J mentions dating ancient samples, which uses radiocarbon, but I'm thinking about labeling first. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main idea is labeling to track changes over time. Therefore, among the options, J fits best because it's about labeling, which is indeed used in biological research. All the others either don't address labeling or mix up labeling with other applications.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. So, if you study the formation of a pathway, you'd look for where the radioactive label ends up\u2014probably on the end product. That would help track where things go in the pathway. Now, considering the options, option A says labeling is a powerful method for studying metabolic pathways and applies to various fields. That sounds exactly like what I was thinking. Option B talks about food flavor and texture, which doesn't fit. C mentions stimulating the immune system, but I know labeling isn't directly related to immune response. D and E are about oxygen-carrying and crop growth, which doesn't seem right either. F is about animal diets, which again doesn't fit. G is glow-in-the-dark materials, not sure why. H is energy for spacecraft, way off. I and J relate to archaeology and cancer, which aren't connected to biological pathways.\n\nSo, putting it all together, radioactive isotopes are labeled, observed over time, and applied across various areas in biology. That aligns perfectly with option A. I don't see any reason to choose another option because others don't address the labeling or its broader applications.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how radioactive isotopes are used in biological research to trace pathways of compounds made in living cells. The question gives me multiple-choice answers from A to J, and I need to pick just one letter that correctly describes their use. Let's break it down step by step. First, I remember that radioactive isotopes have different half-lives, which means they decay at different rates. This property makes them useful for tracking changes over time because you don't have to wait for everything to completely disappear; instead, you can detect changes after a certain period. That seems relevant here since we're looking at pathways over time. Next, I think about how labeling substances works. If you label an organic molecule with a radioactive isotope, any new compound formed will also carry that label. Over time, if there's a pathway change, like a branch or an enzyme involved, the radioactivity would move along that path. This allows researchers to see where things are going and identify what's causing changes. \n\nLooking at the options now: Option B talks about food product improvement, which doesn't seem related.
