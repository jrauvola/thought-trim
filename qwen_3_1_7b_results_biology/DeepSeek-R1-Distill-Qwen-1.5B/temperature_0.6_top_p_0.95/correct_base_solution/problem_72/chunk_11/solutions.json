That aligns with what I just thought about deletions. - Option K (not listed) probably refers to mutations causing variable responses, but since it's not an option, I'll skip. - Option L (not listed) mentions all cells recognizing antigens, which isn't correct. - Option M (not listed) about identical receptors, which is more about redundancy. - Option N (not listed) says mutations create identical receptors, which fits with variable responses. - Option O (not listed) about no differentiation, which ties back to the idea that some T-cells can't tell the difference. - Option P (not listed) reduces the immune response, which again is broader. \n\nSo, putting it together, the key points are that mutations increase the ability of T-cells to recognize foreign antigens through recombination, which enhances their function.

Therefore, the best answer should highlight that mutations enhance recognition, which contributes to rejection. Looking at the options, B and I both touch on this.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A seems incorrect. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds plausible because during maturation, T-cells become more specialized, and mutations could enhance their ability to detect foreign stuff. - Option C says mutations prevent T-cells from recognizing foreign antigens. Hmm, that would mean the T-cells don't react, but I think mutations often improve recognition, especially if they're beneficial. So C might be wrong. - Option D mentions repair of damaged T-cells. While cell repair can sometimes help, I don't think that's directly related to recognizing foreign antigens. It's more about the existing state. - Option E says mutations make all cells recognize their own antigens. No way, that's too broad. - Option F suggests mutations reduce the immune response. Again, that's more about overall immune strength rather than individual cell function. - Option G states mutations increase the chance of graft acceptance by enhancing immune tolerance. That rings a bell. Because if the T-cells can better recognize foreign things, they stick around longer, increasing the chance the graft survives. - Option H says mutations generate T-cells that can't distinguish self from non-self. That's true, but it's more about specificity rather than aiding in rejection. The main point here is that these T-cells stay longer, so the graft isn't rejected as much. - Option I claims mutations cause T-cell deletions for foreign antigens. Yes, T-cell deletions can happen due to mutations, especially if they target specific antigens. This leads them to not recognize foreign ones, thus rejecting the graft. - Option J says mutations delete T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens. That aligns with what I just thought about deletions. - Option K (not listed) probably refers to mutations causing variable responses, but since it's not an option, I'll skip. - Option L (not listed) mentions all cells recognizing antigens, which isn't correct. - Option M (not listed) about identical receptors, which is more about redundancy. - Option N (not listed) says mutations create identical receptors, which fits with variable responses. - Option O (not listed) about no differentiation, which ties back to the idea that some T-cells can't tell the difference. - Option P (not listed) reduces the immune response, which again is broader. \n\nSo, putting it together, the key points are that mutations increase the ability of T-cells to recognize foreign antigens through recombination, which enhances their function.

First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. - Option B suggests mutations happen during T-cell maturation, resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds plausible because as T-cells mature, they might undergo mutations that make them better at dealing with foreign stuff. - Option C claims mutation prevents T-cells from recognizing antigens. Hmm, but if mutation leads to recombination, wouldn't that help? Maybe I need to consider which option aligns best with what happens during T-cell development.\n- Options D to J mention repair, deletion, etc., which relate to how T-cells handle damage. But the main point here is whether mutation and recombination directly cause recognition of foreign antigens.\n- Looking back, Option B seems correct because during T-cell maturation, mutations could enhance their ability to recognize foreign antigens through recombination. This would lead to the body rejecting the graft since the immune system isn't attacking the foreign material.\nSo putting it together, the right answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question asks how mutation and recombination contribute. Mutation can introduce changes in the TCRs, either changing them (recombination) or introducing new genes (mutation). These changes could either improve or worsen the TCR's ability to bind antigens. If they improve binding, the T-cells can better fight the foreign material, increasing tolerance and accepting the graft more easily. On the flip side, if the TCRs lose their ability to recognize foreign antigens due to mutation or recombination, the T-cells will fail to attack the foreign material, leading to rejection. Therefore, the correct answers should involve either enhancement or reduction in the TCR's ability to recognize antigens. So options B and G fit this description.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So maybe A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds plausible because as T-cells mature, they have more T-cell receptors (TCRs), and mutations could make them better at recognizing foreign stuff. - Option C claims mutation prevents T-cells from recognizing antigens. That seems opposite; mutations usually enhance recognition. So probably not C. - Options D and E talk about repairing T-cells or recognizing own antigens. I don't think these directly cause rejection but might relate to overall immunity. - Options F and G mention reducing and increasing responses. I'm not sure about that. - Options H and J discuss generating T-cells unable to distinguish. That would definitely lead to rejection because they'd be ineffective against foreign antigens. - Options I and J are about identical receptors and deleting cells that can react. Identical receptors are bad because it increases variability and makes it harder for the immune system to target specific antigens. Deletion could also lead to ineffective T-cells. \n\nPutting it together, B seems correct because T-cell maturation leads to better antigen recognition through recombination, especially with mutations. Other options either don't explain the mechanism or suggest incorrect effects.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

However, the initial thought process suggested that mutations enhance recognition, so perhaps B is the correct answer because it explains the mechanism, whereas J describes the outcome.

First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A seems incorrect. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because T-cells mature into B and CD4 cells, which are supposed to detect antigens. So they would react to foreign stuff, leading to rejection. - Option C says mutation and recombination prevent recognition. That contradicts what I just thought. If recombination helps, then C is wrong. - Options D and E are about repair and identity, which don't fit the main point of recombination helping rejection. - Options F and G relate to reducing and increasing immune responses, but the question is specifically about recombination aiding rejection, not changing the overall response. - Options H and J mention deleting T-cells, which could affect the immune system, but again, the focus is on mutation and recombination. - Options I and J discuss identical receptors and deletions, which are specific to recombination. So putting it together, option B seems correct. It explains that during T-cell maturation (in the thymus), mutations and recombination cause T-cells to recognize foreign antigens, thus contributing to tissue rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A seems incorrect. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because T-cells have precursors in the thymus, and mutations might make them better at recognizing foreign stuff. - Option C suggests mutation prevents T-cells from recognizing antigens. Hmm, but if the cells are already there (as in the thymus), mutations could enhance their ability to detect them. So C might not be correct. - Option D mentions repair of damaged T-cells. I'm not sure how that directly contributes to rejection. - Option E says mutation reduces immune response. Maybe, but again, if the cells themselves can recognize foreign antigens better due to mutations, that wouldn't be about the repair. - Option F says mutation reduces the immune response. Not sure. - Option G increases tolerance. That fits because if the cells can recognize foreign antigens better, they would build up tolerance. - Option H creates T-cells that can't differentiate. That might lead to more problems, but not necessarily direct rejection. - Option I leads to deletion of T-cells that can handle foreign antigens. That makes sense too because if those T-cells are bad at it, they'd probably get deleted. - Option J causes T-cells to miss foreign antigens. Again, if the cells are mutated, they might not need to be as good at handling things. - Option K isn't listed here, but usually, mutations can enhance recognition. - Option L isn't available either. \n\nSo putting it together, option B seems to fit best.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A might be incorrect. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because once T-cells mature, they become part of the immune system. If they recognize foreign antigens, they'll target them, causing the body to reject the graft. - Option C suggests mutation prevents recognition. That seems opposite of what happens; mutations usually enhance the immune system's ability to detect threats. So C is probably wrong. - Options D and E seem unrelated to T-cells or the immune response. F and G relate to the immune response but aren't directly about T-cells' function in rejection.

    "rollout": " - Option B talks about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize antigens. That sounds relevant because after T-cells mature, they start producing antibodies. If they're mutated or recombined, those antibodies might be stronger or better at recognizing foreign stuff. - Option C says mutation and recombination prevent them from recognizing antigens. That would make T-cells ineffective against foreign stuff, probably leading to rejection. - Option D suggests repair helps T-cells, but I don't think repair directly affects recognition; it's more about fixing existing issues. - Option E is about all cells recognizing themselves. That seems unrelated because it's about foreign antigens, not self ones.\n- Option F reduces the immune response. If T-cells can't recognize foreign antigens well due to mutation, they won't attack the foreign material as much, so fewer attacks overall. That fits with tissue rejection because less damage means more chance to get accepted. \n- Option G increases the chance of acceptance by boosting tolerance. If the immune system isn't recognizing foreign antigens well (due to mutations), the body treats them as self, increasing tolerance. This could help the graft survive longer or accept better than before.\n- Option H says mutation generates T-cells that can't tell apart self and non-self. That makes sense because if they can't recognize the foreign antigen, they won't attack it effectively, leading to rejection.\n- Option I leads to deletion of T-cells meant for foreign antigens. If these cells aren't made anymore, the body has fewer effective T-cells, which might reduce the risk of rejection or cause the T-cells to lose function, perhaps even attacking the foreign stuff again.\n- Option J deletes T-cells that can handle foreign antigens. Without those, the body has weaker T-cells that can't fight foreign threats, leading to more rejection.\nSo putting it together, both mutation and recombination are key factors here. If they don't work well, T-cells can't recognize foreign antigens. This leads to the body rejecting the graft because the foreign material isn't being recognized effectively. The presence of strong T-cells (from mutations) can help mitigate this effect. Also, reduced immune response (mutation) allows the body to take other steps to deal with foreign threats, increasing chances of acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer should involve both aspects working together to either prevent or reduce the effectiveness of foreign recognition, leading to rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize antigens. That sounds relevant because after T-cells mature, they start producing antibodies. If they're mutated or recombined, those antibodies might be stronger or better at recognizing foreign stuff. - Option C says mutation and recombination prevent them from recognizing antigens. That would make T-cells ineffective against foreign stuff, probably leading to rejection. - Option D suggests repair helps T-cells, but I don't think repair directly affects recognition; it's more about fixing existing issues. - Option E is about all cells recognizing themselves. That seems unrelated because it's about foreign antigens, not self ones.\n- Option F reduces the immune response. If T-cells can't recognize foreign antigens well due to mutation, they won't attack the foreign material as much, so fewer attacks overall. That fits with tissue rejection because less damage means more chance to get accepted. \n- Option G increases the chance of acceptance by boosting tolerance. If the immune system isn't recognizing foreign antigens well (due to mutations), the body treats them as self, increasing tolerance. This could help the graft survive longer or accept better than before.\n- Option H says mutation generates T-cells that can't tell apart self and non-self. That makes sense because if they can't recognize the foreign antigen, they won't attack it effectively, leading to rejection.\n- Option I leads to deletion of T-cells meant for foreign antigens. If these cells aren't made anymore, the body has fewer effective T-cells, which might reduce the risk of rejection or cause the T-cells to lose function, perhaps even attacking the foreign stuff again.\n- Option J deletes T-cells that can handle foreign antigens. Without those, the body has weaker T-cells that can't fight foreign threats, leading to more rejection.\nSo putting it together, both mutation and recombination are key factors here. If they don't work well, T-cells can't recognize foreign antigens. This leads to the body rejecting the graft because the foreign material isn't being recognized effectively. The presence of strong T-cells (from mutations) can help mitigate this effect. Also, reduced immune response (mutation) allows the body to take other steps to deal with foreign threats, increasing chances of acceptance. Therefore, the correct answer should involve both aspects working together to either prevent or reduce the effectiveness of foreign recognition, leading to rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A seems wrong. - Option B suggests mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus lead to cells recognizing foreign antigens. That sounds plausible because as T-cells mature, they have more surface proteins and memory of past encounters. So mutations could change these, making them better at identifying foreign stuff. - Option C claims mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing antigens. That would be bad for graft rejection because the cells wouldn't handle foreign stuff well. So C isn't right either. - Option D talks about repairing damaged T-cells, but repair usually happens when T-cells are healthy, not during their development. Also, damage repair doesn't directly cause recognition of foreign antigens. So D doesn't fit. - Option E says mutation leads all cells to recognize their own antigens. No, that's too strong. Only specific cells (like T-cells) might recognize their own, others don't necessarily. - Option F mentions mutation reducing the immune response. That's possible, but it's not specifically about T-cell mediated rejection. It's a broader effect on the immune system. - Option G says mutation increases the chance of acceptance by enhancing tolerance. That makes sense because stronger immune response helps the body recognize the foreign material better. - Option H suggests mutation generates T-cells without differentiation. That's true, but it doesn't explain why the graft is rejected; it just explains resistance. - Option I says mutation causes T-cell deletions that can't handle foreign antigens. Yes, this fits because if T-cells aren't functional anymore, they won't recognize foreign stuff, leading to rejection. - Option J states mutation deletes T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens.

This is about specificity, which is important for avoiding rejection. - Option I suggests mutations lead to T-cell deletions that can't respond. Deletion reduces their ability to recognize antigens, which could decrease recognition and contribute to rejection. - Option J implies mutations cause T-cells to delete those that can handle foreign stuff. That fits with increased tolerance since fewer cells need to recognize foreign antigens. - Option K isn't listed, so probably irrelevant. - Option L isn't mentioned either. \n\nSo, putting it together: The key points are that mutations enhance T-cell function (like recombination) allowing them to better recognize foreign antigens, which then lowers their ability to attack the graft, leading to rejection. Therefore, the correct option should be G or H. But looking back, the question is asking how mutation and recombination contribute, so both would be part of the mechanism. However, the answer choices seem to present each as separate possibilities. Since the question allows only one letter, I need to pick the best fit. Both G and H are related\u2014G about increasing tolerance and H about generating poor cells. Which is more specific to the mechanism described in the question? The question mentions recombination and mutation causing better recognition, so perhaps H is more accurate because it directly states how mutations prevent recognizing foreign antigens, thereby decreasing the immune response needed for rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A might be wrong. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds relevant because T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could change them to better recognize antigens. This would make the T-cells more effective against the foreign material, aiding in rejection. - Option C suggests mutation prevents T-cells from recognizing antigens, which seems opposite of what B says.

This means they become more effective at attacking the foreign material, causing them to reject the graft. Also, increased tolerance (G) because the body has a stronger immune response.

If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So A might be incorrect. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because during T-cell development, they start recognizing foreign stuff, and mutations might make them better at it. - Option C suggests mutation and recombination prevent recognition, but that seems opposite; if you mutate them, they should recognize better. So C is probably wrong. - Options D, E, F, G, H, I, J relate to repair or cell behavior. Wait, D says mutations repair damaged T-cells. No, repair would involve fixing issues, not mutating. E talks about all cells recognizing antigens, which isn't true since only specific cells (like B and T) do that. F reduces immune response, which is part of why rejection happens. G increases tolerance, so that's correct. H creates identical receptors, reducing variability\u2014maybe helpful but not directly causing rejection. I leads to deletions of T-cells that can handle foreign antigens, meaning those T-cells wouldn't work against the foreign stuff. J says mutations delete T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens, so after deleting, those T-cells won't help with the foreign material. Putting it together, the most accurate answer would be B because it correctly states that mutations during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, thus contributing to rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because during T-cell development, especially in the thymus, they undergo recombination, which could enhance their ability to detect foreign stuff. - Option C suggests mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing antigens. Hmm, but if they're recognized, then they wouldn't cause rejection. So C seems incorrect. - Options D to J are also about T-cells, either helping them recognize better or causing issues with them. But the question specifically asks how these mutations affect rejection, so focusing on B and C. Between B and C, B seems to directly address the mechanism of T-cells being recognized after recombination, while C is opposite. So I think B is the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't correct. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That sounds right because once T-cells mature, they have the ability to recognize any antigen, including foreign ones. This would allow them to target foreign pathogens, increasing the risk of rejection. - Option C says mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing antigens. That contradicts what I know because mutations usually help the immune system recognize things better. - Option D mentions repairing damaged T-cells, but I don't think repair directly causes recognition of foreign antigens. It might improve existing responses, but not necessarily cause the need for reactivity. - Option E suggests everyone recognizes their own antigens, which is true but doesn't explain why someone else wouldn't. - Options F through H deal with varying immune responses or generating specific cell types, none seem directly related to recombination causing rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
