First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft.

That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens.

So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C says mutation prevents recognition. That would be bad because the cell wouldn't help fight the infection, leading to rejection. So C is unlikely. - Option D mentions repairing T-cells, but repair usually brings back normal function, not helping with rejection. So D is probably wrong. - E is about all cells recognizing antigens, which doesn't fit because only specific cells (like T-cells) should do that. - F reduces the immune response, which would decrease rejection, so F is opposite of what we're looking for. - G increases tolerance, which helps accept the graft, so G is good but not directly causing rejection. - H suggests T-cells can't differentiate. That's true, but does it cause rejection? Maybe indirectly, but not the direct mechanism. - I leads to T-cells being less reactive. Again, affects their ability to handle foreign antigens, which contributes to rejection. - J deletes T-cells that can recognize foreign stuff. Deleting those would definitely cause rejection because they can't help with the foreign material. So J seems correct. - K-F related to recombination and mutation\u2014probably not in this context. - L-Affects variable responses, which ties into why recombination matters. So overall, B and J seem relevant. But let me check again. The main point is that mutation and recombination help T-cells recognize foreign antigens, which leads to their rejection. So among the options, B and J both relate to T-cell maturation and mutation. Wait, the question asks how these contribute. Both B and J are part of the same mechanism. However, the question is asking which one is correct. Since the question is multiple-choice with only one answer, I need to pick the best fit. Option B explains that mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to rejection. Option J states that mutation and recombination lead to the deletion of T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens. Both are valid points, but B is more about the effect on the T-cells themselves, whereas J is about deleting them, which is a consequence. So perhaps B is the better answer because it describes the mechanism leading to recognition and thus rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

That's not true because each cell type has specific antigens. - Options F and G talk about reducing and increasing immune responses. Both seem off because mutation increases susceptibility, not decreases resistance. - Options H and I mention identical receptors and deletions. Identical receptors could reduce variability, which might help, but they don't explain rejection. Deletions prevent recognizing foreign antigens, which fits with B. - Option J says mutations lead to T-cells deleting foreign ones. That makes sense because without proper recognition, the T-cells won't attack the foreign material. So putting it together, the best answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C claims mutation prevents recognition. That would mean the T-cells aren't rejecting the graft, but I think mutations actually enhance recognition, so C is probably wrong. - Option D mentions repair of damaged T-cells. I'm not sure how damage affects recognition; maybe it leads to better function, but not necessarily increased tolerance. So D doesn't seem right. - Option E suggests all cells recognize antigens, which doesn't sound right. Most cells have specific responses, and the immune system varies based on individual mutations. So E is unlikely. - Option F says mutations reduce the immune response. No, I think the opposite happens. Mutations usually boost the immune response because they introduce new antigens that the T-cells can recognize. So F is incorrect. - Option G talks about increasing the chance of accepting the graft. Wait, no, if the immune system is strong against foreign antigens, the body will accept the graft. So G is the opposite of what we want for rejection. - Option H says mutations generate T-cells that can't distinguish. That would reduce specificity, potentially causing more rejections because the cells might not target the foreign antigen properly. So H is also incorrect. - Option I states mutations cause the deletion of T-cells that can respond. If these T-cells are deleted, they won't fight foreign antigens as well, which could lead to more rejections. So I is incorrect too. - Option J says mutations lead to the deletion of T-cells that can handle foreign stuff. That fits with what I just thought\u2014mutations remove functional T-cells, leaving others weaker. So J seems correct. - Finally, option K isn't listed, so I guess none of the letters apply here, but since I need to choose one, let me see. The main point is that mutations and recombination allow T-cells to recognize foreign antigens, which then leads to rejection. So the best answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination.

So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C suggests mutation prevents recognition, but if T-cells are recognized, they wouldn't be rejected. So C would actually support rejection rather than hindering it. - Option D says mutations repair T-cells, which doesn't make much sense because repair usually depends on existing DNA.

I'm not sure how that directly contributes to rejection. It might make T-cells stronger, but why does that lead to rejection? Maybe if they're too strong, they can't fight back as well. Not sure about this one. - Option E says mutation leads all cells to recognize their own antigens. That doesn't make much sense. Antigens usually come from foreign materials, not your own. So E is probably wrong. - Option F says mutations reduce the immune response. While that could help, it's not about how it causes rejection specifically. So F might be a related point but not the direct answer. - Option G talks about increasing tolerance. If mutations enhance the immune system's ability to recognize foreign antigens, then yes, that would help in rejecting the graft. So G is another possible correct choice. - Option H says mutations generate T-cells that can't distinguish self and non-self. That sounds exactly like what happens during recombination. If a T-cell mutates, its receptor proteins change, allowing it to bind both self and foreign antigens. So H is accurate. - Option I states that mutations lead to deletions of T-cells that can recognize foreign antigens. Deletions could disrupt binding, so I think this relates to H. - Option J says mutations lead to the deletion of T-cells that can respond. Again, this ties into H. - Option K (if any) talks about generating identical receptors. That's similar to H, so K might be correct. - Option L (if any) says mutations create identical cells. Again, this aligns with H. - Option M (if any) says mutations increase the chance of acceptance. No, that's opposite; higher tolerance means less rejection. - Option N (if any) says mutations repair damage. I don't think that's directly related to T-cell function. - Option O (if any) says mutations in all cells. Unlikely since T-cells are specific. \n\nPutting it together, the most accurate statements seem to be B, H, K, and L. Since the user asked for a single letter, I'll pick the option that best captures the mechanism. B is about T-cell maturation resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That directly explains how T-cells contribute to rejection.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C suggests mutation prevents recognition. That would mean the cells aren't good at rejecting the graft, but if they're bad at accepting foreign stuff, wouldn't they be more likely to accept foreign antigens? Hmm, maybe not directly related to recombination causing rejection. - Option D mentions repair of damaged T-cells. Not sure how that ties into recombination causing rejection. - Option E talks about all cells recognizing antigens. That doesn't sound right; usually, the body has a mix of cells, and only one cell type (like T-cells) targets specific antigens. - Option F says mutations reduce the immune response. While mutations can sometimes lower the immune response, the primary mechanism here is T-cells recognizing foreign antigens, not necessarily reducing the overall immune response. The effectiveness comes from T-cells, not just the number. - Option G says mutations increase tolerance. That makes sense because T-cells have antibodies against foreign antigens. So mutations that enhance this ability would support rejection. - Option H claims mutations generate T-cells without differentiation. No, T-cells need to differentiate to target antigens, so H is incorrect. - Option I says mutations lead to deletions of T-cells that can respond. Deletions could reduce their function, potentially making them worse at responding, but that's more about specificity rather than discrimination. - Option J states mutations cause T-cells to delete those that can handle foreign antigens.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination.

Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens.

So both B and C seem possible. But let me think again. If mutations enhance the ability of T-cells to recognize antigens (like B), then option B is talking about this happening during T-cell maturation, which makes sense. Alternatively, if mutations prevent recognition, that also leads to rejection, as per C. So why choose between B and C? The question asks how mutation and recombination contribute. Both possibilities exist, but I need to see what each option states. Option B mentions T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That aligns with the idea that mutations enhance the cells' ability during maturation, making them recognize foreign stuff. On the other hand, option C says mutations prevent recognition, which is another valid angle. However, the way the question is phrased, it's about how mutation and recombination contribute\u2014both enhance and prevent recognition are contributions. But looking back at the options, I have to pick one. Maybe the key point is that during T-cell maturation, mutations enhance recognition, thus aiding rejection. Or perhaps the opposite. Wait, the question is asking how they contribute. Both mechanisms could contribute, but the options present them as separate answers. Since the question is multiple-choice, I need to select the best fit. Option B seems to directly link mutation during T-cell maturation to cells recognizing foreign antigens, which is a positive outcome for rejection.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C says mutations prevent recognition. That would mean the T-cells wouldn't be able to handle foreign antigens, definitely leading to rejection. So both B and C seem possible. But let me think again. If mutations enhance the ability of T-cells to recognize antigens (like B), then option B is talking about this happening during T-cell maturation, which makes sense. Alternatively, if mutations prevent recognition, that also leads to rejection, as per C. So why choose between B and C? The question asks how mutation and recombination contribute. Both possibilities exist, but I need to see what each option states. Option B mentions T-cell maturation in the thymus resulting in cells that recognize foreign antigens. That aligns with the idea that mutations enhance the cells' ability during maturation, making them recognize foreign stuff. On the other hand, option C says mutations prevent recognition, which is another valid angle. However, the way the question is phrased, it's about how mutation and recombination contribute\u2014both enhance and prevent recognition are contributions. But looking back at the options, I have to pick one. Maybe the key point is that during T-cell maturation, mutations enhance recognition, thus aiding rejection. Or perhaps the opposite. Wait, the question is asking how they contribute. Both mechanisms could contribute, but the options present them as separate answers. Since the question is multiple-choice, I need to select the best fit. Option B seems to directly link mutation during T-cell maturation to cells recognizing foreign antigens, which is a positive outcome for rejection. Option C is the opposite, but still contributes to rejection. Without more context, either could be correct. However, considering that recombination might involve combining different parts of the genome, which could lead to increased recognition (enhancing) rather than preventing. So maybe B is the intended answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C says mutation prevents recognition. That would mean the T-cells wouldn't react, but I thought mutations usually enhance rather than prevent. So maybe C is incorrect. - Options D and E seem unrelated; they're talking about repair and identical T-cells, which don't directly tie into rejection. - Option F mentions reducing the immune response. While mutations can sometimes lower the immune system, they might also cause higher tolerance, not lower. So F might be misleading. - Option G suggests increasing tolerance, which aligns with what I was thinking earlier\u2014mutations can boost the immune system's ability to handle foreign antigens, aiding in rejection. - Option H says generating identical receptors reduces variability. That's true, but it's too specific and not directly explaining why T-cells might reject the graft. - Option J points out that T-cells can't recognize foreign antigens, which would definitely lead to rejection. But that's too broad and doesn't explain the mechanism related to mutation and recombination. - Finally, option I says identical receptors reduce the immune response. Again, too specific and doesn't address the primary mechanism of mutation and recombination. \n\nPutting it together, the most accurate answer should be B, where mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in T-cells that recognize foreign antigens, causing rejection. It explains how mutations enhance T-cell function against foreign materials.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C says mutations prevent recognition. That would mean no foreign antigens are recognized, leading to full rejection. That also fits because without recognition, the T-cells won't attack the foreign material, causing severe rejection. So both B and C seem possible. Wait, but the question asks how they contribute. Both could be mechanisms, but the way the options are phrased, B explains how mutations cause T-cells to recognize foreign antigens, aiding in rejection.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C suggests mutation prevents recognition. That would mean no affinity, but if T-cells recognize foreign antigens, they'd be part of the machinery rejecting the graft. So C doesn't fit well. - Option D says mutations repair damaged T-cells. Wait, repair usually refers to fixing damage, not necessarily creating issues. Also, I don't recall mutations directly causing repair mechanisms, so D might not be accurate. - Option E implies everyone has the same antigens. No, that's not true; each cell has unique antibodies, so E is incorrect. - Option F says mutations reduce the immune response. While mutations can improve responses, they aren't the main cause of rejection. It's more about the cells' ability to recognize foreign antigens. So F isn't the best choice. - Option G suggests mutations increase tolerance. That's part of the story, but it's a secondary effect.

So D is unlikely. - Option E claims mutations cause everyone to have same antigens. No, mutations change specific genes, so each cell has its own. E is incorrect. - Option F says mutations reduce immune response. That's opposite of what happens. It actually increases the response because more effective antigens are recognized. So F is wrong. - Option G mentions increasing tolerance. Yes, if mutations allow better recognition, the immune system becomes more sensitive to foreign threats, aiding in rejection. G sounds correct. - Option H says mutations generate T-cells without differentiation. That's important because if a T-cell doesn't recognize itself, it won't help target foreign materials. So H is correct but perhaps not the strongest option. - Option I states mutations lead to T-cell deletions. Deletions could reduce their ability to recognize antigens. So I's effect is harmful, meaning it contributes negatively rather than positively. Therefore, I's not the right answer. - Option J says mutations delete T-cells that recognize foreign antigens. That makes sense because these cells aren't functional anymore, blocking the foreign material from being targeted. J is another good option. - Option K (not listed) talks about identical receptors.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down. First, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C suggests mutation prevents recognition. That would be bad for graft rejection, so probably not the answer. - Option D says mutations repair damaged T-cells. Wait, repairing damage usually means fixing issues, but mutations introduce errors. So repair wouldn't prevent recognition; it might make things worse. So D is unlikely. - Option E claims mutations cause everyone to have same antigens. No, mutations change specific genes, so each cell has its own. E is incorrect. - Option F says mutations reduce immune response. That's opposite of what happens. It actually increases the response because more effective antigens are recognized. So F is wrong. - Option G mentions increasing tolerance. Yes, if mutations allow better recognition, the immune system becomes more sensitive to foreign threats, aiding in rejection. G sounds correct. - Option H says mutations generate T-cells without differentiation. That's important because if a T-cell doesn't recognize itself, it won't help target foreign materials. So H is correct but perhaps not the strongest option. - Option I states mutations lead to T-cell deletions. Deletions could reduce their ability to recognize antigens. So I's effect is harmful, meaning it contributes negatively rather than positively. Therefore, I's not the right answer. - Option J says mutations delete T-cells that recognize foreign antigens. That makes sense because these cells aren't functional anymore, blocking the foreign material from being targeted. J is another good option. - Option K (not listed) talks about identical receptors. That reduces variability, but it's a negative outcome. Not directly related to rejection. - Option L (not listed) about variable responses\u2014same as above. - Option M (not listed) about tolerance. No, it's about reactivity. - Option N (not listed) about deleting cells that can handle foreign antigens. Yep, that's exactly what J is saying. - Option O (not listed) about generating identical receptors again. Same issue as K. - Option P (not listed) about creating identical receptors? Again, same problem. - Option Q (not listed) about reducing variability. Also bad. - Option R (not listed) about reducing immune response. Nope. - Option S (not listed) about random selection. Doesn't fit. - Option T (not listed) about all cells having same antigens. Definitely wrong. - Option U (not listed) about causing all to detect foreign antigens. Wrong logic. - Option V (not listed) about generating more tolerance. No, it's the opposite. So the best answers seem to be B, G, J, and M. But since we need only one letter, let's see. The question asks for the main contributor. Option B is about T-cell maturation and recognizing antigens, which directly affects reactivation after rejection. Option G also supports that idea by explaining increased tolerance. Both B and G are strong. However, the user wants only one letter, so I'll pick the most direct answer. Between B and G, both are correct, but G explains the mechanism behind it, while B is the event. Since the question is about contribution, G provides the reasoning.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection. Now, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens. Looking at the options: - Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right. - Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct. - Option C says mutations prevent recognizing antigens, which would definitely cause rejection. That fits too. - Option D mentions repairing T-cells, but repair usually helps prevent issues, not cause problems like rejection. So D is probably wrong. - Options E, F, G, H, I, J seem to be about different mechanisms. E says all cells recognize their own antigens\u2014this relates to B-cells, not T-cells as much. F and G talk about immune responses; increasing tolerance is good for rejection. H and J relate to T-cell function. Since the question is about T-cells (because it's about T-cell mediated grafts), I should focus on B and C. Between B and C, both suggest that mutations help T-cells recognize foreign antigens, causing rejection. So why choose one? The question asks specifically about mutation and recombination contributing to tissue graft rejection. Both B and C involve mutations helping cells recognize foreign antigens. However, the way the answer is structured, each option is a separate statement, and I have to pick the best fit. Since both B and C are valid points, but looking back, the main point here is that T-cells' ability to recognize foreign antigens contributes to rejection. So the most accurate answer would be either B or C. Wait, the question uses \"contribute,\" suggesting multiple factors. The initial thought was that recombination increases recognition. But actually, I need to see which option aligns best with the given choices. Maybe the intended answer is B, focusing on T-cell maturation and mutations leading to cell recognition.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

So F is probably incorrect. - Option G states mutations increase the chance of acceptance. No, if the immune system doesn't work well against foreign antigens, the body is less likely to accept the graft, so this wouldn't help. So G is incorrect. - Option H claims mutations generate T-cells that can't tell self from non-self. That makes sense because recombination and mutations often lead to differences in T-cell receptors. So H seems accurate. - Option I says mutations cause T-cells to delete foreign ones. That doesn't seem right because mutations typically enhance function rather than abolish recognition entirely. Deletion might be possible, but it's not the primary effect. So I might be off track here. - Option J suggests mutations lead to T-cell deletions.
