Mutation and recombination only occur in B-cells, not affecting T-cell mediated graft rejection.\n\nB. Mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to tissue graft rejection.\n\nC. Mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing foreign antigens.\n\nD. Mutation and recombination are involved in repairing damaged T-cells, which does not influence graft rejection.\n\nE. Mutation and recombination result in all cells recognizing their own antigens.\n\nF. Mutation and recombination reduce the immune response to foreign antigens.\n\nG. Mutation and recombination increase the chance of graft acceptance by enhancing immune tolerance.\n\nH. Mutation and recombination generate T-cells that cannot differentiate between self and non-self antigens.\n\nI. Mutation and recombination create identical T-cell receptors, reducing variability in immune response.\n\nJ. Mutation and recombination lead to the deletion of T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how mutation and recombination contribute to tissue graft rejection. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, I know that when a patient gets a new organ like a heart or liver, their body tries to grow a graft. If the donor's immune system doesn't recognize the foreign material, the body might reject the graft. That makes sense because if the immune system can't attack it, the body goes for other options, leading to rejection.\n\nNow, the question is about mutation and recombination. I remember that recombination involves mixing genetic material from different sources. So if there's mutation, maybe it changes some parts of the DNA, making the cells more likely to recognize foreign antigens.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- Option A says mutation and recombination don't affect B-cells. But wait, I think B-cells do play a role in fighting infections, including foreign ones. So probably A isn't right.\n  \n- Option B talks about T-cell maturation. T-cells mature in the thymus, and mutations could make them better at recognizing antigens. When they recognize foreign ones, they get rejected. This seems relevant because T-cells help target the foreign material effectively, so B sounds correct.\n  \n- Options C, D, E, F, G, H, J, etc., deal with things like T-cell recognition, repair, and immune responses. They mention processes like repair (D), creating identical receptors (I), deleting T-cells (J). These points support the idea that mutation affects T-cell function, leading to rejection.\n\nSo putting it together, the key point is that mutations during T-cell maturation allow these cells to recognize foreign antigens, which then leads to rejection of the graft. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",
