  "problem": "How can mutation and recombination contribute to the process of tissue graft rejection?\n\nA. Mutation and recombination only occur in B-cells, not affecting T-cell mediated graft rejection.\n\nB. Mutation and recombination during T-cell maturation in the thymus result in cells that recognize foreign antigens, contributing to tissue graft rejection.\n\nC. Mutation and recombination prevent T-cells from recognizing foreign antigens.\n\nD. Mutation and recombination are involved in repairing damaged T-cells, which does not influence graft rejection.\n\nE. Mutation and recombination result in all cells recognizing their own antigens.\n\nF. Mutation and recombination reduce the immune response to foreign antigens.\n\nG. Mutation and recombination increase the chance of graft acceptance by enhancing immune tolerance.\n\nH. Mutation and recombination generate T-cells that cannot differentiate between self and non-self antigens.\n\nI. Mutation and recombination create identical T-cell receptors, reducing variability in immune response.\n\nJ. Mutation and recombination lead to the deletion of T-cells that can respond to foreign antigens.",
