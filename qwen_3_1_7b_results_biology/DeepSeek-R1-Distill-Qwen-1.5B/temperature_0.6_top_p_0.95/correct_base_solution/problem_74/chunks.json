Problem: What are some advantages of doing genetics in bacteria and yeastinstead of in larger organisms (i.e.,multicellular eukaryotes)?\n\nA. Bacteria and yeast are more complex organisms.\n\nB. Bacteria and yeast have longer life cycles, allowing for extended study over time.\n\nC. Bacteria and yeast can perform more complex behaviors than multicellular organisms, which makes them better for study.\n\nD. Bacteria and yeast have larger genomes, providing more genetic material to work with.\n\nE. Bacteria and yeast are less susceptible to genetic diseases, making them more stable for experimentation.\n\nF. Bacteria and yeast have a slower rate of mutation.\n\nG. Bacteria and yeast do not require ethical considerations when used in experiments.\n\nH. Bacteria and yeast grow quickly, inexpensively, in a small space and have a high probability of mutation. Prokaryotes are haploid, making single inactivation more likely. Yeast are eukaryotic, closely related to multicellular animals and plants, and can be grown in either the haploid or diploid state.\n\nI. Bacteria and yeast have a lower rate of genetic recombination, making genetic mapping simpler.\n\nJ. Bacteria and yeast are easier to maintain in a lab.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the answer to this question about why we use bacteria and yeast instead of larger organisms like multicellular eukaryotes. The question is asking for some advantages they have over those bigger organisms. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, what's a multivariable organism? They're pretty big, have many cells, and they're complex because they're eukaryotes. So, thinking about their characteristics compared to bacteria and yeast. Bacteria are prokaryotes, meaning they live as single-celled organisms, while yeast are eukaryotes but similar to multicellular animals and plants.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Bacteria and yeast are more complex. Well, that might be true because they're simpler organisms, but I'm not sure if that's an advantage over larger ones. Maybe they're easier to study?\n\nB. Longer life cycle. Hmm, bacteria have shorter lifespans because they divide often, so maybe not. Yeast also have short lifecycles since they rely on nutrients. So probably not this one.\n\nC. More complex behaviors. That seems possible, but I don't know how much that translates into studying compared to larger organisms. Maybe smaller organisms can show more behavior changes?\n\nD. Larger genomes. No, wait, bacteria have smaller genomes because they're prokaryotes. Multicellular eukaryotes would have even larger genomes. So no, this isn't right.\n\nE. Less susceptibility to genetic diseases. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they are smaller, maybe they have fewer mutations? But I'm not sure about that. Also, I thought smaller organisms have higher mutation rates because they're more vulnerable to environmental changes. Maybe this is incorrect.\n\nF. Slower rate of mutation. Hmm, that could make sense because mutations are more common in smaller organisms where there's less redundancy in genes. So this might be correct.\n\nG. Do not require ethical considerations. Probably not; ethical issues are more relevant in larger organisms.\n\nH. Growth is quick and expensive in small spaces. Bacteria can replicate very quickly, so yes, they grow efficiently. Yeast too, especially in culture conditions. But the option says \"prokaryotes are haploid, making single inactivation more likely.\" Yeast being eukaryotic means they have nuclear DNA, so maybe this point about mutation is important here. This might be correct.\n\nI. Lower rate of genetic recombination. Genetic recombination is more efficient in eukaryotes because they can produce more diverse gametes. Bacteria have a single chromosome, so recombination is limited. This sounds correct.\n\nJ. Easier to maintain in a lab. Bacteria can be cultured in standard dishes without needing specialized equipment, whereas yeast might require specific setups or media. So this seems correct.\n\nNow, going back to the original question. It asks for advantages over larger organisms. So among these options, F, I, J seem plausible. However, I should consider each point.\n\nOption H mentions that prokaryotes (bacteria) are haploid, so each cell has only one set of chromosomes. This increases the likelihood of mutation because there's less redundancy. So this is a good reason for using bacteria and yeast.\n\nOption I states that genetic recombination is lower in eukaryotes, which makes mapping easier because recombinations create unique combinations, reducing complexity.\n\nOption J refers to the ease of maintenance, which is definitely a plus.\n\nSo combining these thoughts, the best answers are H, I, and J. Since the user wants a single letter, perhaps the most significant points are H, I, and J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",
