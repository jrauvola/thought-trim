The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J. Repolarization: Correct. Because it's decreasing from a hyperpolarized state. K. Synapse potential: Again, not sure, might not be relevant. L. Another terms: I think J is correct.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D.

Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F.

Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F.

Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F.

Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F.

Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons.

So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV.

Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event.

Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J.

Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J.

It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J. Repolarization: Correct. Because it's decreasing from a hyperpolarized state. K. Synapse potential: Again, not sure, might not be relevant. L. Another terms: I think J is correct.

Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J.

It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J. Repolarization: Correct. Because it's decreasing from a hyperpolarized state. K. Synapse potential: Again, not sure, might not be relevant. L. Another terms: I think J is correct.

Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term.

Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H.

The term \"repolarization\" makes sense because it's a decrease in membrane potential from a hyperpolarized state to rest. Alternatively, \"hyperpolarization\" is also correct because the potential is becoming more negative. Between B and J, both seem possible. Wait, the question is asking about the overall change. Repolarization implies a decrease, while hyperpolarization is the result. But the question is phrased as the change being considered, so perhaps it's about the nature of the change rather than the final state.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J. Repolarization: Correct. Because it's decreasing from a hyperpolarized state. K. Synapse potential: Again, not sure, might not be relevant. L. Another terms: I think J is correct. So, the answer should be J. However, wait\u2014let me double-check. The question asks what the change represents. Starting at +50mV and ending at -70mV. The term \"repolarization\" makes sense because it's a decrease in membrane potential from a hyperpolarized state to rest. Alternatively, \"hyperpolarization\" is also correct because the potential is becoming more negative. Between B and J, both seem possible. Wait, the question is asking about the overall change. Repolarization implies a decrease, while hyperpolarization is the result. But the question is phrased as the change being considered, so perhaps it's about the nature of the change rather than the final state. For example, from +50 to -70, the membrane potential is becoming more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. So, B. Hyperpolarization is the better answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question here about neuron membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are all different terms related to electrical properties of neurons. I need to pick the correct one. First, let's break down what each option means: - **Threshold potential**: This is the minimum potential needed for a neuron to fire or generate an action potential. It's like the starting point; if you don't reach it, you can't fire. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than rest. So, going from +10mV to -40mV would be hyperpolarization. - **Action potential**: This is the electrical signal that travels along a neuron's axon. It's generated when the membrane potential goes from depolarized (positive) to hyperpolarized (negative). - **Equilibrium potential**: This refers to the resting potential of a neuron, which is usually around -60mV. Once the neuron is at rest, its membrane potential doesn't change unless something else happens. - **Resting potential**: Similar to equilibrium potential but specifically referring to the state when the neuron isn't actively firing. - **Graded potential**: Not sure what this means, maybe varying levels of voltage? - **Depolarization**: When the membrane potential increases (becomes less positive), moving towards zero. - **Synapse potential**: Hmm, not too familiar with this term. Maybe related to connections between neurons? - **Refractory period**: The time a neuron cannot respond to a stimulus after receiving a signal. - **Repolarization**: When the membrane potential decreases from a hyperpolarized state back to resting, maybe through another depolarizing event. Now, looking at the given values: starts at +50mV and ends at -70mV. So, the membrane potential has gone from positive to much more negative. Let's go through each option: A. Threshold potential: To trigger an action potential, the membrane needs to reach or exceed the threshold. But the question describes a decrease, not reaching that point. So probably not A. B. Hyperpolarization: Yes, because the membrane potential is becoming more negative. So B seems likely. C. Action potential: This involves a transition from depolarized to hyperpolarized. Since we're moving from +50 to -70, there's definitely a change, but it's not just a single action potential generation. So C might not be right. D. Equilibrium potential: No, because once the neuron is resting, it's at -60mV, not -70mV. E. Resting potential: Similarly, no, because the question describes a change, not the resting state itself. F. Graded potential: I'm not certain, but it's not a standard term I know. G. Depolarization: Incorrect because the potential went from positive to negative. H. Synapse potential: Not familiar with this term, might not apply. I. Refractory period: This is about not responding after a stimulus, not directly related to the change described. J.
