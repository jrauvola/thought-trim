    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization. Alternatively, it's also a decrease, which is repolarization. So both B and J describe aspects of the same event. However, the question is framed as \"is considered\" and gives multiple options. The correct description should be hyperpolarization because it's moving away from resting, whereas repolarization is part of the process but doesn't fully capture the change described.\n\nWait, but the options are individual, so the best answer is either B or J. But considering the wording, the question is about the change itself, not the overall effect. The change is a transition from +50 to -70, which is a significant shift. Therefore, the most accurate term is hyperpolarization, which encompasses the shift from a resting potential to a very negative value.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization. Alternatively, repolarization would involve returning to the resting state. So, depending on whether the question considers the entire change or just the outcome, but typically, when someone changes from a higher to a lower potential, they become hyperpolarized, not repolarized. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.

However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory.

But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F.

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization. Therefore, the correct answer should be B.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization. Alternatively, J is repolarization, which is the reverse process. Both could be correct depending on context. However, the question is phrased as \"is considered\" which implies a description of the change itself rather than the reversal. So, the change is hyperpolarization, making option B the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is B",

Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting. In our case, the membrane potential went from +50 to -70, which is a significant drop, so it's definitely hyperpolarization.",

It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain.

But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon.

Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential.

It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting.

It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting. Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents.

Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change.

Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting.

The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential.

Here, the potential went from +50 to -70, so it became much more negative\u2014yes, hyperpolarization makes sense. - **C. action potential**: An action potential involves depolarization, causing a wave of increased positive charge along the axon. But the question shows a decrease, so it's not an action potential. - **D. equilibrium potential**: This happens when there's no net movement of ions, meaning the potential remains constant. Since the membrane potential changed, it's not equilibrium. - **E. resting potential**: The resting potential is around -60 mV. Our final membrane potential is -70, which is lower (more depolarized), so it's not resting potential. - **F. graded potential**: Graded could imply different states, but without specific details, it's unclear. However, since the membrane potential changed significantly, it's likely not just graded. - **G. depolarization**: This is an increase in positive charge. From +50 to -70, it's actually becoming more negative, so it's not depolarization. - **H. synapse potential**: Synapses are parts where signals are transmitted between neurons. I don't think this applies here. - **I. refractory period**: This relates to when a neuron can't fire again because of previous action potentials. Doesn't fit. - **J. repolarization**: This is a decrease in membrane potential returning towards resting. Yes, the membrane potential decreased, so it's repolarization. - **K. rest**: No, we're talking about a change, not at rest. - **L. synapse potential**: Same as above. So, the options are B, J, F. Now, looking at the answer choices, the user expects only a single letter. Among these, B, J, F all seem correct based on my analysis. But wait, the question asks what the change represents. It started at +50 and ended at -70. So, the membrane potential became more negative, indicating hyperpolarization. Wait, but the question isn't asking what happened, it's giving four possible descriptions and wants us to pick which describes the change. The options include both B (hyperpolarization) and J (repolarization). Repolarization is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state, while hyperpolarization is when it becomes more negative than resting.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about neurons and their membrane potentials. Let me try to figure it out step by step. The question says that the membrane potential changes from +50 millivolts to -70 millivolts. The options are various types of potentials or terms related to them. I remember learning some basic concepts about ion channels and how they affect voltage inside cells. First, let's break down what each term means: - **Membrane potential**: This is the difference in electric potential across the cell membrane between the inside and outside. It can be positive (membrane potential) or negative (reversed). - **Threshold potential**: I think this refers to the minimum membrane potential needed for an ion channel to open. If the membrane potential drops below this, ions start flowing into the cell. - **Hyperpolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting potential. So, if the resting potential is around -60 mV, hyperpolarization would mean going further into the negative range. - **Action potential**: This is a wave of depolarization (increase in positive charge) along the axon of a neuron. It causes muscle contraction and nerve impulse transmission. - **Equilibrium potential**: This occurs when the net flow of ions into and out of the cell balances, resulting in no net change in membrane potential. It's like when the concentration gradient equals the transport impedance. - **Resting potential**: This is the natural potential of the neuron's membrane under resting conditions, usually around -60 mV. - **Depolarization**: This is when the membrane potential becomes more positive than the resting potential. It's the opposite of hyperpolarization. - **Repolarization**: This is when the membrane potential decreases back towards its resting state after an action potential has caused a depolarization. - **Synapse potential**: Not sure about this one; perhaps it's not relevant here. - **Refractory period**: This is the time within which a neuron cannot fire due to electrical activity in its cell body. - **Graded potential**: This might refer to different levels of membrane potential, but I'm not certain. Now, applying this to the given problem: Membrane potential goes from +50 mV to -70 mV. So, initially, it was at a relatively low positive level, then dropped significantly into the negative territory. Looking at the options: - **A. threshold potential**: The threshold potential is the minimum to cause ion flow. But we're seeing a decrease, not necessarily reaching a threshold yet. - **B. hyperpolarization**: Hyperpolarization means becoming more negative than resting.
