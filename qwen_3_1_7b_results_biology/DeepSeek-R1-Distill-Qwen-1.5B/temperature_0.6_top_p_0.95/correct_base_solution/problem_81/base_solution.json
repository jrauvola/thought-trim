  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out this genetics question about Mr. Brown and Mrs. Brown having an autosomal recessive condition that makes them anemic. Both of them have a substitution in either their beta-chain (Mr.) or alpha-chain (Mrs.), which means they both have one copy of the defective allele instead of two. Since it's recessive, neither parent is showing the disease themselves because they don't have two copies of the mutated gene.\n\nNow, neither Betsy nor Boopsy, their children, are anemic. So if I think about blood types, where A is dominant and B is recessive, but in this case, it's a different system. Autosomal recessive would mean each parent contributes a B allele for the child to receive, making them Bb. But if the condition is autosomal recessive, then to express the disease, you need two copies of the defective allele, like BB or Bb? Wait, no\u2014wait, actually, in recessive conditions, only when you have two copies does the disease manifest. So if someone has one defective allele, they don't get sick.\n\nSo if both parents have Bb (since they have one substitution), then their children could have:\n\n- BB (if both give B)\n- Bb (if one gives B and the other gives b)\n\nIn terms of the autosomal recessive condition, only those who have two copies (BB) would be affected. Bb individuals would be carriers but wouldn't have the disease yet. However, in reality, many autosomal recessive diseases require at least one copy to be expressed, meaning they're always carriers unless there's another factor. So why aren't any of their children showing the disease?\n\nWait, but the question says neither Betsy nor Boopsy are anemic, which suggests they don't have the condition. So maybe the children don't display the condition because they're carriers, but carriers don't show the phenotype immediately\u2014they just carry it. So perhaps the answer relates to whether the children are carriers or not.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D says both parents have a homozygous trait but may or may not pass the disorder to their children. Homozygous here would mean both alleles are the same. If both parents are homozygous for the recessive allele, like BB or bb, then their children would all be Bb. But wait, if they were both bb (homozygous recessive), they'd already be affected, but the question says they don't have the condition. So maybe they're both Bb.\n\nWait, let me clarify. Autosomal recessive means both alleles must be recessive for the condition to manifest. So if a person is Bb, they don't have the disease. Their children would be:\n\n- BB (if both parents give B): healthy\n- Bb (each parent gives B and b): carriers, but not affected\n\nBut according to the scenario, neither Betsy nor Boopsy are anemic, implying they don't have the condition. So if they're both Bb, their children could be either BB (healthy) or Bb (carriers). But the question doesn't specify anything else, so perhaps the key point is that both parents are carriers (Bb), hence they might pass the disorder to their children (Bb), but none of the children are affected yet. Therefore, the correct explanation would be that both parents are carriers (option D).\n\nAlternatively, option E says the children cannot be carriers because they're not anemic. That doesn't make sense because carriers don't necessarily display the condition; they just carry it. So E is incorrect.\n\nOption F says there's a 50% chance of being carriers and 25% affected. That sounds more like Mendelian probabilities, assuming independent assortment and random segregation. But in reality, without knowing the mode of inheritance (like whether it's autosomal), we can't assume complete randomness. But since the question specifies autosomal recessive, it implies Mendelian inheritance, so F might be applicable if considering genotype probabilities, but the question isn't asking about probabilities but rather what explains why the children aren't affected.\n\nTherefore, the best answer seems to be D: Both parents have a homozygous trait but may or may not pass the disorder to their children. Wait, but if they were both homozygous recessive (bb), they'd be affected, but the scenario says they don't have it. So they must be heterozygous (Bb), hence option D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",
