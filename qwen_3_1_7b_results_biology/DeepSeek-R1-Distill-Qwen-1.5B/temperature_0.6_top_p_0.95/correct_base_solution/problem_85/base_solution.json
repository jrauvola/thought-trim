  "solution": "\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. \n\nFirst, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference?\n\nI recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right?\n\nNow, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much?\n\nOption B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect.\n\nOptions C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary.\n\nOption E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure.\n\nOption F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation.\n\nOption G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's.\n\nOption H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures.\n\nOption J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm.\n\nPutting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.\n\nLooking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. Option C adds external support, which is necessary if the cell wall isn't present.\n\nSo the most accurate answer would be either A or C. Since the question is about survival, the key point is that without the cell wall, bacteria can still survive because they rely on osmotic balance rather than chemical bonds. Therefore, the best choice is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",
