Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much?

So if you remove the cell wall, would that allow them to survive in a hypertonic environment? Or does it require the original environment to be hypertonic to begin with? I'm getting confused. Let me think again. When you digest a bacterial cell, the cell lumen becomes concentrated, which causes the cell walls to collapse. So even if the cell wall is removed, the bacteria can still survive in some environments. Maybe the key point is that without the cell wall, the bacteria are exposed to the cell lumen, which is more concentrated, similar to being in a hypertonic medium. So perhaps option E is correct in stating that they can survive without the cell wall in a hypertonic medium.\n\nThen, moving on to the second part: the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls. I know that plant cell walls are made of cellulose, and bacteria's are made of peptidoglycan.

So the answer should mention that bacteria's cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, and plant cell walls are made of cellulose.

Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. If the medium is too high in solute (hypertonic), the cell wall might be more likely to fail. But if it's too low, maybe the bacteria can live on its own. However, I thought that normally bacteria prefer hypertonic conditions because they need water to survive. Option F mentions glycoproteins, but again, bacteria's cell wall isn't glycoprotein. Option G says they can't survive, but I think it's wrong because they do survive. Option H says the cell wall is made of lipids, which doesn't sound right either since cell walls are made of proteins. Option I claims the cell wall regenerates quickly, but I'm not sure if that's true. Option J states they can't live without the cell wall because it provides nutrients. That doesn't seem right either because some bacteria actually use cell walls for defense against antibiotics, though sometimes they get killed by them. \n\nPutting it all together, I think the correct answer is A. The bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. This makes sense because removing the cell wall might help them find a less stressful environment, especially if the surrounding solution is just right for their survival needs.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic would mean outside osmotic pressure is higher, so the bacteria would be more susceptible. But I'm not certain if this applies here since we're removing the wall, not changing the surrounding environment. Option F mentions glycoproteins, which I don't think apply to bacteria. Option G says they can't survive without the wall, but I think they can. Option H is about lipid content, but bacteria don't store much in their cell walls. Option I says regeneration happens, but I don't think cell walls in bacteria can easily regenerate. Option J points out that plant cell walls have more components. So putting it all together, the most plausible answer seems to be A, suggesting survival in an isotonic medium despite the absence of the cell wall.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means outside is more concentrated, which would be bad because the bacteria need to maintain their osmotic pressure. So removing the cell wall wouldn't help them in that case. Option F mentions glycoproteins, which are part of plant cell walls, but bacteria don't have those. G says the bacteria can't survive without the cell wall. That seems correct based on my understanding. H claims the cell wall is composed of lipids. I think cell walls are mostly made of proteins, especially peptidoglycan. So H doesn't sound right. J says bacteria can't live without the cell wall because it's essential. That fits with what I know. K and L aren't among the options, so I'll skip them. Between A, D, E, F, G, H, J, the main contenders are A, D, E, J, and K (which isn't available). \n\nSo, considering all that, the best answer should be J because it directly states that the cell wall is necessary for survival.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. If the solution inside is more concentrated (hypertonic), the bacteria might grow because water moves into them. But if it's less concentrated (hypotonic), the bacteria might shrink. But removing the cell wall wouldn't change the fact that the solution is just losing some outer layers. Unless the cell wall affects osmotic flow somehow. Hmm, I'm not certain about this one either. Option F mentions glycoproteins versus plant cell walls. Glycoproteins are part of cell membranes, so maybe they're involved, but I don't think that's relevant here. Option G says the cell can't survive without the wall, implying it needs it. That contradicts what I thought earlier. Option H says the wall is made of lipids. I don't think bacterial cell walls are made of lipids. Option I claims the wall regenerates quickly and uses more lipids. That doesn't sound right either. Finally, option J states bacteria can't live without the wall because they provide nutrients. I remember something about lichens being able to survive without cell walls, so maybe bacteria also do that. But I'm not sure if that's accurate. Let me try to piece this together. Lysozyme should be able to cut off the cell wall, but maybe the bacteria have other ways to survive. Since their cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is hydrophobic, perhaps the cell wall isn't easily torn apart unless lysozyme does a good job. As for survival in different media, maybe without the wall, the bacteria can tolerate a lower concentration of ions inside. So perhaps they can live in hypotonic media without the wall. Looking back, option A seems plausible because it says they can survive in an isotonic medium, which could relate to the lack of osmotic stress once the wall is removed. Alternatively, option E says in hypertonic media, but I don't think removing the wall helps with that. So maybe the correct answer is A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Option I says the cell wall regenerates quickly. I remember reading that some bacteria can shed their cell walls quickly, so maybe they can survive without them temporarily. Option J points out that the main nutrient in bacteria is lignin, not plant cell walls.

    "rollout": " If the medium is more concentrated, water moves into the bacteria, making them bigger and perhaps more susceptible to damage. But if it's less concentrated, water leaves, shrinking the bacteria. I'm not certain how this relates directly to cell wall removal. Option F is about glycoproteins, which I don't think apply here since the main protein in bacterial cell walls is peptidoglycan. Option G says the bacteria can't survive without the wall. That seems opposite of what I was thinking earlier. Option H mentions lipids, but I don't recall anything about cell wall lipids. Option J says the cell walls are made of lignin in bacteria versus cellulose in plants. I believe plant cell walls do have lignin, but bacteria don't, so J could be correct. Option K isn't listed, so I'll skip it. \n\nPutting it all together, I think removing the cell wall with lysozyme might allow the bacteria to live because the environment doesn't necessarily need as high an osmotic pressure. Instead, the bacteria might just become smaller. Also, since bacteria are already small, maybe the cell wall isn't critical for survival once it's removed. However, some sources say that without the cell wall, bacteria might survive better because they don't need the outer protection. But others argue that without the cell wall, the bacteria might lose some defense mechanisms. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should focus on the first part of the question again: will the bacteria survive without the cell wall?\n\nSo, considering that the cell wall is removed, and assuming the bacteria are grown in a medium that allows them to grow (maybe with minimal nutrients), they might still survive. Therefore, the answer would be something related to option A, suggesting they can live without the wall in an isotonic medium. Alternatively, option J points out that plant cell walls have more lignin, but bacteria don't, so maybe J is relevant. Wait, but J is talking about the type of protein, not the composition. Since the cell wall is peptidoglycan, J might not be accurate. Let me go back to the options.\n\nLooking at option A: \"The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium...\" This seems plausible because if the solution is just the right concentration, water will enter, shrinking the bacteria and letting them survive. But I'm not 100% sure if this applies specifically to bacteria or not. Another thought: when I was taught before, I remember that sometimes when you try to dig a hole in a bacterium's shell, it can actually grow a little bit because the cell wall isn't completely destroyed. So maybe the cell can survive without the wall, especially if the surrounding medium is not too different. So option A could be the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

But if it's less concentrated, water leaves, shrinking the bacteria. I'm not certain how this relates directly to cell wall removal. Option F is about glycoproteins, which I don't think apply here since the main protein in bacterial cell walls is peptidoglycan. Option G says the bacteria can't survive without the wall. That seems opposite of what I was thinking earlier. Option H mentions lipids, but I don't recall anything about cell wall lipids. Option J says the cell walls are made of lignin in bacteria versus cellulose in plants. I believe plant cell walls do have lignin, but bacteria don't, so J could be correct. Option K isn't listed, so I'll skip it. \n\nPutting it all together, I think removing the cell wall with lysozyme might allow the bacteria to live because the environment doesn't necessarily need as high an osmotic pressure. Instead, the bacteria might just become smaller. Also, since bacteria are already small, maybe the cell wall isn't critical for survival once it's removed. However, some sources say that without the cell wall, bacteria might survive better because they don't need the outer protection. But others argue that without the cell wall, the bacteria might lose some defense mechanisms. I'm a bit confused now. Maybe I should focus on the first part of the question again: will the bacteria survive without the cell wall?\n\nSo, considering that the cell wall is removed, and assuming the bacteria are grown in a medium that allows them to grow (maybe with minimal nutrients), they might still survive. Therefore, the answer would be something related to option A, suggesting they can live without the wall in an isotonic medium. Alternatively, option J points out that plant cell walls have more lignin, but bacteria don't, so maybe J is relevant. Wait, but J is talking about the type of protein, not the composition. Since the cell wall is peptidoglycan, J might not be accurate. Let me go back to the options.\n\nLooking at option A: \"The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium...\" This seems plausible because if the solution is just the right concentration, water will enter, shrinking the bacteria and letting them survive. But I'm not 100% sure if this applies specifically to bacteria or not. Another thought: when I was taught before, I remember that sometimes when you try to dig a hole in a bacterium's shell, it can actually grow a little bit because the cell wall isn't completely destroyed. So maybe the cell can survive without the wall, especially if the surrounding medium is not too different. So option A could be the correct one.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

That seems unlikely unless the wall isn't functional. Option H mentions lipids. Bacteria's cell walls are mostly lipids, right? They don't have proteins except for some structures. Option I is interesting. It says the wall regenerates quickly, so the bacteria can survive without it temporarily. But does lysozyme cause regeneration? I think it might just create a hole, making it easier for the bacteria to find food. Also, I don't recall bacteria having such quick regeneration mechanisms. So maybe I should focus back on the main points. Since I think the cell wall is essential, maybe the answer is G or J. But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again. If the cell wall is removed, especially lysozyme, which can cut through it, do the bacteria still survive? I remember reading that sometimes bacteria can live despite being stripped of their shells. But the question also asks about the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant ones. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is a polysaccharide, while plant cell walls are made of cellulose, which is a carbohydrate. So maybe that's related to one of the options. Looking back at options, I think option B was wrong, option C is about structural support, which doesn't seem relevant. Option I is talking about regeneration, which I think isn't accurate either. So perhaps the correct answer is G, saying they can't survive without the cell wall. Or maybe J, which talks about the importance of the wall. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to summarize: Without the cell wall, the bacteria can still live in some cases, depending on the medium (hypertonic vs hypotonic). But the original question is whether they can \"live\" without the wall. Since the answer choices suggest specific letters, I need to pick the most appropriate one. I think option G says they can't survive without the wall, implying that the wall is crucial. Alternatively, if the wall is present but not functional, the bacteria wouldn't survive. But since lysozyme is used to remove it, maybe the wall is destroyed, leaving the bacteria vulnerable. However, I'm not entirely certain. Another thought: Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is a type of carbohydrate. Plant cell walls are made of cellulose, another carbohydrate. So maybe the difference lies in the type of carbohydrate, but I don't see an option addressing that directly. Going back to the options, I think the correct answer is G because it states they can't survive without the wall, but I'm not 100% confident. Alternatively, if the answer is I, it suggests regeneration happens, which I think isn't true. So I'll go with G.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means outside is more concentrated, which could be bad for bacteria. If the medium is more concentrated, water moves into the bacteria, potentially killing them. Hypotonic is the opposite\u2014water leaves, so the bacteria would multiply. So removing the cell wall might affect survival based on the surrounding medium. Option F is about glycoproteins versus cellulose. Again, bacteria don't have glycoproteins in their cell walls. Option G says they can't survive without the wall, implying the wall is essential. That seems unlikely unless the wall isn't functional. Option H mentions lipids. Bacteria's cell walls are mostly lipids, right? They don't have proteins except for some structures. Option I is interesting. It says the wall regenerates quickly, so the bacteria can survive without it temporarily. But does lysozyme cause regeneration? I think it might just create a hole, making it easier for the bacteria to find food. Also, I don't recall bacteria having such quick regeneration mechanisms. So maybe I should focus back on the main points. Since I think the cell wall is essential, maybe the answer is G or J. But I'm getting confused now. Let me try again. If the cell wall is removed, especially lysozyme, which can cut through it, do the bacteria still survive? I remember reading that sometimes bacteria can live despite being stripped of their shells. But the question also asks about the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant ones. Bacterial cell walls are made of peptidoglycan, which is a polysaccharide, while plant cell walls are made of cellulose, which is a carbohydrate. So maybe that's related to one of the options. Looking back at options, I think option B was wrong, option C is about structural support, which doesn't seem relevant. Option I is talking about regeneration, which I think isn't accurate either. So perhaps the correct answer is G, saying they can't survive without the cell wall. Or maybe J, which talks about the importance of the wall. Wait, I'm getting mixed up. Let me try to summarize: Without the cell wall, the bacteria can still live in some cases, depending on the medium (hypertonic vs hypotonic). But the original question is whether they can \"live\" without the wall. Since the answer choices suggest specific letters, I need to pick the most appropriate one.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. I thought that normally, the bacteria are in a hypotonic environment because the solution is less concentrated outside their cell.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means more solute outside, which would be bad for bacteria because water moves into them. So if the medium is hypotonic, water can move out, making it easier for the bacteria to survive. But does that apply here? Since we're removing the cell wall, maybe the surrounding environment is more favorable. Option F mentions glycoproteins instead of chitin. I'm not sure about that either. Option G says they can't survive without the wall, which seems unlikely. Option H says the wall is composed of lipids. That doesn't sound right because cell walls are mostly protein.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Lysozyme might be effective in hypertonic conditions because there's more solute outside, making it harder for the bacteria to survive. But does removing the cell wall affect the internal environment? Hmm. Option F mentions glycoproteins, but again, I think bacterial cell walls are different. G is saying they can't survive without the cell wall, which contradicts what I thought earlier. H says the cell wall is made of lipids. That doesn't sound right either. J says they need lignin, which I believe is found in some bacteria, but not all. L is about regeneration after being removed. This seems plausible since some bacteria might regrow their cell walls over time. But the main point is survival, not necessarily regeneration.\n\nPutting it all together, I think the key points are: cell walls are present but not crucial for survival once removed, especially in certain conditions (like isotonic). Also, bacteria can survive without them in hypertonic solutions due to the high osmolarity outside. Regeneration after removal might happen, but the immediate answer is about survival. Looking back at the options, option J says bacteria cannot live without their cell walls because they provide nutrients, which makes sense since the wall protects against entry into the host environment. So, the main issue is whether they can survive without the wall, which would be related to the surrounding solution's osmolarity.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. I think cell walls can be tricky depending on the surrounding environment, but I'm not certain how removing them affects survival. Option F mentions glycoproteins, but I don't think that's relevant here. G says they can't survive without the cell wall, which contradicts what I was thinking earlier. H says the cell wall has lipids, which isn't correct either. J points out that bacterial walls are made of lignin and plant walls have more components. So J seems plausible. I said earlier that removing the wall could allow the bacteria to survive, which would make J correct. So putting it all together, the best answer seems to be J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

I'm not certain about this one either. \n\nNow, moving on to the second part: the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls. Bacteria have peptidoglycan as their cell wall, whereas plants have cellulose and lignin. I remember reading that plant cell walls are stronger because they contain more components like lignin, which breaks down into smaller pieces. But wait, bacteria also have a lot of peptidoglycan, which isn't broken down. So how do they compare? I think plant cell walls are generally stronger due to the presence of more enzymes and more cross-linking peptides, but bacteria have a similar structure. Wait, actually, I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. Bacteria have a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, including chitin, unlike plant cell walls which are mostly cellulose. So maybe the answer relates to the presence of chitin versus cellulose. Looking back at the options, F says bacterial walls are made of glycoproteins and plant walls have chitin. That doesn't sound right because bacteria don't produce glycoproteins\u2014they have peptidoglycan. Wait, perhaps I'm mixing up some terms. Alternatively, G says bacteria can't survive without their walls because they provide nutrients. But I thought the main issue was about osmotic pressure and presence of water. \n\nLooking at H and J, they mention lipids and cell wall composition. H says bacterial walls are composed of lipids, which I don't think is correct. J mentions cell walls being made of lignin for bacteria, but I remember that plant cell walls have more types like lignin. So J seems off. \n\nSo, putting it all together, for the first part, I think option A might be correct because without the cell wall, bacteria might survive in an isotonic medium, especially if there's structural support. For the second part, I think it's about the presence of chitin in bacteria (since they lack glycoproteins) compared to plant cell walls which have chitin. Looking at the options, F says bacterial walls are glycoproteins and plant walls have chitin\u2014no, that's wrong. Option G says bacteria can't survive without their walls because they provide nutrients, which seems plausible. Option H is incorrect about lipids. Option J is wrong about lignin. \n\nWait, another angle: bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, which is a complex mixture of proteins, while plants' is mainly cellulose. So maybe the answer is related to the types of proteins present. Looking at the options, I don't see any directly stating that, but F and J relate to glycoproteins, which bacteria don't have. So perhaps none of those are correct. \n\nAlternatively, considering that plant cell walls are more robust due to more enzymes, but I'm not sure if that applies to bacteria. Since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, maybe the key point is that their cell walls are made of different proteins compared to plants. So perhaps the correct answer is F, but I'm not entirely sure. \n\nWait, going back, I think the answer is A for the first part because without the cell wall, bacteria can survive in an isotonic medium, especially with structural support. For the second part, since bacteria lack glycoproteins and instead have chitin, the correct statement would involve chitin, but I don't see such an option. Hmm, maybe I need to reevaluate my earlier thoughts. \n\nAnother approach: bacteria have cell walls made of peptidoglycan, while plants have cell walls made of cellulose. So the difference is in the type of protein.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Lysozyme removes the cell wall, making the environment more similar to the bacterial environment (hypertonic). In that case, the bacteria should be fine because there's less solute pulling them towards the rim. Option F mentions glycoproteins and chitin versus chitin and cellulose. Glycoproteins are different from chitin. I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Option G says they can't survive without the cell wall, implying that the wall is crucial.

But I'm supposed to choose the best option. \n\nWait, the user asked two questions: first, whether the bacteria can live without their cell wall after lysozyme treatment, and second, the biochemical difference between bacterial cell walls and plant cell walls. So based on my analysis, the first part (can live) is true because they can survive in certain conditions. For the second part, the cell walls differ in composition\u2014bacteria use peptidoglycan, while plants use cellulose and lignin. So the correct option should reflect that.\n\nLooking at the options, H states that bacterial walls have higher lipid content compared to plant cell walls. That makes sense because peptidoglycan is rich in lipids. So H seems correct. Alternatively, J says bacteria can't live without the wall because they need the nutrients. Both are correct, but I think H is more accurate because it directly addresses the composition difference.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Lysozyme should be able to dissolve the cell wall regardless of the surrounding medium since it's breaking down the cell wall itself. So maybe E isn't correct either. Option F mentions glycoproteins and plant cell walls being made of cellulose and lignin. That doesn't fit because bacteria don't have glycoproteins, and their walls are different. Option G says they can't survive without the wall, which seems contradictory because I thought removing the wall could allow them to live. Option H claims the cell wall is made of lipids. No, that's not true; bacteria's cell wall uses proteins. Option J says the wall provides nutrients, but I think the wall actually protects against threats like toxins, not necessarily providing nutrients. Option I says the wall can regenerate, meaning some bacteria might survive without the wall temporarily. But does this happen often? Maybe, but not all cases. So putting it all together, I think the best answer is A because without the cell wall, the bacteria can adapt by surviving in an isotonic environment, possibly due to reduced solute concentration. This allows them to function despite the absence of the protective shell.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. If the environment was more water, maybe the bacteria couldn't survive because osmotic pressure is high outside. But removing the cell wall should help them out regardless. Option F mentions glycoproteins, which I don't think apply here since bacteria don't produce those. Option G says they can't survive, which contradicts my earlier thought. Option H says the cell wall has lipids, but I believe bacterial cell walls are mostly proteins. Option I brings up regeneration time, which doesn't seem relevant here. Finally, option J states that without the cell wall, bacteria can't live because they need nutrients. That makes sense because cell walls provide those nutrients. So putting it all together, the answer should be J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means outside is more concentrated, so bacteria might lose water, which could be bad. But if the cell wall is removed, maybe the bacteria can just live because they don't need water anymore. Option F and G mention different substances, like lipids or glycoproteins. I'm not familiar enough with those terms to say for sure. Option H suggests the bacterial cell wall has higher lipids, but I thought plant cell walls were mostly carbohydrate-based, especially since they contain chitin, which is a type of carbohydrate. Option J mentions lignin, which bacteria do use. So maybe the cell wall isn't completely destroyed, allowing them to survive. Putting it all together, I think the answer is either A or J. But since the user said to pick one, I'll go with A because it's about survival in an isotonic medium, which aligns with the idea that removing the cell wall doesn't kill them unless something else happens.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means outside is more concentrated, so water moves into them, potentially killing the bacteria. But if the cell wall isn't there, does that help? Not sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins, which sounds unrelated. Option G says the cell wall can't survive without it. That doesn't sound right because I think without the wall, some bacteria can still survive if the cell is intact. Option H says the wall is made of lipids, which I don't think is correct. Option I brings up regeneration and differences in lipid content. I'm not familiar enough with all the details, so I might be mixing things up. Finally, option J says bacteria rely on cell walls for nutrients. Since they're surrounded by a shell, maybe the wall is crucial for their survival despite being removed. So putting it all together, I think removing the cell wall allows bacteria to survive because their environment is still suitable. So the answer should be either A or J.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. I thought bacteria prefer hypertonic environments because they're more water-hungry, but removing the cell wall might not change that much. Option F mentions glycoproteins, but bacteria don't have glycoproteins; they do have lipids. Option G says the bacterial cell can't survive without the wall, which contradicts my earlier thoughts. Option H says the cell wall is made of lipids, which aligns with what I just thought. Option I talks about regeneration, but I don't think cell walls need to regenerate quickly for survival\u2014maybe it's more temporary. Option J states that without the wall, the cell can't live because it provides nutrients, but I believe cell walls are necessary for function and protection. \n\nSo putting it all together, I think the main point is that bacteria can survive without the cell wall because lysozyme can cut it away, especially in an isotonic environment. This supports option A, where they can live without the cell wall in such conditions.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. I think bacteria prefer low osmolarity environments, so maybe they need some sort of environment that doesn't have too high an osmotic pressure. Option F mentions glycoproteins, but again, I'm not certain. Option G says they can't survive without the cell wall, but I think some do. Option H claims the cell wall uses lipids, but I think it's more likely proteins. Option I says the regenerative aspect, but I don't recall anything about bacterial cell walls being able to regenerate quickly. Option J suggests the cell wall provides essential nutrients, so without it, the bacteria can't live. That seems plausible because cell walls help in nutrient absorption and defense. Looking back, the main point is that removing the cell wall (with lysozyme) allows the bacteria to survive. So the correct answer should be related to whether they can live without it. Between A and J, I think J is better because it directly ties the absence of the cell wall to survival due to providing essential nutrients. Also, I remember something about enzymes like lipase having different roles depending on the medium, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is J",

I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Hypertonic means outside is more concentrated, which would cause water to move into the bacterial cell, potentially causing death. Hypotonic is the opposite. But removing the cell wall doesn't directly change the concentration\u2014it just removes the barrier. So E might be wrong. Option F mentions glycoproteins instead of chitin. I thought the cell wall was made of peptidoglycan, not glycoproteins. Option G says it can't survive without the cell wall. That seems unlikely since bacteria can often live without a complete cell wall. Option H says the cell wall is made of lipids. No, that's not right\u2014cell walls are mostly carbohydrate structures. Option I says the cell wall can regenerate quickly, meaning bacteria can survive without it. This also sounds plausible because some bacteria can shed their cell walls over time. But does that mean they can live without one in general? Not necessarily, but it's possible. So putting it all together, the most likely correct answer is A because it states that bacteria can live without their cell wall in an isotonic medium, relying on the absence of a solid barrier.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

But the question is about removing the cell wall, not changing the environment. So E doesn't seem relevant. Option F and G mention lipids and glycoproteins. I'm not sure about that either. Finally, options J and I discuss necessity and biochemical differences between bacterial and plant cell walls. I remember that bacterial cell walls have high lipid content, which protects them from digestion. Plant cell walls have both cellulose and lipids. So I think the correct answer should relate to the fact that bacteria need cell walls for protection, especially against antibiotics. When the cell wall is removed, the bacteria can't function properly, so they die. Looking back, option A seems to fit because without the cell wall, the bacteria can still survive in an isotonic medium since the cytoplasm isn't as concentrated. And the cell wall is made of insoluble peptidoglycan. Also, the key point is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content than plant cell walls. So putting it all together, the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect.

Option F mentions glycoproteins, which I don't think apply here since bacterial walls are different. G says they can't survive without the wall because they provide nutrients. That rings a bell because some bacteria require protection to stay alive, especially under stress.

Also, considering that bacteria often thrive in low concentrations, maybe the correct answer is A.

    "full_cot": "<|im_start|>user\nAnswer this question step by step with only a single letter. Problem: A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?\n\nA. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nB. The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.\n\nC. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.\n\nD. The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.\n\nE. The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nF. The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.\n\nG. The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.\n\nH. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.\n\nI. The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.\n\nJ. The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter.
