    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.

Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive.

Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. Even though lysozyme might cleave the wall, the bacteria can still function if they have another defense mechanism, like some form of protection or ability to adapt quickly. Therefore, the biochemical difference between bacterial and plant cell walls is that bacteria's are made up of peptidoglycan, which includes chitin, unlike plants' which are cellulose and lignin.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure.

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone?

The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter. Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. Even though the cell wall isn't there, the environment's osmotic balance allows them to survive. Option J also touches on the cell wall composition, but I think A is more accurate. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone?

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer.

I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive.

But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme.

Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer.

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much?

They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls.

I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much?

Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. Option J also touches on the type of protein in the cell wall, which aligns with what I know about bacteria. Between A and J, I think A is broader because it includes both the environment and the structural aspect.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure.

Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference?

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm.

The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. Therefore, the correct letter should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media. Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out whether a bacterial cell can survive if its cell wall is removed using lysozyme. From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media.

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect. Options C and D talk about structural support and presence of other proteins. I'm not sure about the specifics here; maybe these are too detailed or unnecessary. Option E talks about hypertonic vs hypotonic media.

Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm.

Bacteria prefer hypertonic environments (with more solutes), so maybe removing the cell wall could cause them to die because they're exposed to high concentrations. But I'm not entirely sure. Option F mentions glycoproteins. No, bacteria don't produce glycoproteins like plants do\u2014plasmodesmata is involved, not glycosylation. Option G says the bacterial wall has higher lipids. That doesn't sound right. Lipids are part of plant cell walls, not bacteria's. Option H says the cell wall is composed of lipids. Again, bacteria don't have lipids in their cell walls. They have lipids in plasmodesmata, but those are different structures. Option J compares the cell wall being made of lignin versus plant cell walls. I think plant cell walls have both cellulose and lignin, while bacteria's are mainly peptidoglycan, which includes chitin. So J seems plausible, but I need to confirm. Putting it all together, since bacteria don't have cell walls in the traditional sense, removing the cell wall with lysozyme should allow them to survive. However, they need some sort of structural support, like option C's mention of external support. So the correct answer must involve the cell wall being removable and providing support. Looking back, option A says bacteria can live without the cell wall in isotonic conditions. This makes sense because bacteria often thrive in environments where there's not much surrounding material, including the cell wall. So the answer should be A.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is A",

From what I remember, cell walls are important for holding things together, like protecting cells from digestion or maintaining structure. First, I think about how cell walls work. Bacteria don't really have cell walls in the same way as plants or animals. They're surrounded by a plasma membrane, which acts kind of like their protective layer. So if you try to remove the cell wall with lysozyme, which is an enzyme that can break down cell walls, would that make a difference? I recall that sometimes when you dig holes, you might see bacteria living there even if they've been removed from their shells. Maybe because their cell walls aren't completely gone? But wait, lysozyme is pretty strong. It can probably cut through the cell wall enough to let the bacteria survive, right? Now, looking at the options, option A says the bacteria can live without the cell wall in an isotonic medium. Isotonic means the solution's osmotic pressure matches the bacterial's protoplasm. I know that bacteria usually thrive in environments where there's not much solute around, so maybe this makes sense. But why specifically isotonic? Does it matter that much? Option B suggests the cell wall is similar to plants but both use cellulose. Wait, no, bacteria's cell wall is made of peptidoglycan, not cellulose. So B is probably incorrect.

    "full_cot": "<|im_start|>user\nAnswer this question step by step with only a single letter. Problem: A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?\n\nA. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nB. The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.\n\nC. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.\n\nD. The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.\n\nE. The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nF. The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.\n\nG. The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.\n\nH. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.\n\nI. The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.\n\nJ. The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.\n\nAnswer with only a single letter.
