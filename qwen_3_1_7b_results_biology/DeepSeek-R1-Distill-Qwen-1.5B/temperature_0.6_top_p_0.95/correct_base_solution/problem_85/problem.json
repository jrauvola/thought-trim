  "problem": "A typical bacterial cell has a cell wall and plasma membrane. If the cell wall is removed by treatment withlysozyme, an enzyme that selectively dissolves the cell wall material, will the bacteria live? Explain. What is the biochemicaldifference between the cell walls of bacteria, and plants?\n\nA. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall in an isotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is equal to the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of insoluble peptidoglycan, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nB. The bacterial cell will immediately die without its cell wall, as the plasma membrane alone cannot withstand osmotic pressure. The cell wall of bacteria is similar to that of plants, both composed of cellulose.\n\nC. The bacterial cell can live without its cell wall as long as it is provided with an external structural support. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates, distinct from the cellulose-based cell walls of plants.\n\nD. The cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of peptidoglycan.\n\nE. The bacterial cell can only live without its cell wall in a hypertonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is higher outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of chitin, while the cell wall in eucaryotes is composed of cellulose.\n\nF. The bacterial cell can survive without its cell wall in a hypotonic medium, where the osmotic pressure is lower outside than inside the bacterial protoplasm. The cell wall of bacteria is made of glycoproteins, in contrast to the cellulose in plant cell walls.\n\nG. The bacterial cell cannot survive without its cell wall in any circumstances.\n\nH. The cell wall of bacteria is composed of lipids.\n\nI. The bacterial cell wall can regenerate quickly after removal, allowing the bacteria to survive without it temporarily. The biochemical difference is that bacterial cell walls have a higher lipid content compared to the cellulose-rich cell walls of plants.\n\nJ. The bacterial cell cannot live without its cell wall because it provides essential nutrients. The cell walls of bacteria are made primarily of lignin, whereas plant cell walls are composed of cellulose and lignin.",
