The products listed are NADP+, ADP, and sugar. Let me think about each option one by one.\n\nFirst, oxidative phosphorylation comes to mind because it's known for producing NADP+ and ADP, which are the reactants in glycolysis. But wait, does it produce sugar? I'm not sure. Maybe it doesn't involve sugar directly. I'll have to keep that in mind.\n\nNext is glycolysis. It starts with glucose, breaks it down into pyruvate, releases NADPH, and produces ATP. So glycolysis definitely involves NADP+ and ADP since those are produced. However, it doesn't make sugar; sugar would come from other sources like starch or glycogen breakdown.\n\nBeta oxidation is related to cellular respiration too, but it specifically refers to the breakdown of fatty acids, so probably not involved here. \n\nChemiosmosis is more about electron transport, which occurs during processes like oxidative phosphorylation, glycolysis, and the Calvin cycle. Not sure if it contributes to making sugar, though.\n\nLight-dependent reactions deal with light-activated proteins and photosynthesis, producing ATP and NADPH, but again, no mention of sugar here.\n\nPyruvate oxidation is another glycolytic step where pyruvate becomes acetyl-CoA, releasing NADCO and generating some energy. Doesn't produce sugar either.\n\nFermentation is a type of anaerobic respiration that converts alcohol into acetaldehyde, using lactate as an alternative energy source. Probably not relevant here.\n\nCalvin cycle is a key part of photosynthesis, converting CO2 into organic molecules, including sugars. Wait, so does the Calvin cycle produce sugars? Yes, it's involved in making sugars through\u6697\u53cd\u5e94\u9636\u6bb5. So maybe the correct answer includes the Calvin cycle.\n\nAnaerobic respiration (option J) can include fermentation and the Krebs cycle. The Krebs cycle produces NADH and carbon dioxide, along with ATP and[H+]. It also produces acetyl-CoA, which goes into the citric acid cycle to produce NADP+. So the Krebs cycle would include sugar production?\n\nWait, let me clarify. The products mentioned are NADP+, ADP, and sugar. So looking at each option:\n\nOption H: Calvin cycle \u2013 yes, it produces sugars.\nOption I: Krebs cycle \u2013 yes, it produces NADH and CO2, but does it produce sugar? No, I don't think so. Instead, it uses the products from glycolysis and pyruvate oxidation to generate NADH and carbon dioxide, leading to the citric acid cycle which produces ATP and CO2.\n\nSo the process involving NADP+, ADP, and sugar must be the Calvin cycle. Therefore, the correct answer is H.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is H",
