  "problem": "What is meant by translocation? What theories have been advanced to explain translocation in plants? Discuss the value and weakness of each.\n\nA. Translocation is the movement of water from the roots to other parts of the plant body\n\nB. Translocation is the transfer of genetic material from one plant to another. Theories explaining this include grafting theory and horizontal gene transfer.\n\nC. Translocation is the process by which plants release oxygen into the atmosphere. Theories include the gas exchange theory and the stomatal pump theory.\n\nD. Theories include the capillary action theory, gravitropism, and the theory of phototropism\n\nE. Translocation is the process by which plants absorb sunlight through their leaves\n\nF. Translocation refers to the growth of new plant shoots in the spring\n\nG. Theories explaining translocation include the phloem loading theory, auxin transport theory, and the electric potential gradient theory\n\nH. Translocation is the process of photosynthesis\n\nI. Translocation is the movement of nutrients from the leaves to other parts of the plant body. Theories to explain this include the pressure-flow theory, cyclosis, and the theory of cytoplasmic tubules.\n\nJ. Theories include the diffusion theory, osmosis, and the theory of cellular respiration",
