The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the 16% are the only ones who can't roll, meaning they're homozygous recessives, and the rest are either heterozygotes or dominant carriers.

So, yes, 48% would be correct, which is option F. However, looking back at the options, option G is 68%, which might correspond to something else. Maybe I misread the percentages. Let me check again: 16% can't roll (tt), so q\u00b2=0.16 \u2192 q=0.4 \u2192 p=0.6. Heterozygotes are 2pq=0.48, so 48% of the students are heterozygous. Therefore, the answer should be F, 48%. But since the user included multiple letters, perhaps I missed something. Alternatively, maybe the question is phrased differently. Wait, the question states that 16% cannot roll their tongue, which is the recessive phenotype. So, the remaining 84% do roll their tongue, which includes both heterozygotes (can roll) and homozygotes (can roll). So, the percentage of students who can roll is 84%, and among them, some are homozygous dominant (TT) and others are heterozygous (Tt). Using Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of TT is p\u00b2=0.6\u00b2=0.36, which is 36%, and the frequency of Tt is 2pq=0.48, which is 48%. So, adding 36% and 48% gives 84%, which matches the 84% who can roll their tongue. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygous students is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, q\u00b2 equals the frequency of the tt genotype, which is 16%, or 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us 0.4. Then, p, the frequency of the dominant allele, is 1 - q = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but none of the options after A to J match that exactly. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question assumes that the frequency of expressing the trait (rolling the tongue) is different. But no, the recessive trait isn't expressed, so all non-tt individuals are heterozygotes. So, 100% minus the tt individuals should give the percentage of heterozygotes plus the homozygous dominant. Since 16% are tt, then 84% are either TT or Tt. However, since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, not including the homozygous dominant, which is TT. So, how do we calculate just the heterozygote percentage? Well, using the formula, we found that 2pq is 48%, but wait, that includes the TT individuals. So, actually, the total percentage of people who can roll their tongue (TT + Tt) is 100% - 16% = 84%. We already know that TT is p\u00b2 = 0.36 (since p=0.6, p\u00b2=0.36) and Tt is 2pq = 0.48. Adding them together gives 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84, which matches the 84% that can roll their tongue. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48% (Tt), which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). We know that q\u00b2 equals 16%, which is 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, p is 1 - q, so p = 0.6. Now, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq), we substitute p and q into the equation: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that gives us 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but none of the options include 48%, so maybe I made a mistake. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of people who can roll their tongues, which would be all individuals except the homozygous recessives. That would be 100% minus 16%, which is 84%. But that's not one of the options either. Hmm, maybe I should double-check my calculations. Oh, wait!

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). We know that q\u00b2 equals 16%, which means q is the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4 or 40%. Then, p, the frequency of the dominant allele, would be 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%. To find the percentage of heterozygotes, we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. Wait, but that seems too high compared to the options provided. Let me double-check my calculations. Oh, wait, no\u2014the options don't include 48%, but option F is 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of people who can roll their tongues, not the heterozygous ones.

If 16% are tt, then the number of heterozygotes would be 2pq = 2*(0.96)*(0.04) = 0.0768, which is 7.68% of the population. But that's the proportion of heterozygotes, not the actual number. Wait, no\u2014the question is about the percentage of students who are heterozygous, which is the same as the proportion of heterozygotes in the population. So 7.68% is the proportion, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is option G, 68%, which represents the combined frequency of TT and Tt.

One suggests 7.68% heterozygotes, another 48% total non-tt. Which is it? Wait, no\u2014the question is asking specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. So if 16% are tt, then 84% are either TT or Tt. The heterozygote frequency is 2pq=76.8%, but that's the proportion of heterozygotes relative to the entire population. However, the question is phrased as \"what percentage of students are heterozygous?\" which refers to the actual number of heterozygous individuals. But without additional context like allele frequencies, we can't determine the absolute percentage unless we assume Hardy-Weinberg. Since the question doesn't specify any deviations from Hardy-Weinberg, I'll proceed under that assumption. Thus, the percentage of heterozygotes is 76.8%, but that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is asking for the proportion of the non-tt individuals who are heterozygotes. If that's the case, then the proportion would be (2pq)/(p\u00b2 + 2pq) = (2*0.96*0.04)/(0.0016 + 0.0768) = 0.0768 / 0.0784 \u2248 97.6%, which also isn't an option. This is confusing. Maybe I should look at the options again. Option G is 68%, which could represent the sum of TT (p\u00b2=0.36=36%) and Tt (2pq=76.8%), totaling 112.8%, which is more than 100%, so that's impossible. Option D is 40%, which doesn't fit. Option J is 52%, which is closer but not matching. Option E is 20%, which is half of 40. Option B is 32%, which is less than 48%. Option A is 36%, which is the proportion of TT. Option C is 24%, which is too low. Option F is 48%, which is the total non-tt. So the correct answer based on the assumption that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is that 76.8% are heterozygotes, but that's not an option. However, considering that 16% are tt, the remaining 84% includes heterozygotes and TT. If the question is asking for the percentage of the entire student body that are heterozygous, including the TT, then it's 76.8%. But since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer is option G, 68%, thinking that it's the sum of the non-tt plus some other factor. Alternatively, maybe the question is using a different model. Another thought: perhaps the question assumes that the 16% are heterozygotes themselves, but that contradicts the statement. Alternatively, maybe the question uses the term \"cannot roll their tongue\" to mean homozygous recessive, and thus 16% are recessive, implying that the frequency of the recessive allele is sqrt(16%)=4%, making the heterozygous frequency 2pq=76.8%, but again, that's not an option. Alternatively, perhaps the question is simply asking for the percentage of heterozygotes in terms of the non-tt, which would be 76.8/84\u224891.4%, but that's not an option either. I'm stuck here. Maybe I should conclude that the correct answer is 76.8%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the closest is option G, 68%, but I'm not confident.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive).",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, q\u00b2 represents the 16% who can't roll their tongue. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which equals 0.4 or 40%. So, q = 0.4. Then, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, using these values, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, q\u00b2 = 0.16 because 16% can't roll their tongue. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Then, p is 1 - q, so p = 0.6.
