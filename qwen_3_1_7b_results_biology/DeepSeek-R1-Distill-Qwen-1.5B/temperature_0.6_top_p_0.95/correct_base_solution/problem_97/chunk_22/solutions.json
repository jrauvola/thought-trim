    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, multiplied by 2 is indeed 0.48, which is 48%. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then, 2pq is indeed 0.48, which translates to 48% heterozygotes. Looking back at the options provided: A.36, B.32, C.24, D.40, E.20, F.48, G.68, H.16, I.64, J.52, K.68, L.16, M.40, N.52. So, option F is 48%, which matches our calculation. Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know p\u00b2 is 0.16, so 0.16 + 2pq + 0.25 = 1? Wait, no, wait. If q=0.4, then p=0.6, so p\u00b2=0.36, not 0.16. Oh, I see, I made a mistake earlier. Because if q\u00b2=0.16, then q=0.4, so p=0.6. Therefore, p\u00b2=0.36, which is the frequency of the dominant homozygotes. Then, 2pq=2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is the heterozygote frequency. And q\u00b2=0.16, so total would be 0.36+0.48+0.16=1.0, which adds up correctly. So, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

    "prefix_without_chunk": "Okay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.",

Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense.

Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then 2pq would indeed be 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%, right? Hmm, but looking back at the options, there's an option F which is 48%. But wait, another way to think about it: if 16% are not expressing the trait, that could mean either 16% are homozygous recessive or maybe some other distribution, but according to Hardy-Weinberg, it should be exactly 2q\u00b2 for q\u00b2. So, yeah, 16% is q\u00b2, leading to q=0.4, p=0.6, and 2pq=48%. So, the correct answer should be F.48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6.

Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then, using p = 0.6, the heterozygote frequency is indeed 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So looking at the options provided, option F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes usually express the dominant trait, so they would be able to roll their tongues. In a population following Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are given by p\u00b2 (homozygous dominant), 2pq (heterozygous), and q\u00b2 (homozygous recessive). Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since 16% of the students are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), then p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, p = 0.6, which represents the frequency of the dominant allele. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt), we calculate 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on. I thought 16% was the homozygous recessive. But let me double-check: yes, since 0.4 squared is 0.16, that makes sense. Then, 2*0.6*0.4 is indeed 0.48, which is 48%. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the correct answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",
