Wait, but that seems too high compared to some of the options provided. Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the percentages.\n\nWait another thought: The total percentage of students without the dominant trait (tt) is 16%, so the rest (84%) do have at least one dominant allele. Among these, the proportion of heterozygotes would depend on the dominance ratio. However, in most cases, the heterozygote is more common than the homozygotes. For example, if the dominant allele is fully dominant, then the heterozygote would be more frequent. In our case, the recessive trait is not expressed unless both alleles are recessive, so the heterozygote would be more likely than the homozygote.\n\nBut according to my earlier calculation using Hardy-Weinberg, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%. Looking back at the answer choices, option F is 48 percent. However, the initial assumption might be incorrect because sometimes in such problems, the actual calculation might yield a different result depending on whether the allele is completely dominant or partially dominant, but in this case, it's stated as dominant, meaning the heterozygote is more fit and thus more common.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the correct answer should be 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, they want to know the percentage of students who are heterozygous (Tt). Heterozygotes are carriers of the trait but do not exhibit it themselves. In a population, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg principle to calculate the frequencies of each genotype. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t), p\u00b2 is the frequency of TT, 2pq is the frequency of Tt, and q\u00b2 is the frequency of tt.\n\nSince 16% of the students are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Now, knowing that p + q = 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This means the frequency of the dominant allele T is 60%.\n\nNext, we need to find the frequency of the heterozygous individuals, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that would be 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating this gives 2 * 0.24 = 0.48, or 48%. \n\nWait, let me double-check that math. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and doubling that does give 0.48. So, out of 100%, 48% of the students are heterozygous. That makes sense because the majority of people should carry at least one dominant allele, except for the very small percentages at the extremes. \n\nSo, looking back at the options provided, option F is 48 percent, which matches our calculation. Therefore, the answer should be F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Because in a diploid organism, each person has two alleles. So, the number of 't's is 16% divided by 2, which is 8%. That means the frequency of the dominant allele 'T' would be 92%, because 100% - 8% = 92%.\n\nNext, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt), we use the formula for the frequency of heterozygotes in a diploid population. The formula is 2pq, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Plugging in the numbers, that's 2 * 92% * 8%.

Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele p is 1 - q, which would be 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNext, I want to find the frequency of the heterozygous individuals, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values, p is 0.6 and q is 0.4, so 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I get confused with multiplication. 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. Yes, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together: 16% are tt (homozygous recessive), 48% are Tt (heterozygous), and the remaining 36% are TT (homozygous dominant). Adding these up (36 + 48 + 16) gives 100%, which checks out. \n\nWait, hold on, did I mix up something? Because the question asks specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not any other category. So, based on my calculations, it's 48% heterozygous. Looking at the options provided: A is 36, B is 32, C is 24, D is 40, E is 20, F is 48, G is 68, H is 16, I is 64, J is 52, K is none. So, option F is 48%, which matches my answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, if q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q is 0.4, making p = 0.6. Then p\u00b2 = 0.36, which represents the TT genotype. Adding them together: 0.36 (TT) + 0.48 (Tt) + 0.16 (tt) = 1. So yes, that checks out. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygotes is indeed 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

To find out how many students are heterozygous, I think I need to use the Hardy-Weinberg equation because it helps calculate genotype frequencies based on allele frequencies. The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t), and pq is the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nSince all individuals without the dominant trait are tt, which is q\u00b2, we know that q\u00b2 equals 0.16 because 16% can't roll their tongue. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us q = 0.4. Then, since the sum of p and q equals 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6.

Hmm, actually, wait a second, maybe I made a mistake there. Because 48% heterozygotes plus 16% homozygous recessives equals 64%, leaving 36% as the remaining homozygous dominant (TT). But the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, so it's 48%. However, looking at the options provided, F is 48%, which matches my calculation. But wait, earlier I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people get confused between calculating the percentage of heterozygotes versus the total expression of the trait. In this case, the total percentage expressing the trait (either TT or Tt) is 100% minus the percentage not expressing it, which is 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, according to the Hardy-Weinberg, the proportion of individuals expressing the trait (TT and Tt) is p\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2. Here, p\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, which is 84%. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the ones expressing the trait. So, from before, we calculated 48%, which corresponds to option F. But let me ensure I didn't mix up anything. Yes, heterozygotes are indeed 2pq, which is 48%. So the correct answer should be F. 48%.\n\nWait, hold on, another approach: if 16% cannot roll their tongue, that's q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6.

The Hardy-Weinberg equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t), and pq is the frequency of heterozygotes.\n\nSince all individuals without the dominant trait are tt, which is q\u00b2, we know that q\u00b2 equals 0.16 because 16% can't roll their tongue. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us q = 0.4. Then, since the sum of p and q equals 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, using these values, we can find the frequency of heterozygotes, which is 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. That means 48% of the students are heterozygous (Tt).\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If 48% are heterozygotes and 16% are homozygous recessives, then adding them together gives 64%, which should account for all students\u2014since 100% - 64% = 36% would be heterozygotes. Hmm, actually, wait a second, maybe I made a mistake there. Because 48% heterozygotes plus 16% homozygous recessives equals 64%, leaving 36% as the remaining homozygous dominant (TT). But the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, so it's 48%. However, looking at the options provided, F is 48%, which matches my calculation. But wait, earlier I thought the answer might be different. Let me check again.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes people get confused between calculating the percentage of heterozygotes versus the total expression of the trait. In this case, the total percentage expressing the trait (either TT or Tt) is 100% minus the percentage not expressing it, which is 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, according to the Hardy-Weinberg, the proportion of individuals expressing the trait (TT and Tt) is p\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - q\u00b2. Here, p\u00b2 + 2pq = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84, which is 84%. \n\nBut wait, the question is asking specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the ones expressing the trait. So, from before, we calculated 48%, which corresponds to option F. But let me ensure I didn't mix up anything. Yes, heterozygotes are indeed 2pq, which is 48%. So the correct answer should be F. 48%.\n\nWait, hold on, another approach: if 16% cannot roll their tongue, that's q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4. Then p = 0.6. The number of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. So yes, F is correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Assuming equal distribution, half of 84% would be carriers, but that would be 42%, which still isn't an option. Alternatively, maybe the calculation uses different assumptions, such as assuming all carriers are heterozygotes, but that doesn't make sense because some could be TT.\n\nWait, perhaps the initial assumption was wrong. Maybe the recessive phenotype is not just tt, but also another condition, but that seems unlikely. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of individuals who can roll their tongue, including carriers and the dominant ones. In that case, the percentage would be (TT + Tt) = (p\u00b2 + 2pq) = (0.6\u00b2 + 2*0.6*0.4) = 0.36 + 0.48 = 0.84, which is 84%. But the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, not those who can roll. So, back to that, 48% is the correct figure, but it's not among the options.

To solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype frequencies under certain assumptions.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the frequency of the dominant allele (T). Since 16% are tt, that means 84% of the population has at least one T allele. In the Hardy-Weinberg equation, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Here, q\u00b2 = 0.16 because 16% are tt. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. \n\nSince p + q = 1 (the sum of all allele frequencies equals 100%), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele T is 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNext, the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options don't include 48% as correct? Or do they? Let me check the answer choices. Oh, option F is 48%, so maybe that's the right answer. But wait, did I make a mistake somewhere? Because 16% are tt, which is q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q=0.4, p=0.6. Then heterozygotes are 2pq = 0.48, which is 48%.\n\nBut wait, another way to look at it is using the total percentage. The total percentage accounted for by the three genotypes should add up to 100%. We know tt is 16%, so the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the proportion of TT is p\u00b2 = 0.36 (since p=0.6), and Tt is 2pq = 0.48. Adding them together: 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.0, which checks out. So yes, 48% are heterozygotes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Alternatively, maybe using another approach. If 16% are tt, then the frequency of the dominant allele is 84% / 2, which is 42%, because each individual has two alleles. So, p = 42%, q = 16% (since 42% + 16% = 58%, which doesn't add up; perhaps my method was incorrect). Wait, actually, the correct way is that the frequency of the dominant allele is equal to the sum of the frequencies of the heterozygote and the homozygous dominant divided by two.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, the next part is asking about the percentage of students who are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. To find this out, I remember that in a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Here, since all students either have TT or tt, the total is 100%, so p\u00b2 + q\u00b2 = 1.\n\nGiven that q\u00b2 equals the percentage of students who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%. So q\u00b2 = 16%, which means q is the square root of 0.16. Calculating that, sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, so q = 0.4. That makes sense because q represents the proportion of the population that has the recessive trait.\n\nSince we know that p + q = 1 (because these are the only two possible alleles), we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the recessive one.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes, which would be represented by 2pq in the Hardy-Weinberg formula.

Now, using the Hardy-Weinberg formula again, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) is calculated as 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me do that multiplication: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, and 1.2 * 0.4 is 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%. Wait, but I think I might have made a mistake somewhere because sometimes these calculations can be tricky. Let me double-check. If q\u00b2 is 0.16, then q is indeed 0.4, and p is 0.6. Then 2pq is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. But looking back at the options, F is 48 percent. However, I recall another approach where sometimes the total population includes all genotypes, so maybe there's an alternative way to calculate it. Alternatively, since the sum of all genotypes is 100%, and we already accounted for the tt genotype as 16%, the remaining 84% (which is 100% - 16%) represents the TT and Tt genotypes combined. Since the ratio of TT:Tt in a heterozygote scenario is 1:1, each contributes half of the remaining 84%, which would be 42% for each. Adding the 42% from Tt and the 16% from tt, we get 58%, but that doesn't match any option except G, which is 68%. Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The initial calculation gave 48%, but perhaps I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg formula. Alternatively, maybe the correct answer is 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele.

But wait, actually, since the presence of even one dominant allele will result in the trait, everyone except the tt genotype can roll their tongue. So, the percentage of people who can roll their tongue is 100% - 16% = 84%. \n\nBut how does that relate to the number of heterozygotes? Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Using the formula for heterozygosity, which is 2pq. We already found p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, so 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we're supposed to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous (Tt). Heterozygotes are carriers of the trait because they have one dominant and one recessive allele. In such cases, they will express the dominant trait (roll tongue), which makes sense because they don't show the recessive phenotype.\n\nTo solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that the frequency of genotypes in a population at equilibrium can be calculated using p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). \n\nGiven that 16% of the students are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since the sum of p and q equals 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6. Now, we want to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but wait a second\u2014hold on. That would mean 48% are heterozygotes. However, looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%, which seems correct. But I'm a bit confused because sometimes people might make a mistake in interpreting the numbers. Let me double-check my calculations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that the total percentage of people who can roll their tongue includes both the heterozygotes and the homozygous dominant (TT). Since 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) are TT or Tt. But wait, actually, since the presence of even one dominant allele will result in the trait, everyone except the tt genotype can roll their tongue. So, the percentage of people who can roll their tongue is 100% - 16% = 84%. \n\nBut how does that relate to the number of heterozygotes? Hmm, perhaps another approach is needed. Using the formula for heterozygosity, which is 2pq. We already found p = 0.6 and q = 0.4, so 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. So, that confirms it. Therefore, the percentage of heterozygous students is 48%.\n\nWait, but earlier I thought maybe I was missing something because the options included 48% as an option, which seems right. However, the assistant initially suggested 48% as option F. But hold on, I just realized\u2014the question asks specifically for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, not the percentage who can roll their tongue. Oh, no, wait\u2014the percentage who are heterozygous would still include all the heterozygotes, regardless of whether they can roll their tongue or not. Because even though they can't roll their tongue, they can still pass the trait onto others. So, yes, 48% of the students are heterozygotes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer should be F. 48 percent.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and pq is the frequency of the heterozygotes.\n\nSince all the students either have TT, Tt, or tt genotypes, and we know the frequency of tt is 16%, which is q\u00b2. We can set up the equation:\n\nq\u00b2 = 16% => q = \u221a(16%) = 4%.\n\nSo, the frequency of the recessive allele is 4%. Now, since the sum of p and q equals 1 (because they are the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 4% = 96%. Wait, but that seems high because 96% of the students would have at least one dominant allele.

So, p = 96%, meaning 96% have at least one dominant allele, and 4% are homozygous recessives. That makes sense because the recessive phenotype is rare.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * p * q = 2 * 96% * 4% = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 2 * 0.0384 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nBut wait, none of the options provided include 7.68%. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me think again. Oh, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of individuals with each genotype directly.\n\nThe total population is 100 students. 16% (16 students) have tt. The remaining 84% (84 students) can express the dominant trait. In the Hardy-Weinberg model, the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq. So, 2*0.96*0.04=0.0768, which is approximately 7.68 students, which rounds to 8 students. But looking back at the options, there's no 8% option. The closest is 24%, which might correspond to something else. Maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait another thought\u2014perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, which would be 2pq. So, 2*(0.96)*(0.04)=0.0768, which is 7.68%, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. Perhaps using phenotypic ratios instead of allelic frequencies. If 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we're asked to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so their genotype would be Tt. To figure this out, I'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that in a large population, the frequencies of alleles and genotypes remain constant from generation to generation. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the frequency of the recessive allele, and pq is the frequency of the heterozygotes.\n\nSince all the students either have TT, Tt, or tt genotypes, and we know the frequency of tt is 16%, which is q\u00b2. We can set up the equation:\n\nq\u00b2 = 16% => q = \u221a(16%) = 4%.\n\nSo, the frequency of the recessive allele is 4%. Now, since the sum of p and q equals 1 (because they are the only two alleles), p = 1 - q = 1 - 4% = 96%. Wait, but that seems high because 96% of the students would have at least one dominant allele. But maybe I should double-check my calculations.\n\nWait, no, actually, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, not the percentage of the population. So, p = 96%, meaning 96% have at least one dominant allele, and 4% are homozygous recessives. That makes sense because the recessive phenotype is rare.\n\nNow, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * p * q = 2 * 96% * 4% = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 2 * 0.0384 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%.\n\nBut wait, none of the options provided include 7.68%. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me think again. Oh, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, maybe I should calculate the number of individuals with each genotype directly.\n\nThe total population is 100 students. 16% (16 students) have tt. The remaining 84% (84 students) can express the dominant trait. In the Hardy-Weinberg model, the proportion of heterozygotes is 2pq. So, 2*0.96*0.04=0.0768, which is approximately 7.68 students, which rounds to 8 students. But looking back at the options, there's no 8% option. The closest is 24%, which might correspond to something else. Maybe I messed up the calculation.\n\nWait another thought\u2014perhaps the question is asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, which would be 2pq. So, 2*(0.96)*(0.04)=0.0768, which is 7.68%, but the options don't have that. Alternatively, maybe the question expects a different approach. Perhaps using phenotypic ratios instead of allelic frequencies. If 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming random mating, the ratio of TT:Tt would be 3:1 based on the Punnett square. So, 75% would be Tt and 25% TT. Thus, 75% of 84% is 63%, which isn't an option either. This suggests I'm still off track.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the 16% includes both the homozygous and heterozygous cases. No, because the recessive phenotype is only present in homozygotes. So, 16% are tt, and the rest are either TT or Tt. Using the Hardy-Weinberg formula correctly, 16% = q\u00b2 => q=0.4, so p=0.6.

To do this, I should probably use the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since the recessive phenotype is tt, q\u00b2 equals the proportion of students who are tt. We know that q\u00b2 is 0.16 because 16% can't roll their tongue. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4.\n\nNext, since p + q = 1 (because all alleles add up to one), p would be 1 - q, which is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (which is 2pq), I multiply 2 by p and q. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg principles here. Maybe I need to consider more factors, like phenotypic ratios versus genotypic frequencies. Or perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. If 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the number of individuals with at least one T allele (either TT or Tt) is 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, using the Hardy-Weinberg principle again, the sum of the squares plus twice the product equals 1. So, we already know q\u00b2 = 0.16, thus q = 0.4, and p = 0.6. Then, the number of heterozygotes would be 2pq = 0.48, which is 48%. However, when adding up the percentages, we get 25% (TT) + 48% (Tt) + 16% (tt) = 89%, which is still short of 100%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. To do this, I should probably use the Hardy-Weinberg equation, which is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since the recessive phenotype is tt, q\u00b2 equals the proportion of students who are tt. We know that q\u00b2 is 0.16 because 16% can't roll their tongue. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4.\n\nNext, since p + q = 1 (because all alleles add up to one), p would be 1 - q, which is 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (which is 2pq), I multiply 2 by p and q. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on, let me double-check. If 48% are heterozygotes, then the percentages adding up would be 25% (homozygous T), 48% (hetero), and 16% (homozygous t), which adds up to 90%, not 100%. That suggests I might have made a mistake somewhere.\n\nWait, no, actually, wait. Because 2pq is the correct formula for heterozygotes. So, maybe I should recalculate. With p=0.6 and q=0.4:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16, correct.\np = 1 - q = 0.6, correct.\nSo, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But wait, when I add them up: 25% (TT), 48% (Tt), and 16% (tt), that totals 89%, which is less than 100%. Hmm, that means there's an error in my calculation or understanding. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the Hardy-Weinberg principles here. Maybe I need to consider more factors, like phenotypic ratios versus genotypic frequencies. Or perhaps the initial assumption is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. If 16% can't roll their tongue (tt), then the number of individuals with at least one T allele (either TT or Tt) is 100% - 16% = 84%. Now, using the Hardy-Weinberg principle again, the sum of the squares plus twice the product equals 1. So, we already know q\u00b2 = 0.16, thus q = 0.4, and p = 0.6. Then, the number of heterozygotes would be 2pq = 0.48, which is 48%. However, when adding up the percentages, we get 25% (TT) + 48% (Tt) + 16% (tt) = 89%, which is still short of 100%. This discrepancy suggests that either the assumptions aren't met perfectly, or perhaps the scenario is hypothetical without considering other factors like environmental influences. \n\nBut given the information provided, according to the Hardy-Weinberg equations, the percentage of heterozygotes should be 48%, which isn't among the options directly.

Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (as allele frequencies sum up to 100%), we can solve for p. Subtracting q from 1 gives p = 0.6. Now, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (which would be 2pq), we multiply p by q and then double it. So:\n\np * q = 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24\nThen, 2 * 0.24 = 0.48 or 48%.\n\nWait a second, but hold on. The question is about students who can't roll their tongue, meaning they're either tt or TT? No, wait, no\u2014tt cannot roll, but TT can roll. Wait, no\u2014that's not right. Wait, the dominant trait is rolling the tongue, so anyone with at least one T allele will be able to roll. So, the recessive condition (tt) means they can't. Therefore, the number of heterozygotes (Tt) would be the remaining percentage after accounting for TT and tt.\n\nLet me recalculate to make sure I didn't get confused. Total population is 100%. We know that 16% are tt (homozygous recessive). The rest, which is 84%, are either TT or Tt. But since the dominant trait is expressed when there's at least one T, all individuals except tt are either TT or Tt. However, in terms of genotype frequencies under Hardy-Weinberg, the total is 100%, so the heterozygote frequency is 2pq, which is 48% as per earlier calculation. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%, which matches option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Because in a diploid organism, each parent passes one allele, so the probability of passing T from one parent is 0.6, and t is 0.4. So, the chance of getting T from one parent and t from the other is 0.6*0.4=0.24, and similarly for t and T, another 0.24. Adding them together gives 0.48, which matches the 48% calculation.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous. Heterozygotes would look like Tt. In a Hardy-Weinberg population, the frequencies of these genotypes follow certain ratios based on p and q, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Since 16% are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. That makes sense because each parent contributes one allele, so the chance of getting a t from either parent is 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele 'T' is 0.6. Now, we can use the Hardy-Weinberg equation to find the frequency of the heterozygous genotype, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values, we get 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me calculate that: 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48.

Since 16% are tt, each person has two t alleles. In the Hardy-Weinberg formula, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out how many students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. In such cases, they can roll their tongue, which explains why the majority of students don't have the tt genotype.\n\nLet's think about the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which applies here since the traits are inherited randomly without any selection or mutation. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t), p\u00b2 represents the frequency of homozygous dominant individuals, 2pq is the frequency of heterozygotes, and q\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous recessives.\n\nGiven that 16% of the students are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes (2pq) is 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.48. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous.\n\nWait a second, but let me make sure I didn't mix up anything. The total population would then be p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2. Plugging in the numbers: 0.36 (from p\u00b2=0.6\u00b2=0.36) plus 0.48 (heterozygotes) plus 0.16 (tt) equals exactly 1. That checks out, so my calculation seems correct.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygotes (Tt). Heterozygotes are the ones who carry one dominant and one recessive allele. To find the frequency of heterozygotes, I remember that in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies follow certain rules. Specifically, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. In this case, since 16% are tt (q\u00b2), we can solve for q first.\n\nLet me calculate q. Since q squared equals 0.16, taking the square root gives q = 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele t is 40%. Now, knowing that p plus q equals 1 (since all alleles sum up to 100%), p would be 0.6 or 60%. This tells us that 60% of the students have at least one dominant allele (either T or t).\n\nNext, to find the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is represented by 2pq, we plug in the values. Here, p is 0.6 and q is 0.4. Multiplying them together gives 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, it's 48%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused between calculating phenotypic ratios versus genotype frequencies. The question asks specifically about heterozygotes, so using the formula 2pq makes sense. Also, considering that 16% are tt, adding up p\u00b2 (0.36) and 2pq (0.48) and q\u00b2 (0.16) should give 1. Indeed, 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 equals exactly 1, so everything checks out.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, the question asks what percentage of students are heterozygous. Heterozygous would mean they have one T and one t allele. In terms of probability, since 16% are tt, the remaining 84% must account for all other possible genotypes. But wait, in a diploid organism like humans, each person has two alleles, so the total possible combinations are TT, Tt, and tt. We already know that tt makes up 16%, so the remaining 84% needs to add up between the other two genotypes.\n\nSince the trait is dominant, any presence of at least one T means the student can roll their tongue. So, the possible genotypes that express the trait are TT and Tt. The frequency of these can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which states that p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nGiven that q\u00b2 = 16%, we can find q by taking the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4, meaning the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%. Consequently, the frequency of the dominant allele (p) is 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%.\n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of the heterozygous genotype (Tt) is 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on a second\u2014did I interpret the question correctly? It said 16% cannot roll their tongue, which corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16, leading to q=0.4. Then, the heterozygous frequency would be 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%.

Maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check. Oh no, wait! Actually, the correct approach is that the total frequency of all genotypes should add up to 100%.

The total population isn't necessarily 100%, but since we're dealing with percentages, it's fine. However, the issue arises when calculating the sum. Let me check again:\n\nTT = 0.96^2 = 0.9216 (92.16%)\ntt = 0.04^2 = 0.0016 (0.16%)\nTt = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768 (7.68%)\n\nTotal = 92.16 + 0.16 + 7.68 = 100% exactly.

The number of heterozygotes depends on the allele frequencies.\n\nWait, another approach: if 16% cannot roll their tongue (tt), then the frequency of t alleles is sqrt(16%) = 4%, as before. Then, the frequency of T alleles is 1 - 0.04 = 96%. The proportion of heterozygotes is 2 * (frequency of T) * (frequency of t) = 2 * 0.96 * 0.04 = 0.0768, which is 7.68%, or ~7.7%.

To solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% of the students are tt, that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16.

Using the equation for TT, which is p\u00b2 = 0.84, taking the square root gives p \u2248 0.9165.

Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, no. Actually, if 16% are tt, then the frequency of the dominant allele (p) should be higher than q. Since q\u00b2 = 0.16, q=0.4, p=0.6. Then, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But wait, the sum of all genotypes should equal 100%. So, 48% heterozygotes + 16% tt = 64%, leaving 36% for the two TT cases. That adds up correctly because 0.6^2 + 2*(0.6)(0.4) + 0.4^2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So, yes, 48% heterozygotes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of the students are heterozygous. Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so their genotype would be Tt. To solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.\n\nSince 16% of the students are tt, that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. This means the frequency of the recessive allele (q) is 40%. Now, since p + q = 1, p = 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNext, we want to find the frequency of the heterozygotes (Tt), which is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, we get 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me make sure I didn't mix up any numbers. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the total percentage of affected individuals. Those who can't roll their tongue are either TT or tt. We know tt is 16%, so the remaining 84% are TT. Using the equation for TT, which is p\u00b2 = 0.84, taking the square root gives p \u2248 0.9165. Then, the heterozygotes would be 2pq, which is 2 * 0.9165 * 0.0835 \u2248 0.156, or 15.6%, which rounds to approximately 16%. Hmm, that contradicts my earlier calculation. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, no. Actually, if 16% are tt, then the frequency of the dominant allele (p) should be higher than q. Since q\u00b2 = 0.16, q=0.4, p=0.6. Then, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But wait, the sum of all genotypes should equal 100%. So, 48% heterozygotes + 16% tt = 64%, leaving 36% for the two TT cases. That adds up correctly because 0.6^2 + 2*(0.6)(0.4) + 0.4^2 = 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So, yes, 48% heterozygotes.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is G",

So, our goal is to find the frequency of Tt individuals in the population.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many people are either TT or Tt. We know that 16% are tt. In a population, the sum of all genotypes equals 100%, so:\n\nTT + Tt + tt = 100%\n\nWe already know tt is 16%, so:\n\nTT + Tt = 84%\n\nBut without more information, we can't directly determine the distribution between TT and Tt. However, in cases like this, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium often holds true, especially since there's no mention of any other factors affecting allele frequencies. Under Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nSince the recessive phenotype (tt) is 16%, that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Then, p = 1 - q = 0.6. \n\nNext, calculate the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%.\n\nWait a minute, but hold on. That would mean 48% of the students are heterozygous. But let me double-check my calculations. If q is 0.4, then p is indeed 0.6. Multiplying them gives 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48, which is 48%. But looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%, which seems to fit. However, I recall that sometimes in problems like this, the calculation might involve different assumptions, such as considering only the carriers rather than all individuals expressing the trait. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in interpreting the initial data.\n\nWait another thought: If 16% cannot roll their tongue (tt), that's 16% of the population. The rest, 84%, includes both TT and Tt. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of T (p) is 0.6 and t (q) is 0.4. Thus, the heterozygote frequency should be 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. But none of the answer choices include 48% except option F. However, in some textbooks, the percentage of heterozygotes is often reported differently under certain conditions. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the fact that the number of carriers (heterozygotes) is equal to the proportion who can roll their tongue minus the proportion who cannot, divided by two. Wait, the total proportion of people who can roll their tongue is 84%, so the proportion who can't is 16%. The heterozygotes are those who can roll their tongue but don't have the recessive trait. So, the heterozygote frequency would be (proportion who can roll - proportion who cannot)/2. That would be (84% - 16%)/2 = 68%/2 = 34%. Hmm, that's not matching exactly, but wait, this approach might be incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual Hardy-Weinberg proportions correctly.\n\nLet me clarify: The proportion of individuals who can roll their tongue (TT + Tt) is 84%. The proportion who cannot (tt) is 16%. The frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) can be found using the formula 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48, which is 48%. This aligns with option F, but earlier reasoning suggested 34% if subtracted from 84%, which isn't correct because subtraction alone doesn't account for the correct formula.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the Hardy-Weinberg result, the heterozygote frequency is 48%, so the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous (Tt). Heterozygotes can express the dominant trait, which means they can roll their tongue. So, our goal is to find the frequency of Tt individuals in the population.\n\nFirst, let's figure out how many people are either TT or Tt. We know that 16% are tt. In a population, the sum of all genotypes equals 100%, so:\n\nTT + Tt + tt = 100%\n\nWe already know tt is 16%, so:\n\nTT + Tt = 84%\n\nBut without more information, we can't directly determine the distribution between TT and Tt. However, in cases like this, assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium often holds true, especially since there's no mention of any other factors affecting allele frequencies. Under Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t).\n\nSince the recessive phenotype (tt) is 16%, that corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Then, p = 1 - q = 0.6. \n\nNext, calculate the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt), which is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values:\n\n2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%.\n\nWait a minute, but hold on. That would mean 48% of the students are heterozygous. But let me double-check my calculations. If q is 0.4, then p is indeed 0.6. Multiplying them gives 0.24, and doubling that gives 0.48, which is 48%. But looking back at the options provided, option F is 48%, which seems to fit. However, I recall that sometimes in problems like this, the calculation might involve different assumptions, such as considering only the carriers rather than all individuals expressing the trait. Alternatively, maybe I made an error in interpreting the initial data.\n\nWait another thought: If 16% cannot roll their tongue (tt), that's 16% of the population. The rest, 84%, includes both TT and Tt. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of T (p) is 0.6 and t (q) is 0.4. Thus, the heterozygote frequency should be 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. But none of the answer choices include 48% except option F. However, in some textbooks, the percentage of heterozygotes is often reported differently under certain conditions. Maybe I'm missing something here.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question expects us to use the fact that the number of carriers (heterozygotes) is equal to the proportion who can roll their tongue minus the proportion who cannot, divided by two. Wait, the total proportion of people who can roll their tongue is 84%, so the proportion who can't is 16%. The heterozygotes are those who can roll their tongue but don't have the recessive trait. So, the heterozygote frequency would be (proportion who can roll - proportion who cannot)/2. That would be (84% - 16%)/2 = 68%/2 = 34%. Hmm, that's not matching exactly, but wait, this approach might be incorrect because it doesn't account for the actual Hardy-Weinberg proportions correctly.\n\nLet me clarify: The proportion of individuals who can roll their tongue (TT + Tt) is 84%. The proportion who cannot (tt) is 16%. The frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) can be found using the formula 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48, which is 48%. This aligns with option F, but earlier reasoning suggested 34% if subtracted from 84%, which isn't correct because subtraction alone doesn't account for the correct formula.\n\nTherefore, sticking with the Hardy-Weinberg result, the heterozygote frequency is 48%, so the correct answer is F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

To find this out, we'll need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps predict allele frequencies in a population under certain assumptions. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). In this case, since q\u00b2 equals the proportion of homozygous recessives, which is 16%, we can solve for q.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of both sides gives q = 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (t) is 40%. Now, knowing that p + q = 1 (since these are the only two alleles), p would be 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNext, the percentage of heterozygotes (the 2pq term) is calculated by multiplying 2 by p by q. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Actually, no\u2014because the formula is 2pq, which in this case is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But hold on, I thought the answer was 32% earlier. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I confused something. Let me go through again. The total percentage is made up of three parts: homozygous dominant (p\u00b2), heterozygous (2pq), and homozygous recessive (q\u00b2). We know q\u00b2 is 16%, so q is 0.4. Then p is 0.6. Calculating 2pq: 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. Hmm, but the options don't include 48% except F, which is 48%. However, looking back at the problem statement, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe they consider the percentage of students who can't roll their tongue as those who are either hh, hf, or ff? No, wait, actually, the recessive phenotype is only expressed when both alleles are recessive. So, the 16% is all individuals who are homozygous recessive. Then, the remaining 84% are either heterozygous or dominant homozygous.

So p\u00b2 is 0.36, which is the frequency of dominant homozygotes. Adding that to 2pq (which is 0.48) plus q\u00b2 (0.16) should equal 1. Indeed, 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, they're asking for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. To find this out, we'll need to use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps predict allele frequencies in a population under certain assumptions. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). In this case, since q\u00b2 equals the proportion of homozygous recessives, which is 16%, we can solve for q.\n\nSo, q\u00b2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of both sides gives q = 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (t) is 40%. Now, knowing that p + q = 1 (since these are the only two alleles), p would be 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNext, the percentage of heterozygotes (the 2pq term) is calculated by multiplying 2 by p by q. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Actually, no\u2014because the formula is 2pq, which in this case is 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. But hold on, I thought the answer was 32% earlier. Did I make a mistake somewhere?\n\nWait, maybe I confused something. Let me go through again. The total percentage is made up of three parts: homozygous dominant (p\u00b2), heterozygous (2pq), and homozygous recessive (q\u00b2). We know q\u00b2 is 16%, so q is 0.4. Then p is 0.6. Calculating 2pq: 2*0.6*0.4=0.48, which is 48%. Hmm, but the options don't include 48% except F, which is 48%. However, looking back at the problem statement, perhaps there's a different approach. Maybe they consider the percentage of students who can't roll their tongue as those who are either hh, hf, or ff? No, wait, actually, the recessive phenotype is only expressed when both alleles are recessive. So, the 16% is all individuals who are homozygous recessive. Then, the remaining 84% are either heterozygous or dominant homozygous. But how do we split them into dominant and heterozygous?\n\nIn the Hardy-Weinberg model, the sum p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1 represents all possible genotypes. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, then p\u00b2 is (1 - q)\u00b2. Wait, no\u2014that's not correct. Instead, p = 1 - q, so p\u00b2 is (1 - q)\u00b2. Since q = 0.4, p = 0.6. So p\u00b2 is 0.36, which is the frequency of dominant homozygotes. Adding that to 2pq (which is 0.48) plus q\u00b2 (0.16) should equal 1. Indeed, 0.36 + 0.48 + 0.16 = 1. So that checks out. \n\nBut the question asks specifically for the percentage of heterozygotes, which is 2pq = 0.48, so 48%. Looking at the options provided, option F is 48 percent. So why did I initially think of another approach leading to 32%? Perhaps I misapplied the formula.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. \n\nNow, we're asked to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous\u2014meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes would be able to roll their tongues since they express the dominant trait.\n\nTo solve this, I think we'll use the Hardy-Weinberg principle, which helps calculate genotype frequencies in a population under certain assumptions. The basic equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele, q is the recessive, p\u00b2 is the frequency of homozygous dominant, 2pq is the heterozygous, and q\u00b2 is the recessive homozygous.\n\nIn this case, since 16% (q\u00b2) cannot roll their tongue, we know that q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which gives us q = 0.4. Then, p, the frequency of the dominant allele, would be 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nNext, we calculate the frequency of heterozygotes using 2pq. Plugging in the numbers, we get 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that back to a percentage, 0.48 is 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the answer options don't include 48% as correct? Let me double-check my calculations.

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt.",

    "rollout": " \n\nNow, they're asking what percentage of the students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. Heterozygotes would express the dominant trait, so they can roll their tongue. To find out how many are heterozygous, we need to use some basic probability principles from population genetics.\n\nSince 16% are tt, that means 16% of the students don't show the trait. In a diploid organism like humans, each person has two alleles for a given gene. So, the total percentage of people who are either TT or Tt can be calculated by subtracting the percentage of tt individuals from 100%. That gives us 100% - 16% = 84% of the students who are either homozygous dominant (TT) or heterozygous (Tt).\n\nBut wait, how do we know how much of these 84% are TT versus Tt? That depends on the frequency of the alleles. Let's denote p as the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q as the frequency of the recessive allele (t). We know that p + q = 1 because these are the only two alleles. Also, since 16% are tt, which corresponds to q^2 = 0.16. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives q = 0.4. Therefore, p = 1 - q = 0.6.\n\nThe frequency of heterozygotes (Tt) is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%.

But assuming Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium holds, which it does in many cases, the distribution would follow p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1. Here, p^2 is the proportion of TT, which is (0.6)^2 = 0.36 or 36%, and 2pq is 0.48 or 48%. So, adding these together: 36% + 48% = 84%, which matches the earlier figure.

Heterozygous means they have one dominant and one recessive allele, so their genotype would be Tt. To find the percentage of heterozygotes, I'll need to use some Punnett square calculations or understand the Hardy-Weinberg principle since the population is assumed to be large and randomly mating.\n\nFirst, let's figure out the frequency of the t allele. Since 16% are tt, which is the homozygous recessive genotype, each individual has two alleles. So, the frequency of t in the population is the square root of 0.16 because (frequency of t)^2 = frequency of tt. The square root of 0.16 is 0.4, which means 40% of the population carries the recessive allele. Therefore, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) should be 1 - 0.4 = 0.6 or 60%. \n\nUsing the Hardy-Weinberg equation p^2 + 2pq + q^2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive, we can calculate the frequencies. We know q^2 = 0.16, so q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Then p = 1 - q = 0.6.
