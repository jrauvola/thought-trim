Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. In this case, since the recessive phenotype is 16%, which is q\u00b2, we can solve for q first. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele (t) is 40%. Consequently, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) would be p = 1 - q = 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNow, the heterozygotes would have a frequency represented by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, the options given don't include 48% yet. Let me check again. Oh, no, option F is 48%, so that should be the answer. But wait, earlier I thought the correct answer might be different because sometimes these questions involve another approach, maybe considering actual counts rather than percentages. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in calculating 2pq. Let me recalculate:\n\np = 0.6, q = 0.4.\n\n2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is indeed 48%. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%, which corresponds to option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Here, since 16% of the population has the recessive genotype (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That makes sense because 0.4 squared is 0.16.\n\nNow, knowing q, I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This tells me that the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 0.6 or 60%, and the recessive allele (t) is 40%.\n\nThe next part of the problem asks for the percentage of heterozygotes. Heterozygotes would have the genotype Tt. In the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nFirst, I'll recall that in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes are calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Here, since 16% of the population has the recessive genotype (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That makes sense because 0.4 squared is 0.16.\n\nNow, knowing q, I can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. This tells me that the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 0.6 or 60%, and the recessive allele (t) is 40%.\n\nThe next part of the problem asks for the percentage of heterozygotes. Heterozygotes would have the genotype Tt. In the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values I found earlier, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals... let's see, 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48. So, 0.48 corresponds to 48%. \n\nWait a second, but let me double-check. Sometimes people get confused between the number of carriers and the actual proportion. But no, in this case, the calculation seems correct. 16% is the recessive homozygote, leading to 48% heterozygotes, and the remaining 40% are dominant homozygotes. That adds up correctly because 16% + 48% + 40% equals 100%. So yeah, 48% should be the right answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.

The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), q is the recessive (t), and pq is the heterozygous frequency. In this case, since 16% are homozygous recessive (tt), that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4.\n\nNow, knowing that p + q = 1, we can solve for p. Substituting q = 0.4 into the equation, we get p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele (T) is 0.6.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. That would be represented by 2pq.

But none of the options show 48%. Hmm, maybe I misread the question. Wait, the question says \"students cannot roll their tongues,\" which implies they're either homozygous tt or perhaps some other condition? No, I think I'm correct. Alternatively, maybe the question expects the percentage of heterozygotes in the population assuming equal distribution among genotypes, but no, the numbers seem straightforward.\n\nWait another thought\u2014maybe the question is referring to the percentage of students who are carriers (heterozygous) relative to all students, not just those who can't roll their tongue. But in that case, the total percentage would still be 48%, which isn't listed. Perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the question. Alternatively, maybe the question is asking for the percentage of students who can roll their tongue, including both carriers and those who can express the trait. Let's see: carriers (heterozygotes) can roll their tongue, and those who are homozygous dominant (TT) also do. So, the total percentage of students who can roll their tongue is TT + heterozygotes. Using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the proportion of TT individuals is p\u00b2 = 0.6\u00b2 = 0.36 or 36%, and heterozygotes are 48%, so together that's 84%. But the question specifically asks for heterozygotes, which is 48%, but that's not an option. Wait, the options go up to J, which is 52%, but I'm getting 48%.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should approach it differently. If 16% can't roll their tongue, that means 84% can. Out of these 84%, how many are heterozygous? Using the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq, which we calculated as 48%. But again, that's 48%, which isn't an option.

Since the recessive phenotype is represented by q\u00b2, which equals 16%, we can find q by taking the square root of 16%. The square root of 16 is 4, so q is 0.04 or 4%. That means the frequency of the dominant allele, p, is 1 - q, which would be 0.96 or 96%.\n\nNow, the heterozygous frequency is given by 2pq. We already know p is 0.96 and q is 0.04. Plugging these into the equation: 2 * 0.96 * 0.04. Let's calculate that. 0.96 multiplied by 0.04 is 0.0384, and then multiplying by 2 gives 0.0768. To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100, resulting in 7.68%. Wait, but none of the options match exactly. Hmm, did I make a mistake somewhere? Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps I should consider the total percentage directly. The sum of all three genotypes (homozygous dominant, heterozygous, homozygous recessive) should equal 100%. So, if q\u00b2 is 16%, that's the homozygous recessive. Then, the heterozygotes are 2pq, and the dominant homozygotes are p\u00b2. Adding them up: p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Since p = 0.96 and q = 0.04, p\u00b2 is 0.9216, q\u00b2 is 0.0016, and 2pq is 0.0768. Adding these together: 0.9216 + 0.0768 = 0.9984 plus 0.0016 equals 1. That checks out. But wait, the question asks specifically for the percentage of heterozygotes, which according to my calculation is approximately 7.68%. However, looking at the options provided, there isn't an option for 7.68%. Maybe I made a miscalculation.\n\nWait another thought: Perhaps I confused p and q. Let me clarify. In the standard Hardy-Weinberg equation, p is the frequency of the dominant allele, and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Since q\u00b2 is 16%, q is indeed 0.04 or 4%, making p 0.96. Therefore, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq = 2*0.96*0.04 = 0.0768 or 7.68%. But since the options don't include 7.68%, maybe I'm approaching this incorrectly. Perhaps the question assumes that the students are randomly distributed among the phenotypes, implying that the 16% are the homozygous recessives, and the rest are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. So, the remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. If I assume that heterozygotes and dominant homozygotes account for the remaining 84%, how does that affect the calculation?\n\nLet me think differently. Suppose the total number of students is 100. 16 cannot roll their tongue, meaning they're homozygous recessive (tt). The remaining 84 could be either heterozygotes (Tt) or dominant homozygotes (TT). To find the exact percentage of heterozygotes, we need more information, but perhaps the question expects us to use the fact that the sum of all genotypes is 100%. Using the Hardy-Weinberg approach, p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 100%. Here, q\u00b2 is 16, so p\u00b2 + 2pq = 84. Without additional information, we can't determine the exact distribution between TT and Tt. However, the question is asking for heterozygotes, which would be 2pq. Since we have two possible values for 2pq depending on whether the remaining 84% includes both heterozygotes and dominant homozygotes, but without knowing the proportion, we might not have enough data. Alternatively, perhaps the assumption is that the majority are heterozygotes, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question is testing a different approach. Maybe it's considering the actual presence of the allele rather than just the genotype. For example, if 16% cannot roll their tongue (so they don't have the allele), then 84% do have the allele. Among these 84%, some are heterozygotes and some are homozygous dominant. Assuming random segregation, the probability of being heterozygous is 2pq = 2*(0.96)*(0.04) = 0.0768, which is 7.68%. Again, this brings me back to the same figure, but since the options don't include this, I might have misunderstood the question.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is phrased differently. It says \"cannot roll their tongues,\" which implies that they don't have the dominant allele. So, the 16% are homozygous recessive. The remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. To find the percentage of heterozygotes, we'd typically need more information, such as the frequency of the dominant allele or the actual counts of each genotype. Since we don't have that information, perhaps the question assumes that the majority are heterozygotes, but that's speculative.\n\nLooking back at the options: A.36, B.32, C.24, D.40, E.20, F.48, G.68, H.16, I.64, J.52, K.68, L.16, M.64, N.52. None of these match 7.68%. Alternatively, maybe I misinterpreted the question. Perhaps the 16% refers to the percentage of students who can't roll their tongue due to having at least one recessive allele. No, the question clearly states that the inability is due to the recessive allele, so the 16% are homozygous recessive.\n\nAnother angle: Maybe the question is testing the concept of dominance ratios. If 16% are homozygous recessive, then the frequency of the dominant allele is sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84) \u2248 0.9165, which is approximately 91.65%. Then, the frequency of heterozygotes would be 2*p*q = 2*0.9165*0.0835 \u2248 0.1568, which is about 15.68%. Still not matching any of the options.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is simpler. If 16% cannot roll their tongue, which is the homozygous recessive, then the remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. Assuming that the remaining 84% are equally split between the two, that would be 42% heterozygotes and 42% dominant homozygotes. But the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, so 42%. However, 42% isn't an option either. This suggests that perhaps the initial approach is incorrect.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question assumes that all students have either the dominant or recessive allele, so 16% are recessive homozygotes, and the remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. If we assume that the dominant allele is present in all cases except the 16%, then the heterozygotes would be 84% minus dominant homozygotes. But again, without knowing the distribution, it's hard to pin down.\n\nWait, perhaps the question is trying to trick me by assuming that the 16% are the ones who can't roll their tongue because they have at least one recessive allele, which is not the case here. Because in reality, the recessive allele doesn't cause the trait; it's the dominant allele that causes it. So, the 16% are homozygous recessive, meaning they don't show the trait even though they have the recessive allele.\n\nMaybe I should re-examine the math. If q\u00b2 = 0.16, then q = 0.4, so p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Then, the heterozygote frequency is 2*p*q = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. Option F is 48%, so perhaps that's the answer intended. But why would the question specify the dominance and recessiveness if the answer comes directly from q squared?\n\nAh, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The question is straightforward: 16% cannot roll their tongue because they are homozygous recessive. The remaining 84% are either heterozygotes or dominant homozygotes. But since the question asks specifically for heterozygotes, and without further information, it's impossible to determine exactly unless we assume that the majority are heterozygotes. However, in reality, the heterozygote frequency is 48%, so perhaps the correct answer is F.48%.\n\nBut earlier calculations showed 7.68%, which is close to 8%, but still not exact. Alternatively, perhaps the question is assuming that the students are randomly distributed among the three phenotypes, so the heterozygotes are 2pq, and since q\u00b2=0.16, pq=0.4*sqrt(0.16)=0.4*0.4=0.16, so 2pq=0.32, which is 32%. That matches option B.32%. Wait, let me check that.\n\nIf q\u00b2=0.16, then q=0.4, so p=0.6. Then, pq=0.6*0.4=0.24. Therefore, 2pq=0.48, which is 48%.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nFirst, I remember that in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive. Here, since 16% are tt, that means q\u00b2 equals 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q is 0.4, meaning the recessive allele makes up 40% of the population. That would imply that p, the dominant allele, is 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNow, to find the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt), I use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's calculate that: 0.6 times 0.4 is 0.24, multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. So, 48% of the students are heterozygous. Looking at the options provided, F is 48%, so that should be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

We know that q\u00b2 equals the proportion of people who can't roll their tongue, which is 16%. So, q squared is 0.16. To find q, I take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4.

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of these genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele.

Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which is usually assumed unless stated otherwise, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the formula p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Here, since 16% are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (because all alleles are either T or t), p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, we're looking for the heterozygous frequency, which is 2pq. Plugging in the values, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48. Converting that to a percentage, 0.48 * 100 = 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that calculation because sometimes I mix up the formulas. Oh no, wait, 0.6 times 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is 48%, not 36%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me go through again.\n\nIf 16% are tt, then q\u00b2=0.16 \u2192 q=0.4. Then p=0.6. Heterozygous is 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. But none of the options provided include 48%. Wait, let me check the options again. A.36, B.32, C.24, D.40, E.20, F.48, G.68, H.16, I.64, J.52, K.52? Wait, actually, the user provided only up to J.52, so perhaps there was an error in the initial options. Alternatively, maybe I miscalculated. Let me recalculate:\n\nq\u00b2 = 0.16 \u21d2 q = sqrt(0.16) = 0.4. Correct. p = 1 - q = 0.6. Hetero = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 \u21d2 48%. But the options don't have 48%. Maybe the correct answer is F.48%.\n\nWait, but another approach: sometimes when the recessive phenotype occurs in a certain proportion, we might assume that it's due to incomplete dominance, but the question states it's a dominant-recessive system, so it's likely strictly a 1:1 ratio between dominant and recessive phenotypes. Alternatively, maybe the assumption is that 16% are homozygous recessive, so the remaining 84% are either dominant homozygous or heterozygotes. But without knowing the distribution between these two, we can't determine the exact heterozygote percentage. However, under Hardy-Weinberg, the heterozygote frequency is 2pq, which we've calculated as 48% based on q\u00b2=0.16. Since 48% isn't an option, perhaps I'm missing something. Alternatively, maybe the question assumes that 16% are affected, implying that the recessive phenotype is 16%, so the heterozygotes would be the majority. Wait, but according to my calculations, it's 48%, which is option F. So, despite the discrepancy in the options, F seems to be the closest match.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Hmm, that contradicts my earlier result. What am I missing here? \n\nAh, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Wait, no\u2014actually, if q is 4%, then p is 96%. Then 2pq would be 2*96%*4% = 7.68%, still not matching the previous answer. This inconsistency suggests I might have misunderstood the problem. Maybe the 16% refers to the actual count rather than the percentage. Or perhaps there's more to the scenario beyond just the simple Hardy-Weinberg model. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the question is testing the understanding that if 16% cannot roll their tongue, that's q\u00b2, so q is 4%, and then the heterozygotes are 2pq = 2*(p)*(q) = 2*(0.96)*(0.04) = 0.0768, which is 7.68%, but again, none of the options match this. \n\nWait, looking back at the options, E is 20%, which is close to 7.68%, but that's not exactly correct. Perhaps I'm overcomplicating things. Let me think differently. If 16% cannot roll their tongue, that's the recessive phenotype, so q\u00b2 = 0.16 \u2192 q = 0.4. Then, the frequency of carriers (heterozygotes) is 2pq = 2*(0.6)*(0.4) = 0.48, which is 48%. So, according to this calculation, the percentage of heterozygotes is 48%, which is option F. \n\nBut wait, why didn't I get 7.68% before? Oh, right, because I incorrectly assumed p was 96% instead of 0.96 (which is 96%). So, recalculating: 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%, matching option F. So, despite the confusion, the correct answer should be 48%, which is option F.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nFirst, I remember that in a population, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg equation: p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. Here, p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since the recessive phenotype is tt, which is q\u00b2, and we know that 16% can't roll their tongue (so q\u00b2 = 0.16), we can solve for q. Taking the square root of 0.16 gives us q = 0.4. \n\nNow, knowing that p + q = 1 (since these are the only two alleles), we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. \n\nThe next part is finding the frequency of heterozygotes (Tt). The formula for the frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq.

Unless the question assumes that all non-tt individuals are heterozygotes, but that doesn't make sense biologically because some could be TT. Wait, but maybe the problem assumes that the only possibility is heterozygotes and TT, which wouldn't fit. Alternatively, perhaps the answer provided expects a different calculation. Maybe I should consider that in a diploid organism, the percentage of carriers is calculated differently. For example, if 16% are non-carriers (tt), then 84% are carriers (either TT or Tt). If the carrier percentage is split equally between TT and Tt, then each would be 42%, making the heterozygote 42%, but that's not an option here. Alternatively, if the carriers are all heterozygotes, then 84% would be Tt, but that also isn't an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the percentage of carriers in a population. The formula for the percentage of carriers is 100*(2pq)/(p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2)*100%. Since p + q = 1, and p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4, p=0.6. Then, 2pq = 2*0.6*0.4 = 0.48, so 48% of the population are heterozygotes. But since 48% isn't an option, maybe I made a mistake.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the frequencies of the genotypes are given by p\u00b2, 2pq, and q\u00b2, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since 16% are tt, that means q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, I'll take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. So, q = 0.4. Since p + q = 1 (as these are the only two alleles), p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the percentage of heterozygotes (Tt) would be 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but none of the options say 48%, unless I made a mistake somewhere. Let me double-check.\n\nWait, maybe I misread the question. It says 16% can't roll their tongue, which implies they're all tt, right? So, yes, q\u00b2 = 0.16 leads to q = 0.4. Then, p = 0.6. Heterozygotes are 2pq = 0.48, which is 48%. But looking back at the options, there's no 48%. Hmm, maybe I messed up somewhere else. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, like considering the total number of students and calculating based on the percentage of carriers. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to calculate the percentage of carriers using another method, such as considering the possible percentages of each genotype. \n\nLet me think again. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming random mating, the proportion of heterozygotes would depend on how many are TT and how many are Tt. However, without knowing the exact distribution between TT and Tt, it's impossible to determine exactly the percentage of heterozygotes from just the tt information alone. Unless the question assumes that all non-tt individuals are heterozygotes, but that doesn't make sense biologically because some could be TT.

Alternatively, if the carriers are all heterozygotes, then 84% would be Tt, but that also isn't an option. \n\nWait, perhaps the correct approach is to use the formula for the percentage of carriers in a population. The formula for the percentage of carriers is 100*(2pq)/(p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2)*100%. Since p + q = 1, and p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1. We know that q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = 0.4, p=0.6.

We know tt is 16%, so the remaining 84% (100% - 16%) are TT and Tt. These two categories together make up 84%, and since they're in a ratio of 3:1 (because in the absence of dominance, the genotypes would be 3/4 TT and 1/4 Tt), the heterozygotes are 3 parts out of 4.

The problem states that the ability is determined by a dominant allele, implying that the trait follows Mendel's laws.

Because if the recessive trait is absent, the genotypes are either TT or Tt. In a diploid organism without any dominance, these would occur in a 3:1 ratio. So, the proportion of heterozygotes would be 3/(3+1) = 75% of the individuals who don't have the recessive trait. Since 16% have the recessive trait, 84% do not. So, 75% of 84% is 63%. That suggests that the heterozygous frequency is 63%, which conflicts with the earlier result.\n\nThis inconsistency indicates that I might be misapplying the principles.

So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the genotypic frequencies are given by p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). Since q\u00b2 equals the frequency of the homozygous recessive genotype, which is 16%, we can find q by taking the square root of 0.16. That would give us q = 0.4. Then, since p + q = 1, p would be 0.6.\n\nThe heterozygous frequency is represented by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but none of the options match 48%. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Let me check again. Oh wait, the question asks for heterozygotes, not the total number of individuals. But actually, no\u2014the calculation for heterozygotes should still hold because 2pq already accounts for all heterozygotes. So, 48% seems correct, but looking back at the options, F is 48%, so that might be the answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

So, q squared is 0.16, meaning q is the square root of 0.16. Let me calculate that: sqrt(0.16) is 0.4, so q is 0.4 or 40%.\n\nKnowing that q is 0.4, we can find p by subtracting q from 1.

In this case, since q\u00b2 equals the frequency of the homozygous recessive individuals (tt), which is 16%, we can write q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4.

But looking at the options provided, option F is 48%. However, I recall that sometimes the heterozygosity can also be calculated as 1 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Let me check that way too. We know p\u00b2 is 0.36 and q\u00b2 is 0.16. Adding them gives 0.52, and subtracting from 1 gives 0.48, which matches my previous calculation.

Yes, in the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes is indeed 2pq. Here, p is 0.6, q is 0.4, so 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. That makes sense.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population, the frequency of each genotype can be calculated using the Hardy-Weinberg principle. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). In this case, since q\u00b2 equals the frequency of the homozygous recessive individuals (tt), which is 16%, we can write q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele, q, is 0.4 or 40%. \n\nNow, since p + q = 1, we can find p by subtracting q from 1. So, p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6, which is 60%. The frequency of the dominant allele, p, is 60%. \n\nNext, the question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous. Heterozygotes are those who have one T and one t allele, represented by the genotype Tt. The proportion of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values we have, 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, which is 48%. Wait, but hold on, I think I might have made a mistake there. Let me double-check. Actually, 2pq is correct, but maybe I should calculate it again. 0.6 multiplied by 0.4 is 0.24, and then multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, which is indeed 48%. But looking at the options provided, option F is 48%. However, I recall that sometimes the heterozygosity can also be calculated as 1 - (p\u00b2 + q\u00b2). Let me check that way too. We know p\u00b2 is 0.36 and q\u00b2 is 0.16. Adding them gives 0.52, and subtracting from 1 gives 0.48, which matches my previous calculation. So, yes, 48% seems right.\n\nWait a second, but the options don't include 48% yet. Let me look back at the options provided:\n\nA. 36%\n\nB. 32%\n\nC. 24%\n\nD. 40%\n\nE. 20%\n\nF. 48%\n\nG. 68%\n\nH. 16%\n\nI. 64%\n\nJ. 52%\n\nSo, F is 48%, which aligns with my calculations. Hmm, but earlier I thought maybe it was 40%, but no, the math shows it's 48%. Maybe I confused something else. Alternatively, perhaps I misapplied the formula. Let me verify once more. Yes, in the Hardy-Weinberg equation, the frequency of heterozygotes is indeed 2pq. Here, p is 0.6, q is 0.4, so 2*0.6*0.4=0.48 or 48%. That makes sense. So, the correct answer should be F, 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which this probably follows since no information suggests otherwise, the frequencies of the genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the frequency of the recessive allele. Here, since all the tt individuals (q\u00b2) make up 16%, that means q\u00b2 equals 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That tells us that 40% of the population has the recessive allele. Since p + q = 1, p must be 0.6 or 60%. \n\nNow, to find the percentage of students who are heterozygous (meaning they have one T and one t), we use the formula 2pq. Plugging in the values we found, p is 0.6 and q is 0.4, so 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 equals 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014the answer options don't include 48% as option F, which is 48%.

In terms of the Hardy-Weinberg formula, the frequency of heterozygotes is represented by 2pq. Plugging in our values, that would be 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Calculating that: 2 * 0.6 is 1.2, multiplied by 0.4 gives 0.48. So, 0.48 corresponds to 48% of the students being heterozygous.\n\nWait, but let me double-check. If 16% are tt, then the remaining 84% are TT and Tt combined. Since the total is 100%, subtracting the tt (16%) leaves 84%. But according to the Hardy-Weinberg, the frequency of heterozygotes should actually be 2pq, which in this case is indeed 48%. So, yes, the correct answer should be 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a Hardy-Weinberg population, which this seems to fit since there's no mention of selection or other evolutionary forces, the frequencies of the genotypes follow certain rules. The formula is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T), and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). In this case, since 16% are homozygous recessive (tt), that corresponds to q\u00b2. So, q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means q = 0.4.\n\nNow, knowing q, we can find p using the fact that p + q = 1. So, p = 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. So, the frequency of the dominant allele T is 0.6, and t is 0.4.\n\nThe question asks for the percentage of students who are heterozygous, which means they have one T and one t allele. The heterozygous frequency is represented by the term 2pq. Plugging in the values, that would be 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let's calculate that:\n\nFirst, multiply 0.6 and 0.4: 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.24.\nThen, multiply by 2: 2 * 0.24 = 0.48.\n\nSo, 0.48 corresponds to 48%, which matches option F. But wait, let me double-check everything to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. We started with 16% being homozygous recessive, found q as 0.4, then p as 0.6.

Alternatively, perhaps the 16% includes all non-tongued students, including both tt and others, but in reality, only tt expresses the trait.

But since 48% isn't an option, perhaps I made an error earlier. Let me think again: could the question be asking for the percentage of heterozygotes among those who can roll their tongue? In that case, the number of TT students would be p\u00b2=0.36, and the number of Tt students would be 2pq=0.48. So, the percentage of heterozygotes among those who can roll their tongue would be 0.48/(0.36+0.48)=0.48/0.84\u224857.14%, which isn't an option either. Alternatively, maybe the question is simply asking for the percentage of heterozygotes regardless of whether they can roll their tongue, which would be 48%.

But why would that be the case?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question assumes that the percentage of non-tongued students is 16%, which is q\u00b2=0.16\u2192q=0.4. Then, the percentage of heterozygotes is 2pq=48%, but since that's not an option, perhaps the intended answer was 40%, thinking that p=0.5 (if it were a 50-50 split), but that's incorrect. Alternatively, perhaps the question expects a different approach, such as considering that 16% can't roll, so 84% can, and then using the fact that the percentage of heterozygotes is equal to the percentage of carriers, which is usually around 48-52%, depending on the allele frequency.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population, the Hardy-Weinberg principle helps calculate allele frequencies without assuming random mating. The equation is p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele and q is the recessive one. Since the recessive phenotype is 16%, which corresponds to q\u00b2 = 0.16. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. That means the frequency of the recessive allele is 40%. Therefore, the dominant allele's frequency p is 1 - q, which is 0.6 or 60%.\n\nNow, the question asks for the percentage of heterozygotes, which would be represented by 2pq. Plugging in the numbers: 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48 or 48%. Wait, but hold on\u2014that contradicts the answer choices given. Let me check again. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake. Because the total percentage should add up correctly. Let's see: 16% (tt) + 48% (Tt) + 36% (TT) = 100%. But none of the options include 48%. Hmm. Maybe I misapplied the formula. Alternatively, perhaps the question refers to the percentage of individuals who are carriers (heterozygotes), which would indeed be 2pq. So, 2*0.6*0.4=0.48=48%. But looking back at the options, E is 20%, D is 40%, C is 24%, etc. Wait, 48% isn't an option. Did I miscalculate? No, 0.6*0.4=0.24, multiplied by 2 gives 0.48. So perhaps the correct answer isn't listed, but that's unlikely. Maybe I misunderstood the initial information.\n\nWait another thought\u2014maybe the students who can't roll their tongue aren't just the tt genotype. Perhaps there are other factors, but no, the question states that it's a dominant-recessive system. So, the 16% is all the tt individuals. Then, the rest, which is 84%, must be either TT or Tt. Among these, the proportion of heterozygotes (Tt) would be 2pq. Since p + q =1, and q=0.4, p=0.6. Therefore, 2*0.6*0.4=0.48=48%, which still isn't an option.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I've got this genetics problem here about tongue rolling and dominant/recessive alleles. Let me try to break it down step by step. The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'. Therefore, the genotype for those who can't roll their tongue is tt. Now, we need to find out what percentage of students are heterozygous, meaning they have one T and one t allele. \n\nIn a population at Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which seems to apply here since there's no mention of selection, mutation, genetic drift, or migration, the frequency of genotypes can be calculated using the equation p\u00b2 + 2pq + q\u00b2 = 1, where p is the frequency of the dominant allele (T) and q is the frequency of the recessive allele (t). We know that q\u00b2 equals the frequency of the homozygous recessive individuals, which is 16%. To find q, we take the square root of 0.16, which is 0.4. Therefore, q = 0.4.\n\nSince p + q = 1 (because all alleles add up to 100%), p would be 1 - q = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. Now, the frequency of heterozygotes is given by 2pq. Plugging in the values, that's 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, or 48%. Wait, but let me double-check that. Oh, wait, maybe I made a mistake somewhere. Alternatively, another approach could be to consider that 16% are tt, so the remaining 84% are either TT or Tt. Assuming Hardy-Weinberg, the ratio of TT:Tt:t\u00b2 should be approximately 25:50:16. But wait, that adds up to 81%, not 100%. Hmm, perhaps I should use the exact calculation instead of approximations. Let me recalculate:\n\nGiven q\u00b2 = 0.16, so q = \u221a0.16 = 0.4. Then p = 1 - 0.4 = 0.6. The frequency of heterozygotes is 2pq = 2 * 0.6 * 0.4 = 0.48, which is 48%. That makes sense because in a population where 16% are homozygous recessive, 84% are either homozygous dominant or heterozygous. Using the formula, 2pq is indeed 48%.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is C",

Therefore, p would be 1 - q, which is 0.6. \n\nNow, to find the percentage of heterozygotes, which is represented by the term 2pq, we plug in the values. So, 2 times p (which is 0.6) times q (which is 0.4) equals 2 * 0.6 * 0.4. Let me calculate that: 0.6 multiplied by 0.4 is 0.24, and then multiplying by 2 gives 0.48, or 48%. \n\nWait, but hold on\u2014let me double-check that calculation. 0.6 * 0.4 is indeed 0.24, and doubling that does give 0.48, which is 48%. That seems correct based on the information given. So, the percentage of students who are heterozygous is 48%.\n\nLooking back at the options provided:\n\nA. 36%\n\nB. 32%\n\nC. 24%\n\nD. 40%\n\nE. 20%\n\nF. 48%\n\nG. 68%\n\nH. 16%\n\nI. 64%\n\nJ. 52%\n\nSo, F. 48% matches our calculation. I think that's the right answer.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is F",

The question says that being able to roll your tongue is determined by a dominant gene, and if you can't, it's because you have a recessive allele. So, it's like a simple Mendelian trait where one allele gives the trait (rolling tongue) and the other doesn't. They tell us that 16% of the students can't roll their tongues. Since the recessive trait isn't expressed when both alleles are recessive, those 16% must be homozygous recessives. So, let's denote the dominant allele as 'T' and the recessive as 't'.
