Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception.",

The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception.",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about operant conditioning and something called a \"Skinner box.\" I'm not exactly sure what a Skinner box is, but from what I remember, it's related to experiments conducted by B.F. Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors. That fits with Skinner's work, especially his famous experiment with dogs salting in front of a light. Option H is about measuring IQ with animals. That doesn't align with Skinner's methods since he focused on observable responses and not mental ability. Option I mentions a device that measures IQ. No, that's unrelated. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That doesn't fit Skinner's use of rewards and punishments. Option K isn't here, so I can ignore it. Finally, option L isn't listed either. So, putting it all together, the best answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors. Skinner did work on classical conditioning, especially with involuntary behaviors like aggressive acts, but his main focus was on association and extinction. Option H refers to IQ measurement, which is a modern approach, not Skinner's original method. Option I is about an IQ device, which isn't Skinner's contribution. Option J suggests observing drug effects without reinforcement. That rings a bell; sometimes researchers use controlled environments to test specific interventions without the added complexity of reinforcement contingency. Option K (not here) would be about testing drug effects without reinforcement, similar to J. Finally, option L (also not here) might relate to animal behavior studies. But since we don't have L, I'll stick to what I have. So after going through each option, D seems to correctly explain the use of a Skinner box in operant conditioning. It uses reinforcement and punishment to train behaviors, which aligns perfectly with Skinner's methods.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G refers to classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors. Skinner's work involved voluntary behaviors, so this doesn't fit. Option H talks about IQ measurement. That's outside the scope of Skinner box experiments; they focused on observable behaviors, not intelligence. Option I mentions measuring IQ, which isn't relevant here. Option J says it's for observing drug effects without reinforcement. That's similar to other experiments but still unrelated to Skinner box's use in operant conditioning. Finally, Option K isn't listed, but I assume there was an option missing. So putting it all together, the correct answer should be D.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. I think Skinner was into both classical and operant conditioning, but his original experiments focused more on classical conditioning with rewards. Option H refers to IQ measurement. That doesn't fit with Skinner's work either; he didn't measure intelligence. Option I is about measuring IQ, which I don't think is accurate. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That's more like behavioral testing without Skinner's specific methods. Option K isn't here, so I can ignore it. Option L isn't an option either. Wait, actually looking back, the options given are A to J, so I should stick to those.

I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. I'm not sure if Skinner boxes focus on involuntary behaviors, especially since they often use controlled environments. Option H mentions IQ measurement. That doesn't fit; Skinner boxes aren't about testing intelligence. Option I is about measuring IQ, which I already ruled out. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That aligns with Skinner's approach because he wanted to study the effects of behavior alone. Option K isn't provided here, so I can't consider it. Finally, option L isn't listed either. Wait, looking back, the options are A-J, so there must be an issue. In my initial response, I considered up to G, H, etc., but perhaps some options weren't fully addressed. Maybe I missed some letters. Oh, wait, the user initially had A to J, but in their latest query, they didn't include all. Hmm, perhaps I should check the original list again.

Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That's more about psychological testing, not Skinner boxes. Option K? Wait, no, the options provided stop at J.

The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect.

Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about operant conditioning and something called a \"Skinner box.\" I'm not exactly sure what a Skinner box is, but from what I remember, it's related to experiments conducted by B.F. Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. I'm not sure if Skinner boxes are used for classical conditioning, especially involuntary ones. Option H is about measuring IQ. Definitely not related to Skinner boxes since they deal with animal behavior, not cognitive tests. Option I relates to IQ measurement, same reasoning as H. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That aligns more with another experiment, perhaps the Krueger-Jones task, where behavior changes due to external factors. Option K isn't listed here, so I'll skip it. Option L isn't given either. Finally, Option M isn't present, so I'll ignore it. Looking back at the initial options provided, the answer choices are A through J. So based on my analysis, the correct choice should be D because it directly describes how Skinner boxes use rewards and punishments to influence animal behavior.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about operant conditioning and something called a \"Skinner box.\" I'm not exactly sure what a Skinner box is, but from what I remember, it's related to experiments conducted by B.F. Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors. Skinner boxes were part of classical conditioning experiments, focusing on associative learning between stimuli and responses. Option H refers to IQ measurement. Skinner boxes aren't directly used for assessing intelligence; they're more about behavioral learning. Option I is about measuring IQ, which we've already ruled out. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. That's more aligned with other experiments involving manipulative methods, not Skinner boxes. Finally, Option K isn't listed, so I can ignore it. After considering each option, D clearly fits best because it aligns with Skinner's method of rewarding and punishing to influence behavior.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G refers to classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. Skinner did work on classical conditioning, especially with responses like pecking at food, which are involuntary. Option H talks about IQ measurement, which isn't directly related to Skinner's work. Option I is about an IQ device, which also doesn't fit. Option J discusses observing drug effects without reinforcement. Skinner's original experiments included controlling for other variables, including drugs, but he didn't use specific drugs; they were controlled in his experiments. So J might not be accurate either. Finally, option K wasn't listed here, so we can ignore it. Based on this analysis, D seems to be the best answer because it aligns with the core idea of Skinner boxes being used to train behaviors through rewarding or punishing stimuli.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

That doesn't fit either; Skinner's work involved rewarding and punishing. Option K isn't listed here. Option L isn't given. Finally, option M isn't mentioned. Wait, looking back at the options, there's an option missing. Option N isn't present. Since none match perfectly, perhaps the closest is D. Alternatively, considering other options, option D is the most accurate because it directly ties Skinner boxes to operant conditioning principles of reward and punishment.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood.

Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. I'm not sure if Skinner box focuses on involuntary behaviors, especially since he studied voluntary ones.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about operant conditioning and something called a \"Skinner box.\" I'm not exactly sure what a Skinner box is, but from what I remember, it's related to experiments conducted by B.F. Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors. Skinner was into classical conditioning, especially with reflexes and voluntary behaviors, so G could be correct. Option H is about measuring IQ. That doesn't fit with Skinner's work since he focused on observable responses, not innate intelligence. Option I refers to an IQ test device. Doesn't align with Skinner's methods. Option J says it's used to observe drug effects without reinforcement. Skinner boxes typically use rewards to study behavior, so this might not be accurate unless there's some confusion between different experiments. Option K isn't listed here, so I'll skip it. Option L isn't available either. Finally, Option M isn't provided. Wait, the user didn't list M, so I should check if I missed anything. Oh, perhaps I miscounted the letters. Looking back at the original question, it had up to option J, which ends with |im_end|. Maybe there was a typo. But in my analysis, D and G seem plausible. Let me think again. D is definitely about rewarding or punishing to increase or decrease behavior, which matches Skinner's method. G is about classical conditioning with involuntary behaviors, which also fits because Skinner worked on voluntary behaviors. However, the exact term might be \"classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors,\" which would make G correct. Alternatively, D is broader and still relevant. Since both D and G seem possible, I need to decide which one is better. In operant conditioning, Skinner's famous experiments included teaching rats to press a lever repeatedly by rewarding them each time they did. These were often associated with voluntary behaviors, which falls under classical conditioning. So G might be a better answer. But D is also important because it describes the process of using rewards and punishments, which is a core principle of Skinner's approach.\n</think>\nThe correct answer is D",

The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation.

Answer:<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>assistant\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this question about operant conditioning and something called a \"Skinner box.\" I'm not exactly sure what a Skinner box is, but from what I remember, it's related to experiments conducted by B.F. Skinner. He wanted to study how animals learn through rewards and punishments. The question asks which option explains how a Skinner box can be used in operant conditioning. The options are A through J, each giving a different explanation. First, I need to understand what each option means. Let me go through them one by one. Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception. Option G talks about classical conditioning involving involuntary behaviors. Skinner was more into operant conditioning, focusing on voluntary behaviors, so G might be incorrect. Option H refers to IQ measurement. Definitely unrelated; Skinner boxes aren't about testing intelligence. Option I says it measures IQ. No way! Option J mentions observing drug effects without reinforcement. Skinner did use experiments with drugs to test their effects, but that's separate from Skinner boxes. Finally, option K isn't listed here, so perhaps the assistant missed it, but since it's not an option, I'll skip it.

Option A says Skinner box automatically trains animals to perform complex tasks without reinforcement. That doesn't sound right because Skinner boxes were designed to provide immediate rewards, like food or treats, to encourage learning. So A seems incorrect. Option B claims it's a tool for enhancing cognitive abilities through puzzle exposure. While puzzles do help with problem-solving and cognitive skills, I don't recall Skinner boxes specifically training animals through solving puzzles. They're more about reinforcing desired actions. Option C suggests it's used for memory exercises. Again, I think Skinner boxes focus on training behaviors, not just memorizing information. They're more about teaching through positive reinforcement rather than recalling facts. Option D states it's used in operant conditioning to reward or punish a behavior, thus influencing its likelihood. This makes sense because Skinner was all about using rewards and punishments as tools to teach behaviors. So D sounds correct. Option E says it's a punishment device. No, that's too vague. punishment devices might vary, but Skinner boxes specifically target rewards and punishments. Option F mentions sensory deprivation. I know that involves removing stimuli to see effects, but again, that's more related to another experiment, maybe the Watson-Turkey illusion, where deprivation affects perception.",

Skinner did work on classical conditioning, especially with reinforcers and aversions, but the term \"Skinner box\" is usually associated with operant conditioning, not classical.
